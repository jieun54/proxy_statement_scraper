             PROXY STATEMENT FOR 1999 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                       TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY, MAY 11, 1999

     The Board of Directors is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 11, 1999, at 10 a.m., and at all
adjournments thereof, for the purposes set forth in the attached Notice of
Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company anticipates that the proxy
statement and the form of proxy enclosed will first be sent to its stockholders
on or about March 26, 1999.

WHO CAN VOTE

     Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 1999,
are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of February 26, 1999, the
Company had outstanding and entitled to vote 402,390,382 shares of common stock
with par value of $0.50 per share. The 69,626,146 shares of common stock in the
Company's treasury on that date will not be voted.

HOW YOU CAN VOTE BY PROXY

     If you are a registered stockholder (you hold your stock in your own
name), you may vote by one of the following methods:

     *    VIA THE INTERNET, by going to the web address
          http://www.eproxy.com/mmm/ and following the enclosed instructions for
          Internet voting;

     *    TELEPHONE VOTING, by dialing 1-800-240-6326 and following the enclosed
          instructions for telephone voting;

     *    PROXY CARD, by completing and mailing the enclosed proxy card.

     If you return your signed proxy card or use Internet or telephone voting
before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct. You have
three choices on each matter to be voted upon. For the election of directors,
you may vote for (1) all of the nominees, (2) none of the nominees, or (3) all
of the nominees except those you designate. See "Item 1. Election of
Directors." For each of the other items, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or
"ABSTAIN" from voting.

     IF YOU DO NOT SPECIFY ON YOUR PROXY CARD OR THROUGH INTERNET OR TELEPHONE
PROMPTS HOW YOU WANT TO VOTE YOUR SHARES, WE WILL VOTE THEM "FOR" THE ELECTION
OF ALL DIRECTOR NOMINEES, "FOR" RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, AND "FOR"
ADOPTION OF THE EXECUTIVE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, AND AS OTHERWISE RECOMMENDED BY
THE NAMED PROXIES ON ANY OTHER MATTER PROPERLY BEFORE THE MEETING.

     If your shares are held in "street name" (through a broker or other
nominee), you will need to contact your broker or other nominee to determine
whether you will be able to vote electronically via the Internet or by
telephone.

HOW YOU MAY REVOKE OR CHANGE YOUR VOTE

     You can revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual
Meeting by:

     (1)  Sending written notice of revocation to the Secretary;

     (2)  Submitting another proper proxy with a more recent date than that of
          the proxy first given by (i) following the Internet voting
          instructions, or (ii) following the telephone voting instructions, or
          (iii) by signing and returning a proxy card to the Company; or

     (3)  Attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.

     Another person at the meeting may also represent you by executing a proper
proxy designating that person.


                                        1



VOTES REQUIRED/VOTING PROCEDURES

     The nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting will be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting. All other matters submitted to the
stockholders will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
the Company's common stock present or represented and entitled to vote at the
Annual Meeting.

     Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) will be counted as
present or represented at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining
whether a quorum exists. Because abstentions with respect to any matter are
treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote for the purposes
of determining whether that matter has been approved by the stockholders,
abstentions have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes and shares
as to which proxy authority has been withheld with respect to any matter are
not deemed to be present or represented and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining whether stockholder approval of that matter has been obtained and
therefore will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on any such matter.
Proxies submitted by brokers that do not indicate a vote for some of the
proposals because the brokers don't have discretionary voting authority and
haven't received instructions from the beneficial owners on how to vote on
those proposals are called "broker non-votes."

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN AND OTHER PLANS

     Shares held for the account of persons participating in the Company's
dividend reinvestment plan will be voted automatically in accordance with the
vote indicated by the stockholder of record on the proxy. If no choice is
indicated, both record shares and shares held in the Company's dividend
reinvestment plan will be voted "FOR" Items 1, 2, and 3. If the stockholder
does not vote the shares held of record, the individual's shares held in the
dividend reinvestment account will not be voted.

     If a stockholder is a participant in the Company's Voluntary Investment
Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan, or Savings Plan, participants may direct
the trustee how to vote the number of shares allocated to the participant's
account.

     The trustee of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan also votes allocated
shares of common stock for which it has not received direction, as well as
shares not allocated to individual participant accounts, in the same proportion
as directed shares are voted. If voting instructions are invalid or if the
proxy card is not returned by the specified date, the trustee will vote the
shares held in the stockholder's Savings Plan and Voluntary Investment Plan
accounts as directed by the Board of Directors.

COSTS OF SOLICITATION

     The Company will bear the cost of preparing, printing, and mailing
material in connection with this solicitation of proxies. In addition to
mailing material, regular employees of the Company may make solicitations
personally and by telephone. The Company intends to reimburse brokerage firms,
banks, and others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
clerical expenses, related to forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners of
stock or otherwise in connection with this solicitation of proxies. The Company
has retained Georgeson & Co., Inc., to assist in the solicitation at a cost of
approximately $15,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

     The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a policy that all stockholder
proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders are to be
maintained in confidence. No such document shall be available for examination,
nor shall the identity and vote of any stockholder be disclosed, except as may
be necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to allow the inspectors
of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The policy also
provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes shall be independent
and shall not be employees of the Company.

ANNUAL REPORT

     The 1998 Annual Report to Stockholders, which includes the consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 1998, was
mailed on or about March 26, 1999, to all stockholders entitled to vote at the
annual meeting.


                                        2



ITEM 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

NUMBER OF NOMINEES AND CLASSIFICATION

     The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, and
the Bylaws of the Company, as amended, provide that the Board of Directors
shall consist of such number of directors as shall be fixed from time to time
by resolution of the Board of Directors. At its meeting of February 8, 1999,
the Board of Directors fixed the number of directors constituting the entire
Board at eleven, effective as of the date of the 1999 Annual Meeting.

     The Restated Certificate of Incorporation divides the Board into three
classes. Five directors have terms of office that expire at the 1999 Annual
Meeting, and three of the five directors are standing for reelection for a
three-year term as members of the 2002 Class. These are Rozanne L. Ridgway,
Frank Shrontz, and Louis W. Sullivan. Although Allen E. Murray, the fourth
director in the 1999 Class, has reached normal retirement age, the Board has
asked Mr. Murray to serve one more year. As a result of the Board's request,
Mr. Murray is standing for reelection at the 1999 Annual Meeting as a member of
the 2000 Class. Ronald A. Mitsch, the fifth director in the 1999 Class, has
elected to take early retirement and is not standing for reelection at the 1999
Annual Meeting. The four incumbent directors in the 2000 Class are continuing
to serve until the 2000 Annual Meeting. The three incumbent directors in the
2001 Class are continuing to serve until the 2001 Annual Meeting.

     All nominees for election to the Board of Directors to the 2002 Class at
the 1999 Annual Meeting will be elected for a term of three years and shall
serve until their terms expire at the 2002 Annual Meeting or until their
successors are duly elected and have been qualified.

     The persons named as proxies intend to vote the proxies for the election
of the four nominees to the Board of Directors. If any of the nominees should
be unavailable to serve as a director, an event which is not anticipated, the
persons named as proxies reserve full discretion to vote for any other persons
who may be nominated.

INFORMATION AS TO NOMINEES AND INCUMBENT DIRECTORS

     The nominees and incumbent directors, their age, principal occupation or
position with the Company (shown in italics), experience, the year first
elected as a director, and common stock beneficially owned on February 26,
1999, are shown on the following pages.

     "Shares Held" include: stock held in joint tenancy, stock owned as tenants
in common, stock owned or held by spouse or other members of the nominee's
household, and stock in which the nominee either has or shares voting and/or
investment power, even though the nominee disclaims any beneficial interest in
such stock. Options exercisable within 60 days after February 26, 1999, are
shown separately.

     "Shares Held as Deferred Stock" by nonemployee directors represent the
number of shares of the Company's common stock, as of December 31, 1998, which
the directors will receive upon termination of membership on the Board of
Directors for any reason. These shares result from the voluntary election by
the nonemployee directors to defer the payment of directors' fees otherwise
payable in cash into such deferred stock. No shares of common stock have as yet
been issued, and the directors have neither voting nor investment powers in
these shares of deferred stock.

     As of February 26, 1999, executive officers and directors as a group
"beneficially owned" 692,124 shares. Executive officers held options
exercisable within 60 days after that date for 1,135,482 shares. All officers
and directors as a group owned beneficially less than one-half of one percent
(0.5%) of the outstanding common stock of the Company.

     None of the nominees or incumbent directors is related to any other
nominee or to any executive officer of the Company or its subsidiaries by
blood, marriage, or adoption. Except for current employees of the Company and
Dr. Mitsch who retired on November 1, 1998, no nominee or incumbent director
has been an employee of the Company within the past five years.

     During 1998, the Company retained the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
LLP, with regard to various legal matters. Mrs. Peters is a partner in this
firm.

     The executive compensation program is designed to align total compensation
with the Company's strategic objectives and ensure that payouts are driven by
Company performance and employee contribution to the Company. Executive
compensation is linked to Company performance compared to specific financial
and non-financial objectives. These objectives range from achieving earnings
and sales growth targets to upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate
Values (which include customer satisfaction through superior quality and value,
attractive investor return, ethical business conduct, respecting the
environment, and fostering employee pride in the Company).

     In determining the amount and type of executive compensation, the
Committee seeks to achieve the following objectives:

     *    To attract, motivate, and retain talented, competent, and resourceful
          executive officers by providing competitive compensation.

     *    To encourage executives to hold significant amounts of Company stock.

     *    To require that a substantial portion of executive compensation is "at
          risk" by being tied to quantifiable short-term and long-term measures
          of the Company's performance.

PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING COMPENSATION

     The Committee begins the process of establishing the amount of
compensation for the CEO and other executive officers by reviewing compensation
surveys of selected companies. Independent consultants specializing in
executive compensation primarily conduct the surveys. The Company, in
consultation with the independent consultants, selects the companies included
in the compensation surveys. These companies consist of large industrial
companies that are most likely to be competitors for executive talent. The
objective of the Committee is to use the survey data to establish a competitive
level of total compensation. The Committee believes that the Company's most
direct competitors for executive talent are not necessarily all of the
companies that would be included in a group established to compare shareholder
returns. Thus, the group of companies for purposes of the compensation surveys
is not the same as the peer group index (DJIA and S&P 500) in the Comparison of
Five-Year Cumulative Total Return graph included on page 21 of this proxy
statement.

     The Committee does not target any specific quartile of the survey data for
total compensation or any component of total compensation (e.g., base salary,
profit sharing, performance unit plan, or stock options). The Committee's
objective of maintaining the total compensation at a competitive level has
resulted in short-term compensation (base salary and profit sharing cash) and
long-term compensation (performance unit plan, profit sharing stock, and stock
options) being at or very close to the median.

     After the Committee has established the amount of total compensation for
the CEO and other executive officers, the Committee next determines what
percent of the total compensation should be allocated to short-term
compensation in the form of base salary and profit sharing cash and long-term
compensation in the form of the performance unit plan, profit sharing stock,
and stock options. This determination is subjective, but is based on
information from the compensation surveys and the objectives for executive
compensation referred to above. It is the Committee's long-standing policy that
variable, at-risk compensation, both short-term and long-term, should make up a
significant portion of executive compensation. Depending upon the level of the
executive, the Committee targets between 65 percent and 85 percent of executive
compensation to be variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures
of the Company's performance.


                                       10



ELEMENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

     Each of the components of short-term and long-term executive compensation
is described in greater detail below.

BASE SALARY

     The Committee establishes base salaries annually in relation to base
salaries paid by the selected companies from the compensation surveys. Base
salaries may be adjusted from time to time according to guidelines established
for all employees to reflect increased salary levels within the group,
increased responsibilities, or individual performance. This is the only
component of executive compensation that is not variable.

PROFIT SHARING

     Profit sharing is variable compensation based on quarterly performance
measurements for the Company and is used to focus management attention on
profits and the effective use of assets. The Committee, as part of the overall
compensation, determines the number of profit sharing units granted to the CEO
and executive officers to achieve the appropriate ratio between short-term,
performance-based compensation and other forms of compensation, and to reflect
the level of responsibility of the respective executive officer.

     The amount payable with respect to each profit sharing unit has in the
past been determined by dividing the Company's consolidated quarterly net
income, less a quarterly reserve of two and one-half percent of stockholders'
equity (or ten percent on an annual basis), by the number of outstanding shares
of the Company's common stock. No amount would be payable under the profit
sharing plan if the Company's quarterly net income had been equal to or less
than the quarterly reserve of two and one-half percent return on stockholders'
equity. Profit sharing payments are subject to limitations when individual
amounts exceed specified relationships to base salary.

     The Compensation Committee has approved changes to the performance
criteria used to determine variable compensation under the profit sharing plan
in effect for approximately 15,300 employees of the Company in the United
States. The basic change is to replace the quarterly consolidated net income
measurement described above with economic profit. Economic profit is defined as
quarterly net operating income minus a capital charge and emphasizes the
effective use of working capital. Economic profit is generally accepted as a
measurement that relates more directly to the creation of stockholder value. As
the economic profit measurement will be more sensitive to performance of the
Company, it is expected that compensation paid under the new measurement will
tend to rise and fall relatively more sharply than payments under prior
measurement criteria. Although already in effect with regard to approximately
15,300 employees of the Company, requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, dictate that these same changes to the Executive Profit
Sharing Plan must be first approved by the Company's stockholders. This matter
is being presented to stockholders for their approval at the 1999 Annual
Meeting (see Item 3 on page 22).

     For the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, a
portion of profit sharing is paid in cash and a portion is paid in stock which
is held by the Company for three years or until age 65, whichever occurs first.
The ratio between that portion of profit sharing paid in cash and the portion
paid in stock to the named executive officers for 1998 is subjective and varies
from year to year and among executive officers. However, the more senior
executive officers generally have been paid a larger portion of profit sharing
in stock than less senior executive officers. More details about the Company's
Profit Sharing Plan are provided on page 14 of this proxy statement.

PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN

     The Performance Unit Plan is variable compensation based on the Company's
long-term performance. The Committee establishes the number of performance
units allocated to the CEO and executive officers to achieve the appropriate
ratio between long-term, performance-based compensation and other forms of
compensation. The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted
is determined by and is contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria
described below over the applicable three-year performance period (each year
weighted equally).


                                       11



     The current performance criteria have been selected to focus management
attention on two key factors that create shareholder value: Real Growth and
Economic Profit.

     PERFORMANCE CRITERIA:
     (1) "Real Growth" is the percentage amount by which the Company's
worldwide unit sales growth as reported in the Company's Annual Report exceeds
the weighted average of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) of the top seven
industrial nations in which the Company does business (the "Big 7 IPI"); and

     (2) "Economic Profit" is the Company's net operating income (operating
income adjusted for income taxes) less the cost of capital utilized (average
operating capital multiplied by the cost of capital).

     PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN PAYMENTS:
     The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted in 1998
is linked to the performance criteria of Real Growth and Economic Profit. The
payout can vary from $0 to $200 per unit. The payout can be reached by either
performance criteria alone, or by both in combination. The payout for the 1998
Award is payable on May 1, 2001, in the form (at the discretion of the
Committee) of cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. The payout may
be deferred by the participant for three additional years and earn interest at
a specified rate. No amount will be payable under the Amended Performance Unit
Plan if the Company's Real Growth is less than the Big 7 IPI and if Economic
Profit is less than 75 percent of the Economic Profit of the previous three
years.

STOCK OPTIONS

     The Company's Stock Option plan is also variable compensation. It is based
on the market appreciation of the Company's common stock and is designed to
increase ownership of the Company's stock. The Company makes stock option
grants annually at 100 percent of the market price on the date of grant. The
options may be exercised after one year and have a ten-year life. The number of
shares under options to be granted to the CEO and executive officers is
determined by the Committee as part of the overall compensation. The awards are
designed to keep total compensation competitive with awards made by companies
in the survey group, and as such require subjective judgment as to the value of
the award. The number of option shares currently held by each executive is not
considered in determining awards. Stock options encourage executives to become
owners of the Company, which further aligns their interests with the
stockholders. Options have no value unless the price of the Company's stock
increases. Indeed, the options granted during 1998 to the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 14 have been adversely affected
by the market value of the Company's common stock. The stock closed on December
31, 1998, at $71.125 per share. As shown in the Option Grants table on page 17,
the options granted during 1998 to these executive officers ranged from $93.35
per share for the annual grant to $87.35 for grants of Progressive Stock
Options (as explained in footnote 1 on page 17).

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     The compensation of Livio D. DeSimone, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, is determined by the same process and consists of the same
short-term and long-term components as for the other executive officers listed
in the Summary Compensation Table, namely base salary, profit sharing,
performance unit plan, and stock options. A higher portion of Mr. DeSimone's
total compensation is variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable
measures of the Company's performance. These measures are quarterly net income,
Real Growth and Economic Profit, as those terms are defined above, and
appreciation in the value of 3M stock.

     In addition, the compensation paid to Mr. DeSimone is also based on
performance against non-financial measures. These non-financial measures
include upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate Values (which include
customer satisfaction through superior quality and value, attractive investor
return, ethical business conduct, respecting the environment, and fostering
employee pride in the Company), management succession planning, and the general
overall perception of the Company by financial and business leaders.


                                       12



     No changes have been made to the fixed base salary portion of Mr.
DeSimone's compensation since January 1997. In November 1997, the Committee
afforded Mr. DeSimone the opportunity to receive an increase in total
compensation based on short-term performance of the Company by increasing the
units of cash profit sharing participation, effective January 1, 1998. Thus,
although per unit payments were less in 1998 than in 1997, the aggregate amount
of the profit sharing cash set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 1998
did increase over the amount earned in 1997. All other forms of variable,
performance-based compensation granted to Mr. DeSimone paid less in 1998 than
in 1997, based on the Company's performance.

DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the Company's ability
to deduct, for federal income tax purposes, certain compensation in excess of
$1 million per year paid to persons named in the Summary Compensation Table.
The Committee intends to ensure that all compensation paid to the executive
officers named in the Summary Compensation Table continues to meet the
deductibility requirements of Section 162(m) to the extent that such
requirements do not compromise the Company's ability to design effective
compensation plans that meet the Company's executive compensation objectives
described above.

CONCLUSION

     The Committee is satisfied that the short-term and long-term compensation
paid to the executive officers of the Company create alignment with the
Company's strategic objectives and ensure that payouts are driven by Company
performance and employee contribution to the Company.

*(Retired effective November 1, 1998)

(1) The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table do not include amounts
expensed for financial reporting purposes under the Company's pension plan. This
plan is a defined benefit plan. The amounts shown in the table do, however,
include those amounts voluntarily deferred by the named individuals under the
Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows
management personnel to defer portions of current base salary, profit sharing,
and performance unit compensation earned during the year.

(2) The amounts shown under the headings "Profit Sharing Cash (Bonus)" and
"Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock Awards)" are payments received under the
Profit Sharing Plan. The terms "(Bonus)" and "(Restricted Stock Awards)" are
included to satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). These payments are based upon the Company's performance and are
variable in accordance with a predetermined formula. The Compensation Committee
does not view these payments as bonus payments or restricted stock awards as
these terms are most often used. The Committee views bonus plans as plans which
provide for annual (as opposed to quarterly) payments from a pool rather than
based on a strict formula related to earnings per share. Restricted stock awards
are generally outright grants of stock as opposed to payment in the form of
stock held in the custody of the company (restricted period) in lieu of cash
under a formula-based profit sharing plan.

     Generally, profit sharing is paid in cash; however, senior executive
management, as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive a portion of
their profit sharing in shares of the Company's common stock (see footnote 3 on
page 15).

     The Company's Profit Sharing Plan provides for quarterly payments based
upon net income after deducting an allowance for a predetermined ten percent
annual rate of return on stockholder equity and is determined by multiplying the
number of profit sharing units awarded to an individual by this quarterly net
income, after deduction, divided by the number of the outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock.


                                       14



     Because of the required minimum return on stockholder equity, profit
sharing tends to rise and fall relatively more sharply than changes in net
income.

     The number of profit sharing units awarded to the individuals named is
determined by the Compensation Committee and is intended to reflect the level of
responsibility of the respective individual. Profit-sharing payments are subject
to limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to base
salary. Approximately 15,300 employees currently participate in profit sharing,
including the six individuals in the Summary Compensation Table.

(3) The amount shown under the heading "Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock
Awards)" represents the portion of profit sharing issued as common stock to the
named individuals, valued at 100 percent of the fair market value of the
Company's common stock at the end of the quarterly profit sharing performance
period. The number of shares is determined by the Company's quarterly net
income performance. However, payment is deferred and conditional upon continued
employment by the Company. Therefore, pursuant to SEC rules, it is included
under the headings of "Long-Term Compensation."

     The shares are held in the custody of the Company for a period of three
years or until age 65, whichever occurs first. Any termination of employment,
prior to that time, without the consent of the Compensation Committee or the
Board of Directors, other than upon death or permanent disability, will result
in forfeiture of the Profit Sharing Stock. The recipient is entitled to receive
dividends and vote these shares in the same manner as any other holder of the
Company's common stock during the period of custody by the Company. In 1998,
the Company distributed a portion of these shares to Messrs. DeSimone, Mitsch,
Agostini, Meredith, Baukol, and Kiester.

     From the time of issuance throughout the Restricted Period, Profit Sharing
Stock rises or falls in value in direct relationship to the Company's common
stock market performance. Consequently, Profit Sharing Stock reflects both
short-term and long-term performance elements.

     The named individuals have accumulated as of December 31, 1998, in one
case over ten years, the following shares of the Company's common stock under
the Company's Profit Sharing Plan. The Profit Sharing Stock is valued in this
table at the fair market value of such stock on December 31, 1998, and also on
the respective dates when the shares were issued into the custody of the
Company:

(4) "Other Annual Compensation" includes the following, to the extent that the
aggregate thereof exceeds $50,000: personal benefits received by the named
individuals, amounts reimbursed to the individuals during the year for payment
of taxes, and that portion of interest above market rates (as determined by the
SEC) paid on that compensation voluntarily deferred by the individuals. The
personal benefits included in these numbers represent the amount of personal
financial planning services, an amount paid on behalf of the individual for the
term portion of insurance under the Company's Senior Executive Split Dollar
Plan, and air travel on corporate aircraft imputed to the individual as income
for tax purposes. In the case of Mr. DeSimone, nearly all of the "Other Annual
Compensation" received in 1998, 1997, and 1996 was a result of income imputed
to him for travel.

(5) The number of stock options shown in this column includes both annual
grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and Progressive Stock
Options, which are described more fully in footnote 1 on page 17. The number
and price of all outstanding options were adjusted at the spin-off of Imation
Corp. in order to preserve the intrinsic value of the options. The number of
stock options shown in this column for 1998 reflects this adjustment.


                                       15



(6) "Performance Unit Plan (LTIP) Payouts" reflects the value of the total
grant for each individual under the Company's Performance Unit Plan after the
three-year performance period (e.g., the payout earned in 1998 covers the
performance period from 1996-1998). Under the 1998 award, the payout will be
paid to these individuals in 2001, unless the participant elects to defer the
payout for three additional years. The numbers shown represent estimates based
upon information available as of February 26, 1999. More specific information
about the Performance Unit Plan is set forth on pages 11 and 19.

(7) "All Other Compensation" includes: (a) that amount of Performance Unit Plan
earnings allocated during the year to the base amounts determined after the
three-year performance periods of each respective grant, to the extent that
such earnings are in excess of market interest rates (as determined by the
SEC); (b) that amount deemed to be compensation to the individuals under the
Company's Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan in accordance with rules developed
by the SEC; and (c) all amounts contributed to the account of each named
executive under the Company's 401(k) plan. The Senior Executive Split Dollar
Plan provides insurance to all of the Company's executive officers under split
dollar life insurance, which is partly term insurance and partly whole life
insurance with a cash value. Under this Plan, the Company is reimbursed for the
premium costs of the non-term portion of coverage and a possible return when
the arrangement terminates either by insurance proceeds incident to the death
of the individual or by cash value after 15 years of participation in the Plan.
During 1998, amounts deemed compensation under the Plan to the named executive
officers in the Summary Compensation Table were $6,682 for Mr. DeSimone;
$11,276 for Dr. Mitsch; $13,616 for Mr. Baukol; $8,374 for Mr. Agostini;
$12,905 for Mr. Meredith; and $14,873 for Mr. Kiester. These amounts were
determined by treating the non-term portion of the coverage as an interest-free
loan.

(1) The Company has not granted any stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), except
in limited circumstances to employees of certain subsidiaries who are not
subject to the tax laws of the United States where SARs have less onerous tax
consequences than stock options. The options shown for each individual include
both annual grants of Incentive Stock Options and nonqualified stock options
and grants of Progressive Stock Options ("PSO"). Nonqualified options are
subject to a reload feature when exercised with the payment of the option price
in the form of previously owned shares of the Company's common stock. Such an
exercise results in further grants of PSOs. The first grant shown for each
individual is the annual grant. The remaining lines are PSOs. The PSO grants
for each individual were made on a single date, but are, pursuant to SEC rules,
shown in multiple lines because of different expiration dates.

     PSO grants were made to participants who exercised nonqualified stock
options and who paid the purchase price using shares of previously owned
Company common stock. The PSO grant is for the number of shares equal to the
shares utilized in payment of the purchase price and tax withholding, if any.
The option price for the PSO is equal to 100 percent of the market value of the
Company's common stock on the date of the exercise of the primary option or,
alternatively, on the date of the PSO


                                       17



grant to the six named individuals in the table, all of whom are subject to the
requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The option period
is equal to the remaining period of the options exercised.

     The participant must have owned Company common stock used for payment for
at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified options per
participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO grants by the Committee.

     The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of nonqualified stock
options, without foregoing the opportunity for further appreciation, and
promotes retention of the Company stock acquired.

     In any event, a participant receiving an annual grant of nonqualified
stock options can never acquire more shares of Company common stock through
successive exercises of the initial and subsequent PSO grants than the number
of shares covered by the initial annual grant from the Committee.

(2) All options granted during the period were granted at the market value on
the date of grant if initial grants, or at the fair market values discussed in
footnote 1 above in the case of Progressive Stock Options, as calculated from
the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index. The option price shown for the "All Optionees" line is $92.78
and represents the weighted average exercise price of the options granted in
1998.

(3) The expiration date for the "All Optionees" line is shown as May 12, 2008,
since that is the applicable date for the vast majority of options granted
during 1998.

(4) Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, the Company has elected to provide a
grant date present value for these option grants determined by a modified
Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company's use of this model should not be
construed as an endorsement of its accuracy at valuing options. All stock
option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require a
prediction about the future movement of the stock price. Among key assumptions
utilized in this pricing model were: (i) that the time of exercise of stock
options would be 69 months (26 months for PSOs) into the term of the option,
which could be for terms as long as ten years, in recognition of the historical
exercise patterns at the Company for these types of options; (ii) expected
volatility of 17.6 percent (24 percent for PSOs); (iii) risk-free rate of
return of 5.7 percent (5.1 percent for PSOs); and (iv) dividend growth rate of
5.8 percent. No adjustments for non-transferability or risk of forfeiture have
been made. The Company expresses no opinion that the present value will, in
fact, be realized and expressly disclaims any representation to that effect.

(1) The "Value Realized" or the unrealized "Value of Unexercised In-the-Money
Options at FY-End" represents the aggregate difference between the market value
on the date of exercise or at December 31, 1998, in the case of the unrealized
values, and the applicable exercise prices. These


                                       18



differences accumulate over what may be, in many cases, several years. These
stock options all have option periods of ten years when first granted, and
Progressive Stock Options have option periods equal to the remaining option
period of the initial nonqualified options resulting in Progressive Stock
Options.

(1) The Company's Performance Unit Plan provides long-term compensation to 94
key management personnel based upon the Company's attainment of long-term
performance and growth criteria.

     The Compensation Committee, of which none of the members are current
employees of the Company, administers the Plan. The Committee has sole
discretion in the selection of participants, performance criteria, size of
awards, performance period, and the timing and form of payment, as well as all
other conditions regarding awards.

     Awards made in 1998 under the Amended Performance Unit Plan are based on
performance criteria that focus management attention on two key factors that
create shareholder value: Real Growth and Economic Profit. The payout can vary
from $0 to $200 per unit. The payout can be reached by either performance
criteria alone, or by both in combination. The payout may be deferred by the
participant for three additional years and earn interest at a specified rate.
No amount will be payable under the Amended Performance Unit Plan if the
Company's Real Growth is less than the Big 7 IPI and if Economic Profit is less
than 75 percent of the Economic Profit of the previous three years. More detail
about current performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee
Report on page 11.

     Payment is contingent upon continued employment to the payment date or
earlier retirement under the Company's pension plan. Participants receiving
awards during 1998, including the six executive officers in the Summary
Compensation Table, will receive payment in 2001, provided that such
individuals continue employment with the Company until such payment date
(except in the event of death, retirement, or disability). Payment under the
Plan may be made in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or any
combination of cash and stock, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.
In the past, payment has been made only in cash.

(2) The value of awards granted for 1998 will be determined by the Company's
attainment of Real Growth and Economic Profit performance criteria during a
three-year performance period of 1998, 1999, and 2000. More detail about
current performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report on
page 11. At the beginning of every performance period, participants may elect
to defer the payout for three years (for the 1998 award, the payout will be
made the beginning of 2003). Participants will earn interest during the
deferral period. The deferred amount will be subject to forfeiture if the
participant discontinues employment for any reason other than death,
disability, or retirement.


                                       19



(3) The estimated future payouts do not include any interest factor that would
be earned annually during the optional three-year deferral period following the
performance period. Interest during the optional three-year deferral period
would accrue annually at a rate equal to the annualized yield to maturity of a
five-year Treasury note as of the last business day of the preceding year (for
1997, that rate was 6.2 percent) plus an amount based on the Company's Economic
Profit for the preceding year as a percentage of the average operating capital
(for 1997, that rate was 6.6 percent). The interest would be payable, together
with the base award, in 2003.

(1) Earnings include base salary, profit sharing cash, and the value of Profit
Sharing Stock (at the time of award) actually earned by the participant and
does not include any other forms of remuneration. The benefits are computed on
the basis of straight-life annuity amounts and are not subject to any deduction
for Social Security or other offset amounts.

(2) To provide for the retirement security of its employees, the Company has
defined benefit pension plans for U.S. employees. These plans are fully paid by
the Company, and employees become vested after five years of service. Under the
plans, a participant may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62
for employees born after 1942) and if the participant's age and years of
service total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942) he or she
would receive a Social Security bridge to age 62. The six individuals listed in
the Summary Compensation Table are presently entitled to the respective years
of service credit set opposite their names:

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following compares the Company's cumulative and annualized total
shareholder return, overall stock market performance with reinvested
dividends*, during the five fiscal years preceding December 31, 1998, against
the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
both of which are well-known and published industry indices. The Company is
included in both the S&P 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial group of
30 companies. The Company, as a highly diversified manufacturer and seller of a
broad line of products, is not easily categorized with other, more specific,
industry indices.

     The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based
on the assumption that $100 had been invested in the Company's stock and each
index on December 31, 1993 (as required by SEC rules), and that all quarterly
dividends were reinvested at the average of the closing stock prices at the
beginning and end of the quarter. The total cumulative dollar returns shown on
the graph represents the value that such investments would have had on December
31, 1998.

     *The Company's interest in Imation Corp. was distributed to stockholders
as a special stock dividend payable in shares of Imation Corp. stock on July
15, 1996. The following graph accounts for this distribution as though it was
paid in cash and reinvested in common shares of the Company.

TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT

     During 1998, ten executive officers had loans outstanding with the Eastern
Heights Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. These loans were made in the
ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other persons of comparable circumstances and did not involve
more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require disclosure of
late Section 16 filings by 3M directors and executive officers. Company staff
responsible for Section 16 reporting was one week late in filing Form 4 for
transactions by Messrs. Baukol, Kiester, Meredith, and Mitsch in which
previously owned stock was used as the method of paying for the exercise of
options under the Management Stock Ownership Program.

ITEM 2. RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Audit Committee recommended and the Board of Directors appointed the
firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditors, to audit the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the
year 1999. In accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, this appointment is
being presented to the stockholders for ratification. If the stockholders do
not ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Board of Directors
will reconsider the selection.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (and its predecessor firm Coopers & Lybrand
L.L.P.) has audited the Company's consolidated financial statements since 1975.
The firm has offices and affiliates in most localities throughout the world
where the Company has operations. Audit services provided by the firm in 1998
included: audit of consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries; limited reviews of interim reports; reviews of filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission; consultations on matters related to
accounting and financial reporting; audits of statutory financial statements
for certain foreign subsidiaries; and audits of the financial statements of the
Company's benefit plans.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provided a number of nonaudit services
during 1998, all of which were approved or reviewed by the Audit Committee.

     A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is expected to be present
at the stockholders meeting and available to respond to appropriate questions
and will be given an opportunity to make a statement, if the representative
chooses to do so.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE
APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, TO AUDIT THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY FOR 1999. PROXIES SOLICITED BY
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED "FOR" RATIFICATION UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE
IS SPECIFIED.

ITEM 3. PROPOSED EXECUTIVE PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     The Executive Profit Sharing Plan has been the Company's basic
performance-based compensation plan since 1956. The Plan was last submitted to
stockholders at the Company's 1994 Annual Meeting and was approved by the
stockholders. The Compensation Committee proposes to change the performance
criteria from consolidated net income to economic profit. Economic profit is
defined as quarterly net operating income minus a capital charge and emphasizes
the effective use of working capital. The economic profit measurement is deemed
by the Committee to be related more directly to the creation of stockholder
value and will be more sensitive to performance of the Company. Thus, it is
expected that compensation paid under the new measurement will tend to rise and
fall relatively more sharply than payments under prior measurement criteria.
Although these changes to the performance criteria are already in effect under
the profit sharing plan for approximately 15,300 employees of the company in
the United States, the Executive Profit Sharing Plan is being submitted for
stockholder approval in order to maximize deductibility of compensation paid
under the Plan, pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.


                                       22



     Current payments under the existing profit sharing plan to the six most
highly compensated employees of the Company are set forth in the Summary
Compensation Table on page 14, under the columns captioned "Profit Sharing Cash
(Bonus)" and "Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock Awards)." More detail
about the existing plan is provided in footnotes 2 and 3 on pages 14-15.

     OBJECTIVE: The objective of the proposed plan is to provide a mechanism
whereby the most highly compensated employees will have a significant portion
of their total compensation measured by the quarterly economic profit of the
Company, and thus be motivated by the opportunity of the Company's overall
growth and success.

     PARTICIPATION AND ELIGIBILITY: Such executive officers of the Company as
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board will be eligible to
receive payments hereunder. It is anticipated that this would include the six
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table, except Dr. Mitsch
who retired from the Company on November 1, 1998.

     MANNER OF PAYMENT: Payment will be made on a quarterly basis in cash,
common stock, or a combination of cash and stock as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board. If payable in shares of the Company's
common stock, the shares of Profit Sharing Stock will be issued and granted
under the Company's 1997 Management Stock Ownership Program which was approved
by the Company's stockholders in 1997, or a similar successor plan approved by
stockholders.

     QUARTERLY GROSS PROFIT SHARING AMOUNT: The Compensation Committee, or a
subcommittee comprised of at least two of its members, will determine the
manner and method of determining the conversion of short-term performance by
the Company into compensation to be paid to participants, with the
understanding that such compensation shall be based upon the number of shares
of profit sharing assigned to a participant, multiplied by the Quarterly Profit
Sharing Earnings Per Share, as defined in the Plan set forth in Exhibit A.

     DATE OF PAYMENT: Payment of cash amounts to participants will be made
within 60 days after the close of each calendar and fiscal quarter. Shares of
Profit Sharing Stock may be restricted by action of the Compensation Committee
and held for several years before payment.

     MAXIMUM PAYMENTS: The total paid under the Plan for the Company's five
most highly compensated executive officers will never exceed one-half percent
(0.5%) of the consolidated net income of the Company for any respective period,
and no individual participant will ever receive more than one-third (33 1/3%)
of this total Plan limit.

     TAXES: All cash compensation received by participants under the Plan will
constitute ordinary income in the year in which it is received. Profit Sharing
Stock placed into the Company's custody as Restricted Stock will not result in
the recognition of any income or gain until released from custody and delivered
to the executive management participant. Dividends paid on Profit Sharing Stock
during Company custody will, however, be taxed as ordinary income in the year
received.

     ADMINISTRATION: The Plan will be administered by the Compensation
Committee appointed by the Board of Directors from its outside directors, none
of whom is eligible for participation. The Committee is empowered to adopt
rules and regulations concerning the administration and interpretation of the
Plan, but the Committee will have no discretion with regard to the basic
criteria for determination of the Quarterly Gross Profit Sharing Amounts
discussed above and may not, in any event, alter the units or the amount
payable under the Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings Per Share formula after the
commencement of a quarterly performance period.

     PLAN AMENDMENT: The Board of Directors may at any time terminate or amend
the Plan, except that no amendment shall be made without prior approval of the
Company's stockholders which would (i) materially alter the method for
determination of the Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings Per Share, or (ii)
materially alter the maximum limits for individual participants.

     PLAN DURATION: The Plan is intended to be indefinite in duration, but may
be amended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors, subject to the
above stated conditions. The Plan shall continue until so terminated.


                                       23



     EFFECT OF VOTE: A favorable vote by the holders of a majority of the
Company's common stock present, or represented, and voting at the Annual
Meeting, at which a quorum is present is required to approve the Plan. In the
event that the Plan does not receive favorable majority vote, the result will
be that the short-term performance compensation presently paid to these most
highly compensated employees will not be deductible for federal income tax
purposes by the Company, to the extent that it, together with other nonexempt
compensation exceeds the amount provided by the statute. At that point, the
Compensation Committee or the Board as a whole may elect to forego the
deductibility or to restructure the compensation packages of these individuals
to attempt to maximize deductibility of the compensation paid to these most
highly compensated employees.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE
EXECUTIVE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL
BE VOTED "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE IS SPECIFIED.

OTHER MATTERS

     The enclosed proxy confers upon the person or persons entitled to vote the
shares represented thereby discretionary authority to vote such shares in
accordance with their best judgment with respect to all matters which may
properly come before the meeting in addition to the scheduled items of
business. It is intended that proxies solicited by the Board of Directors,
unless otherwise specified therein, will be voted in accordance with the
recommendations of the Board of Directors.

     The Management knows of no other matters that may properly be presented at
the Annual Meeting, but if other matters do properly come before the meeting,
it is intended that the persons named in the proxy will vote according to their
best judgment.

     Stockholders are encouraged to vote their proxy via the Internet or by
telephone as described in the enclosed voting instructions or date, sign, and
return the enclosed proxy in the enclosed envelope, to which no postage need be
affixed if mailed in the United States. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you
may revoke your proxy at that time and vote in person if you desire; otherwise,
your proxy will be voted for you.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2000 ANNUAL MEETING

     Any proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and
form of proxy under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for
the 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received no later than 5 p.m.
Central Time on November 26, 1999. Proposals must be in writing and sent via

Mining and Manufacturing Company, 3M Center, St. Paul, MN 55144. Proposals sent
by any other means, including facsimile or other forms of electronic
submissions, will not be accepted.

     Under the Company's Bylaws, if a shareholder wishes to nominate a director
or bring other business before the shareholders at the annual meeting, (i) the
shareholder's written notice must be received by the Secretary between January
12, 2000, and February 11, 2000, and (ii) the notice must contain the specific
information required in the Company's Bylaws. A copy of the Bylaws may be
obtained by writing to the Secretary. Please note that these requirements
relate only to matters a shareholder wishes to bring before the annual meeting.
They do not apply to proposals that a shareholder wishes to have included in
the Company's proxy statement.

By Order of the Board of Directors.

                                                                       EXHIBIT A


                    PROPOSED EXECUTIVE PROFIT SHARING PLAN

     1. DEFINITIONS.

     "Economic Profit." Economic Profit for the purpose of this Plan is defined
as the difference between the Quarterly Net Operating Income and the Quarterly
Capital Charge, as defined below.

     "Quarterly Net Operating Income." Net Operating Income for the purpose of
this Plan is defined as the consolidated operating income of the Company and
its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, reduced by a charge for taxes based on
the Company's effective tax rate.

     "Quarterly Capital Charge." The Quarterly Capital Charge will be
one-fourth of the Company's Cost of Capital multiplied by the amount of
Operating Capital as of the close of such calendar quarter.

     "Cost of Capital." The Cost of Capital is a weighted average of the
Company's cost of funding, including both equity and debt financing.

     "Operating Capital." Operating Capital for the purpose of this Plan is
defined as the total assets of the Company, reduced by the amount of any other
securities and the adjusted current liabilities (total current liabilities
minus short-term debt), and adjusted for any deferred taxes.

     "Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings Per Share." The quarterly Economic
Profit divided by the fixed number One Hundred Million (100,000,000) will
determine the Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings Per Share.

     "Quarterly Gross Profit Sharing Amount." The number of shares of profit
sharing assigned to an individual, multiplied by the Quarterly Profit Sharing
Earnings Per Share, will determine that individual's Quarterly Gross Profit
Sharing Amount.

     2. PARTICIPATION. Such executive officers of the Company as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") will be
eligible to receive payments under the Plan.

     3. YEAR-TO-DATE CALCULATION. At the close of each quarter following the
first quarter, the Quarterly Gross Profit Sharing Amount and the limits of full
profit sharing participation will be accumulated for the year-to-date for the
purpose of calculated individual profit sharing payments on a year-to-date
basis. The Profit Sharing Payment for the current quarter will be the
difference between the year-to-date amount and the sum of the Profit Sharing
Payments to the individual in the prior quarters of the calendar year.

     4. DATE OF PAYMENT. Profit Sharing Payments will be made within sixty days
after the close of each calendar quarter.

     5. MANNER OF PAYMENT. Profit Sharing Payments may be made in cash, common
stock, or a combination of cash and stock as determined by the Committee.

     6. MAXIMUM PAYMENTS. The total paid under this Plan for the Company's five
most highly compensated executive officers will never exceed one-half percent
(0.5%) of the consolidated net income of the Company for any respective period,
and no individual participant will ever receive more than one-third (33 1/3%) of
this total Plan limit.

     7. ADMINISTRATION. The Plan will be administered by the Committee, none of
whom shall be eligible to participate. The Committee is authorized to adopt
rules and policies concerning the administration and interpretation of the
Plan, but the Committee will have no discretion with regard to the basic
criteria for the determination of Quarterly Gross Profit Sharing Amounts and
may not, in any event, alter the units or the Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings
Per Share formula after the commencement of a quarterly performance period. If
required for compliance with legal or tax guidelines with regard to its role in
administering the Plan, the Committee may act through a subcommittee comprised
of at least two of its members, none of whom shall be eligible to participate
in the Plan.


                                       A-1



     8. PLAN AMENDMENT. The Board of Directors may at any time terminate or
amend the Plan, except that no amendment shall be made, without prior approval
by the Company's stockholders, which would (i) alter the method for
determination of the Quarterly Profit Sharing Earnings Per Share, or (ii)

TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN
AND THE 3M EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trusts established in
connection with the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") and the 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan (the "VIP"). As Trustee, it is the record owner of
the shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company ("3M")
held in the ESOP and the VIP for the benefit of participants. Since the portion
of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP") applicable to
union-free employees was merged into the ESOP during 1990, the shares of 3M
common stock held in the PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the ESOP
Trust.

The ESOP and the VIP each permit participants, as Named Fiduciaries, to direct
the respective Trustees how to vote the number of shares of 3M common stock
allocated to the participants' respective accounts. Additionally, as a Named
Fiduciary of the ESOP, you are entitled to direct the Trustee how to vote a
proportionate number of shares which have not been allocated to participants or
for which no voting directions have been received. The number of shares of 3M
common stock held in your individual accounts in the ESOP and the VIP are
indicated at the top of the enclosed proxy card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
11, 1999, and Proxy Statement, (2) instructions for giving voting directions to
the Trustee via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail through use of the
enclosed proxy card, and (3) a return envelope. The Trustee will vote, in
accordance with your directions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to
your respective accounts if you give voting directions by (i) the Internet as
described in the enclosed voting instructions, (ii) telephone as described in
the enclosed voting instructions or (iii) completing the enclosed proxy card
and returning it in the enclosed return envelope so that it is received no
later than May 6, 1999 by Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation
agent for the Trustee.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held
in the ESOP and VIP accounts. The ability to direct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

Internet or telephone voting instructions must be properly followed or the
enclosed proxy card must be properly completed if voting directions are to be
honored. If the Internet or telephone voting instructions are not followed or
if the card is not received by May 6, 1999, or if the voting directions are
invalid, the shares held in your ESOP accounts will be voted by State Street
Bank and Trust Company in the same proportion that the other participants in
the ESOP direct the Trustee to vote the shares held in their ESOP accounts, and
the shares held in your VIP account shall be voted by State Street Bank and
Trust Company as directed by the Public Issues Committee of the 3M Board of
Directors.

Please provide voting directions to the Trustee via the Internet or by
telephone in accordance with the enclosed voting instructions, or complete,
date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed proxy card.

TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M SAVINGS PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trust established in
connection with the 3M Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"). As Trustee, it is the
record owner of the shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Company ("3M") held in the Savings Plan for the benefit of
participants. Since the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock
Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP") applicable to employees eligible to participate in
the Savings Plan was merged into the Savings Plan during 1993, the shares of 3M
common stock held in the PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the Savings
Plan.

The Savings Plan permits participants to direct the Trustee how to vote the
number of shares of 3M common stock allocated to the participants' respective
accounts. The number of shares of 3M common stock held in your individual
account in the Savings Plan are indicated at the top of the enclosed proxy
card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
11, 1999, and Proxy Statement, (2) instructions for giving voting directions to
the Trustee via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail through use of the
enclosed proxy card, and (3) a return envelope. The Trustee will vote, in
accordance with your directions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to
your account if you give voting directions by (i) the Internet as described in
the enclosed voting instructions, (ii) telephone as described in the enclosed
voting instructions or (iii) completing the enclosed proxy card and returning
it in the enclosed envelope so that it is received no later than May 6, 1999 by
Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for the Trustee.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held
in the Savings Plan accounts. The ability to direct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

Internet or telephone voting instructions must be properly followed or the
enclosed proxy card must be properly completed if voting directions are to be
honored. If the Internet or telephone voting instructions are not followed or
if the card is not received by May 6, 1999, or if the voting directions are
invalid, the shares held in your Savings Plan account shall be voted by State
Street Bank and Trust Company, as directed by the Public Issues Committee of
the 3M Board of Directors.

Please provide voting directions to the Trustee via the Internet or by
telephone in accordance with the enclosed voting instructions, or complete,
date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed proxy card.
