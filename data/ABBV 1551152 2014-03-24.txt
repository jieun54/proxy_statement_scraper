PROXY STATEMENT
 
   SOLICITATION OF PROXIES     
        The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The meeting will
be held on May 9, 2014, at the Rosewood, 2825 Sand Hill Road, Menlo Park, California 94025. 
 
 
  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING     
 
    Who Can Vote     
        Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2014 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual
Meeting. As of March 12, 2014, AbbVie had 1,596,050,177 outstanding shares of common stock, which are AbbVie's only outstanding voting securities. Each stockholder has one vote per share.
Stockholders do not have the right to vote cumulatively in electing directors. 
 
 
  Notice and Access     
        In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's e-proxy rules, AbbVie mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials (the "Notice") to stockholders in March 2014. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how stockholders can access the proxy materials online. It also
provides instructions on how stockholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a printed version of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you would like to
receive a printed version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
 
 
  Voting by Proxy     
        AbbVie's stockholders may vote their shares by telephone, the Internet, or at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by telephone or the
Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found on the Notice, on the website listed in the Notice, and, if you received one, on your proxy card. If you
requested a printed version of the proxy card, you may also vote by mail. 
 
 
  Revoking a Proxy     
        You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the
meeting:


by delivering a written notice to the secretary of AbbVie, 
by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 

 
 
  Discretionary Voting Authority     
        Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares of
AbbVie common stock covered by proxies they receive to elect the 3 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a
substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 3 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. 
        Where
a stockholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm
or the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, the shares of AbbVie common stock represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been
specified, the proxy will be voted 



 
Table of Contents
FOR
the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors and FOR the approval of executive compensation. 
        The
board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy
will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
 
 
  Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy     
        A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, represented in person or by proxy,
constitutes a quorum. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the stockholders with respect to that matter. 
 
 
  Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions     
        A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that
all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those
shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters,
although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote shares in the absence of instructions on matters the New
York Stock Exchange considers "routine," such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on
"non-routine" matters. The election of directors and the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation are considered "non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the
determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies that are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain
from voting on that matter, other than the election of directors, will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
 
 
  Inspectors of Election     
        The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify stockholders are
independent and are not AbbVie employees. 
 
 
  Cost of Soliciting Proxies     
        AbbVie will bear the cost of making solicitations from its stockholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of AbbVie and its subsidiaries. 
        AbbVie
has retained Georgeson Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
 
  AbbVie Savings Plan     
        Participants in the AbbVie Savings Plan will receive a voting instruction card for their shares of AbbVie common stock held in the
AbbVie Savings Plan Trust. The Trust is administered by both a trustee and an investment committee. The trustee is Mercer Trust Company. The members of the investment committee are Amarendra Duvvur,
William H.S. Preece and Michael J. Thomas, employees of AbbVie. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the investment

Table of Contents
committee
and the participants. The investment committee must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The investment committee may use its own
discretion with respect to those shares of AbbVie common stock for which no voting instructions are received. 
 
 
  SEPARATION OF ABBVIE FROM ABBOTT LABORATORIES     
        On January 1, 2013, AbbVie became an independent company as a result of the distribution by Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") of
100% of the outstanding common stock of AbbVie to Abbott's shareholders (the "Separation"). Each Abbott shareholder of record as of the close of business on December 12, 2012 (the "Record
Date") received one share of AbbVie common stock for each Abbott common share held as of the Record Date. AbbVie was incorporated in Delaware on April 10, 2012 and is comprised of Abbott's
former research-based pharmaceuticals business. AbbVie's Registration Statement on Form 10 was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC" or the "Securities and
Exchange Commission") on December 7, 2012. AbbVie's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "ABBV" on the New York Stock Exchange on January 2, 2013. For
additional information, please see AbbVie's Information Statement, which is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to AbbVie's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 2, 2013. 
 
 
  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATERIALS     
        AbbVie's corporate governance guidelines with the outline of directorship qualifications; director independence guidelines; code of
business conduct; and audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee charters are all available in the corporate governance section of
AbbVie's investor relations website at www.abbvieinvestor.com.

  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES     
 
    The Board of Directors     
        The board of directors held eleven meetings in 2013. The average attendance of all incumbent directors at board and committee meetings
in 2013 was ninety-eight percent and each director attended at least seventy-five percent of the total number of board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. AbbVie
encourages its board members to attend the annual stockholder meeting. All of AbbVie's directors attended the 2013 annual stockholder meeting. 
        The
board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: Dr. Alpern, Ms. Austin,
Mr. Burnside, Mr. Liddy, Mr. Rapp, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Tilton, and Mr. Waddell. To determine independence, the board applied the AbbVie Inc. director
independence guidelines. The board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with AbbVie or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship
that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which AbbVie sold products or
made contributions or from which AbbVie purchased products and services during the year. This also included consideration of the fact that some of the directors serve on the board of Abbott, AbbVie's
former parent. In making its determination, the board relied on both information provided by the directors and information developed internally by AbbVie. 
        The
board has risk oversight responsibility for AbbVie and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. The board has determined that the
current leadership structure, in which the offices of chairman of the board and chief executive officer are held by one individual and the chair of the nominations and governance committee is
appointed to be the lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best
interests of AbbVie and its stockholders. The lead director facilitates communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions
where the chairman of the board is not present. It is the role of the lead director to review and approve matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information
provided to other board members. The lead director is chosen by and from the independent members of the board of directors, and serves as the liaison between the chairman of the board and the
independent directors; however, all directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chairman on each of the above topics, as well. The lead director, and each of the other directors,
communicates regularly with the chairman of the board and chief executive officer regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters. The lead director also has the authority to call
meetings of the independent directors and, if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication. 
        AbbVie
directors have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that serve AbbVie's governance and strategic needs. Director nominees are considered
on the basis of a range of criteria including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business
perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. They must have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board's oversight role with respect to AbbVie's business and
affairs. Each director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the board to conclude that the director should serve on the board. The directors' biographies are in
the section of this proxy statement captioned "Information Concerning Director Nominees."

  Committees of the Board of Directors     
        The board of directors has five committees established in AbbVie's By-Laws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation
committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee. Each of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public
policy committee is independent. 
        The
executive committee members are Mr. Gonzalez, chair, Ms. Austin, Mr. Liddy, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Tilton. This committee may exercise all the
authority of the board in the management of AbbVie, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
        The
audit committee members are Ms. Austin, chair, Mr. Burnside, Mr. Rapp, and Mr. Waddell. The committee is governed by a written charter. This committee
assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to AbbVie's accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process, the quality and integrity of
AbbVie's financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance, the performance of AbbVie's internal audit function and internal auditors, certain areas of
legal and regulatory compliance, and enterprise risk management. Each of the members of the audit committee is financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock
Exchange, and the independence requirements set forth in Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The board of directors has determined that
Ms. Austin, the committee's chair, is an "audit committee financial expert." 
        The
compensation committee members are Mr. Liddy, chair, Ms. Austin, Mr. Tilton, and Mr. Waddell. The committee is governed by a written charter. This
committee assists the board of directors in carrying out the board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of AbbVie's executive officers and directors. The compensation committee annually
reviews the compensation paid to the directors and gives its recommendations to the full board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that
compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director compensation, the compensation committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could
be viewed as indirect director compensation. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." This committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of AbbVie participates and all
of AbbVie's equity-based plans. It may delegate the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with
applicable law or regulations or with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The compensation committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain and/or terminate
independent compensation advisors. The compensation committee reviews and discusses with management and its independent compensation advisor potential risks associated with AbbVie's compensation
policies and practices as discussed in the section captioned
"Compensation Risk Assessment." Each member of the committee qualifies as a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and as an "outside director" for purposes
of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). 
        The
committee has an engagement with Aon Hewitt to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Aon Hewitt, and its principal, report directly
to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between meetings, and performs no other
services for AbbVie or its senior executives. The committee determines what variables it will instruct Aon Hewitt to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be
examined, financial metrics to be used to assess AbbVie's relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The
committee 
10



 
Table of Contents
negotiates
and approves any fees paid to Aon Hewitt for these services. In 2013, the compensation committee of AbbVie's board authorized payment of approximately $300,000 to Aon Hewitt for services
rendered to the compensation committee relating to executive compensation. Separately, AbbVie management engaged Aon Hewitt to perform and paid approximately $1.8 million for unrelated
services, including actuarial work, pension design and administration, insurance, and general consulting. The AbbVie compensation committee was informed about these services, but its formal approval
was not requested. Based on an assessment of internally developed information and information provided by Aon Hewitt, the compensation committee has determined that the committee's independent
compensation advisor does not have a conflict of interest. A copy of the compensation committee report is included in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Committee Report." 
        The
nominations and governance committee members are Mr. Tilton, chair, Dr. Alpern, Mr. Burnside, and Mr. Roberts. The committee is governed by a written
charter. This committee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become board members and recommends to the board the nominees for election as directors at the next
annual meeting of stockholders, recommends to the board the persons to be elected as executive officers of AbbVie, recommends to the board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to AbbVie,
oversees the evaluation of the board and management, and serves in an advisory capacity to the board and the chairman of the board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major
changes in the organizational structure of AbbVie, and the conduct of board activities. The process used by this committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the board of directors depends
on the qualities being sought. From time to time, AbbVie engages an executive search firm to assist the committee in identifying individuals qualified to be board members. Board members should have
backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve AbbVie's governance and strategic needs. In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of
the board of directors, the nominations and governance committee considers the board's diversity of ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that
diversity. Board candidates will be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary
fields of endeavor, as well as a global business
perspective, commitment to good corporate citizenship, and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the board. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability
that is relevant to the board of directors' oversight role with respect to AbbVie's business and affairs. 
        The
public policy committee members are Mr. Roberts, chair, Dr. Alpern, Mr. Liddy, and Mr. Rapp. The committee is governed by a written charter. This
committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to AbbVie's public policy, certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs
and health care compliance issues that affect AbbVie by discharging the responsibilities set forth in its charter. 
 
 
  COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS     
        Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the board of directors by writing a letter to the chairman of the board,
to the lead director, or to the independent directors c/o AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, AP34, North Chicago, Illinois 60064, Attention: corporate secretary. The corporate secretary
regularly forwards to the addressee all letters other than mass mailings, advertisements, and other materials not relevant to AbbVie's business. In addition, directors regularly receive a log of all
correspondence received by the company that is addressed to a member of the board and may request any correspondence on that log.

(1)Under
the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $10,500 for each month of service as a director and $1,000 for each month of
service as a chair of a board committee, other than the chair of the audit committee. The chair of the audit committee receives $1,500 for each month of service as a chair of that committee and the
other members of the audit committee receive $500 for each month of service as a committee member.  

Fees
earned under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair
value), deferred (as an unfunded AbbVie obligation), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by the director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's
grantor trust generally commences at the later of when the director reaches age 65 or upon retirement from the board of directors. The director may elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in a
trust and credited to a stock equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in AbbVie stock or to a guaranteed interest account. If necessary, AbbVie contributes funds to
a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related AbbVie common stock at year-end. 
(2)The
amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic
718. AbbVie determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one share of
AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. 

In
addition to the fees described in footnote (1), each non-employee director elected to or serving on the board of directors at the annual stockholder meeting receives under the AbbVie 2013 Incentive
Stock Program vested restricted stock units with a value of $113,000 (rounded down) (effective as of the 2014 annual meeting, this will increase to $143,000 (rounded down)). In 2013, this was 2,535
units. The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the units at the same rate as other stockholders. Upon termination or retirement from the
board, death, or a change in control of the company, a non-employee director 


12

will
receive one common share for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. 
The
following AbbVie restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2013: R. Alpern, 11,094; R. Austin, 18,757; W. Burnside, 2,535; E. Liddy, 6,521; E. Rapp, 2,535; R. Roberts,
2,535; G. Tilton, 14,741; F. Waddell, 2,535. These numbers include, where applicable, AbbVie restricted stock units issued when AbbVie separated from Abbott Laboratories on January 1, 2013. The
AbbVie awards resulted from an anti-dilution adjustment in accordance with terms of the Abbott awards designed to preserve the value of the Abbott awards, so the January 1, 2013 awards are not
included in the Director Compensation table. When AbbVie separated from Abbott, the directors and other holders of Abbott restricted stock units generally retained those awards and received restricted
stock units of AbbVie in an amount that reflected the distribution to Abbott shareholders. Such awards are subject to substantially the same terms, vesting conditions and other restrictions that
applied to the original Abbott awards immediately before the distribution.  


(3)No
AbbVie stock options were outstanding as of December 31, 2013.
(4)The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan during 2013.
(5)Charitable
contributions made by AbbVie's non-employee directors are eligible for a matching contribution (up to $25,000 annually). During 2013, AbbVie made
charitable matching contributions on behalf of the following AbbVie directors: W. Burnside, $12,500; E. Rapp, $25,000; R. Roberts, $25,000; G. Tilton, $25,000; F. Waddell, $25,000. This column also
includes reimbursement for certain taxes.

  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     
 
    Compensation Discussion and Analysis     
 
    Executive Summary     
        The Compensation Committee ("Committee") believes performance must always be evaluated compared to the goals of the business and
assessed in the context of market and business conditions. 
        2013
was a very successful year for AbbVie financially, operationally and in its pipeline development efforts. AbbVie's stock price performance in 2013 contributed to a
60.7 percent annual total stockholder return, compared to 29.7 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 32.4 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index over the
same time period. 
        AbbVie
achieved sales of $18.8 billion in 2013, up nearly 3 percent globally, excluding roughly 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Sales growth was
driven by double-digit growth from HUMIRA, Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa, and was achieved despite the loss of exclusivity and generic competition in the lipid franchise. AbbVie exceeded its original
EPS guidance range, demonstrating the strength of the company's business. 
        In
addition to achieving its financial goals, AbbVie completed a successful transition to operating as an independent company, and delivered operational efficiencies and improvements in
gross margin. Further, AbbVie continued to execute on its commercial, regulatory and clinical objectives, including completion of its Phase III interferon-free HCV program for genotype one
patients. AbbVie also made significant additional progress in advancing its pipeline, including: initiation of a large, global Phase III registrational study of Atrasentan for the treatment of
diabetic kidney disease; initiation of a second registrational study of Elagolix for the treatment of endometriosis; and initiation of a large, Phase II, potentially registrational trial of
ABT-199 in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with the 17P deletion. AbbVie also expanded its pipeline through partnering activities, adding two new assets to its mid-stage
immunology pipeline, expanding an existing partnership to include an additional indication and entering into a global alliance to discover and develop novel therapies for cystic fibrosis.

        This
Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes the pay philosophy established for the company's named executive officers, the design of our compensation programs, the
process used to examine performance in the context of executive pay decisions, and the performance goals and results for each named executive officer:

        Although
we describe our programs in the context of the named executive officers, it is important to note that our programs generally have broad eligibility and therefore in most cases
apply to employee populations outside the named executive officer group as well. 
 
 
  Compensation Philosophy and Components of Pay     
        AbbVie has established a compensation philosophy that aligns named executive officers' interests with both short- and long-term
profitable growth and stockholder returns, and is designed to attract and retain named executive officers whose talent and contributions sustain this growth. The intent of this philosophy is to
directly support achievement of the company's primary business strategies and goals, while also aligning named executive officers' performance and rewards with stockholders' interests. Consequently,
the Committee believes the vast majority of named executive officer compensation at AbbVie should be, and by definition is, performance-based. AbbVie and the Committee will continue to consider and
develop AbbVie's compensation structure, design, practices and procedures to effectively meet the company's business needs and goals. 
        Four
primary pay components make up AbbVie's executive pay program: base pay, short-term incentives, long-term incentives and benefits. Each component serves complementary, but different
and specific, purposes. 
 Base Pay  
        Setting appropriate levels of base pay ensures AbbVie can attract and retain a leadership team that will continue to meet our
commitments to customers and patients and sustain profitable growth for our stockholders. Adjustments to base pay may be made from time to time by the Committee to reflect factors such as performance,
level of responsibility and market data for similar positions at comparable peer companies. Talented executives have choices of where they work, and our base pay rates therefore need to be competitive
in the context of total compensation. 
 Short-Term Incentives  
        AbbVie's short-term incentive structure is intended to align named executive officers' interests directly with AbbVie's annual
operating strategies, financial goals and leadership behaviors. It provides a direct link between named executive officers' short-term incentives and the company's annual performance results through
both measurable financial and operational performance and subjective assessments of strategic progress and leadership behaviors. Some goals, strategies and leadership behaviors may apply to all named
executive officers and, as such, may be corporate priorities that are 
17



 
Table of Contents
shared
by all named executive officers in any given year. Measurable goals apply to all named executive officers, reflecting their specific areas of responsibility. 
        Most
named executive officers also carry strategic and leadership-oriented goals, which require qualitative, subjective assessment of their progress during the year. Finally, the process
allows for Committee discretion, since many goals, especially for certain positions, cannot be reduced to formulaic, numerical targets, or anticipated in advance. By definition, therefore, short-term
incentives directly tie named executive officers' pay to both Company and individual results, allowing for Committee discretion to address unforeseen developments. In the aggregate, short-term
incentives should be paid roughly at target when results substantially meet expectations, below target if results do not substantially meet expectations, and above target if results substantially
exceed expectations. 
 Long-Term Incentives  
        AbbVie's long-term incentives serve two primary purposes: first, they directly align the largest component of named executive officer
pay with stockholders' interests; and second, they help ensure successful long-term performance through effective focus and retention of executive talent. 
        Named
executive officers' interests are directly aligned with those of stockholders in two ways. First, through direct stock ownership, named executive officers benefit from the results
they create for other stockholders. Second, the levels of awards named executive officers receive vary, by plan design and each named executive officer's individual performance, as reviewed by the
Committee. The Committee considers various measures it believes align with an increase in stockholder returns, or with operating and strategic results that help drive stockholder value creation.
Awards are further differentiated based on each named executive officer's leadership and specific contribution to long-term strategic results. Accordingly, there is a compelling and direct link
between named executive officers' long-term incentives and Company results and stockholder return. 
        Effective
focus and retention of executive talent are a result of the emphasis placed on long-term incentives within the broader rewards framework. In 2013, long-term incentives
comprised roughly two-thirds of total compensation for AbbVie's named executive officers. 
        For
awards in 2013, AbbVie granted non-qualified stock options and performance-vesting restricted shares to named executive officers. All awards were granted under the AbbVie 2013
Incentive Stock Program. 
 Benefits  
        As with all AbbVie employees, named executive officers are provided certain employment and post-employment benefits. Benefits are an
important part of retention and capital preservation for all employees, helping to protect against the impact of unexpected catastrophic loss of health and/or earnings potential, as well as providing
a means to save and accumulate for retirement or other post-employment needs. 
 
 
  Say-on-Pay and Say-on-Frequency Vote     
        The Committee annually evaluates the Company's compensation policies and programs to ensure alignment with short- and long-term
interests of our stockholders, evolving market practices and other relevant factors. The Committee considers whether the performance criteria and corresponding objectives appropriately balance
objective performance and the quality of that performance, the relationship between performance and incentive plan payouts, the mix of short- and long-term incentives, and whether the overall
structure and application of the incentive plans encourages appropriate behavior. 
18



 
Table of Contents
        The
Committee also considers the perspectives of stockholders through the Say-on-Pay advisory vote. In May 2013, stockholders expressed support for AbbVie's Say-on-Pay proposal with
95.7% of votes cast in favor of the compensation paid to the named executive officers. We consider this vote a positive endorsement of our executive compensation practices and decisions. Despite this
positive result, the Committee, its independent compensation consultant and management continue to examine our compensation practices in light of competitive practices and will make changes the
Committee believes are appropriate. In addition, we routinely engage with our investors to understand their perspectives on their investment in AbbVie, including our executive compensation practices.
All of these factors are important in determining whether the company's compensation programs are appropriately balanced
between defining and incentivizing performance, encouraging appropriate behavior, and retaining executive talent. In the aggregate, they strongly align our compensation policies and programs with our
stockholders' best interests. 
        The
Committee also recommended, and the board of directors adopted, an annual advisory vote of stockholders on executive compensation, which reflects the preference expressed by
stockholders in 2013 with respect to the frequency of the Say-on-Pay vote. 
 
 
  How Executive Pay Decisions Are Made     
        The vast majority of pay decisions at AbbVie are performance-based. Specific goals and targets are the foundation of our
pay-for-performance process and this section describes how they apply to each pay component. It is important to note, however, that while our pay process is based on a comprehensive, multi-level
review, it is not entirely formulaic. Some goals can be measured objectively against pre-determined financial results. Others take the form of the Committee's subjective assessment of success and
progress against strategic objectives or leadership behaviors, which cannot be scored by numeric or formulaic application of measurable criteria. Consequently, while final pay decisions are guided by
some specific, objective measures, the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, also considers, at both the company and individual levels, a combination of objective
and subjective measures in the overall assessment of performance and the pay decisions that result from that assessment. Discussion of the decision-making criteria for each pay component follows. 
 Peer Group  
        To provide the appropriate context for executive pay decisions for 2013, the Committee, in consultation with its independent
compensation consultant, assessed market practices and pay levels of two designated groups of comparable companies. In addition to competing for executive talent, the peer companies also operate
complex business operations with significant global reach. The comparison groups for setting targets for compensation for 2013 were as follows:

Table of Contents
        Constituents
of the Health Care Companies group generally are AbbVie's competitors for business and executive talent, and are companies the Committee believes represent our competitive
market. Generally, constituents of the High-Performing Companies group have a five-year average return on equity of 18% or higher and are similar to AbbVie in terms of size, performance and/or scope
of global operations. While the Committee expects to review these groups over time, it believes the peer groups described above are currently appropriate for making executive pay comparisons. 
 Base Pay  
        Base pay must be competitive with the market from which our talent is obtained. Generally, base pay is established in a manner that
references the median of the Health Care Companies group as an initial benchmark, but may be adjusted upon secondary reference to the High-Performing Companies group. Specific pay rates, however, are
based on a named executive officer's profile, performance, experience, unique skills and internal equity with others at AbbVie. Once the rate of pay is set in this manner either at hire or upon
promotion or transfer, subsequent changes in pay, including salary increases, when appropriate, are based on the named executive officer's performance, the job he or she is performing, internal equity
and the company's operating budget. In this sense, base pay is performance-based as well as aligned with the individual's relative skills, experience and contributions. 
 Short-Term Incentives  
        In 2013, AbbVie's named executive officers participated in the AbbVie 2013 Performance Incentive Plan ("PIP"). The PIP is intended to
comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation. 
        Each
year, the Committee establishes maximum award allocations for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2013, the maximum award was .0015 of fiscal year-end
adjusted consolidated net earnings for the Chief Executive Officer and .00075 of fiscal year-end adjusted consolidated net earnings for all of the other named executive officers. In 2013, the
Committee exercised its discretion to deliver PIP awards that were below the maximum awards that are authorized in the plan. 
        Assessments
of performance against financial results consider the impact of specified adjustments or events, and the appropriateness of these adjustments is reviewed annually. In 2013,
specified adjustments consisted of intangible asset amortization, separation costs, acquired in process research and development, and costs related to restructuring activities, as described in
Exhibit 99.1 to AbbVie's Form 8-K filed on January 31, 2014. 
        In
making its determination regarding the actual award to all participants, the Committee considered pre-determined financial goals, individual goals and other strategic or leadership
goals whose subjective assessment was not solely dictated by numeric or formulaic applications of measurable criteria. Moreover, while each participant had predetermined goals, the Committee also
considered relative achievements or developments (in the company, marketplace and the global economy) that could not have been foreseen when individual goals were established. 
        Goals
specific to each named executive officer are described below. 
 Long-Term Incentives  
        Long-term incentive targets are driven by two primary factors: first, the performance of each named executive officer and his or her
relative contribution to the company's long-term success; and second, the company's short- and long-term returns to stockholders, as well as relative performance against financial and/or operating
measures that drive stockholder returns, and performance against strategic objectives. Starting with the independent compensation consultant's recommendations 
20



 
Table of Contents
regarding
target or reference levels of appropriate long-term incentives by individual, the Committee determines grants for each named executive officer based on its objective and subjective
assessment of performance, and progress against strategic milestones, as well as external factors which may have affected the individual's and/or company's performance. 
        It
is important to note that while the Committee may target pay levels for a group of named executive officers or a specific named executive officer at, higher than, or below a certain
performance percentile that the independent compensation consultant may forecast, the actual awards are made without knowledge of the actual long-term incentive awards of competitors for the current
performance period because some elements of competitors' actual performance and their actual compensation awards for the current performance period are unknown at the time of award. The independent
compensation consultant's long-term incentive information always reflects prior performance periods, so it is impossible at the time of the award determination to predict precisely where actual pay
decisions will place AbbVie's named executive officers relative to others. 
        Awards
for 2013 were based on the goals of AbbVie's long-term incentive program, the Committee's assessment of business performance, each individual's relative performance against his or
her pre-determined goals, current outstanding awards held by the named executive officers and the recommendation of the independent compensation consultant to the Committee. After contemplating these
factors, the Committee delivered long-term incentive awards to the named executive officers that were intended, in the aggregate, to reward for performance between the median and the
75th percentile of the Health Care Companies group. 
        Applying
these standards, the Committee determined the equity award value for each named executive officer and made the awards reported in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "2013
Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table. Further, AbbVie determined in 2013, based on market practice, advice from the Committee's independent compensation consultant and recommendations of institutional
stockholders, that the long-term incentive awards for named executive officers should be in the form of 25 percent stock options and 75 percent performance-vesting shares. 
        AbbVie's
policy with respect to its annual equity award for all eligible employees, including the named executive officers, is to grant the award and set the grant price at the same time
each year, at the Committee's regularly scheduled February meeting. These meeting dates generally are the third Thursday of February and are scheduled two years in advance. 
        AbbVie's
2013 annual grant was dated and the grant price set on February 14, 2013. AbbVie's practice for setting the grant price is the average of the highest and lowest trading
prices of a common share on the date of the grant (rounded up to the next even penny). The grant price for the 2013 annual grant was set at $35.88. The high, low and closing prices of an AbbVie common
share on February 14, 2013 were $36.73, $35.01 and $36.57, respectively. 
        In
establishing criteria for performance-vesting shares, the Committee considers the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant, and the fact that the secondary comparison
of the High-Performing Companies group is generally defined by five-year average return on equity of 18 percent or greater. 
        Accordingly,
performance-vesting shares granted in 2013 may vest over a period of up to five years, with not more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year, dependent upon the
company achieving an annual return on equity threshold of 18 percent from continuing operations adjusted for specified items as described in the quarterly earnings releases. If the thresholds
are met in three of the five years, 100 percent of the performance-vesting shares will vest. If the thresholds are missed in all five years, 100 percent of the performance-vesting shares
will be forfeited. Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the same rate as all other stockholders.

  2013 Goal Performance and Executive Pay Decisions     
        The individual goals described above were determined at the beginning of 2013 as part of AbbVie's annual performance and compensation
planning process. The Committee considered, at both company and individual levels, achievement with respect to these goals, as well as the performance of the individual overall with respect to all
matters not specifically defined in the pre-determined goals, including leadership behaviors and other individual contributions to AbbVie's performance on a qualitative basis. Additionally, the
Committee may also consider unforeseen circumstances or developments in the company, the marketplace and/or the global economy that may have affected performance. 
        For
each named executive officer, a target bonus amount is set as follows: 
        Base
Salary * Target Bonus Percentage = Target Bonus Amount 
To
determine each individual's annual bonus, the Committee considered the named executive officer's target bonus amount and made its final determination of the appropriate award at, above or below the
target bonus amount, considering all of the factors as described above, and in consultation with its independent compensation consultant. While the review is comprehensive, it is not solely formulaic. 
        In
each individual named executive officer's case there were multiple levels of review of the proposed 2013 bonus award. For the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee and its
independent compensation
consultant reviewed the proposed bonus award. For the other named executive officers, AbbVie's Chief Executive Officer, the Committee and its independent compensation consultant reviewed the proposed
awards. 
        Actual
bonuses generally were above the target based on a comprehensive review of individual and corporate performance by the Committee and its independent compensation consultant.

of 90 percent of base pay. Effective February 14, 2013, he received long-term incentives, including a 87,040 share stock option grant and an 42,610 share performance-vesting restricted
stock award. 
 
 
  Post-Termination and Other Benefits     
        Each of the benefits described below supports the company's objective of providing a market competitive total rewards program.
Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that all benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as
previously discussed. 
 Retirement Benefits  
        In 2013, the named executive officers participated in the AbbVie Pension Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are
described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Pension Benefits." 
        Since
Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plan benefits, which are held in trust, named executive officers receive an annual cash
payment equal to the increase in the present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Named executive officers have the option of depositing these annual payments into an individually
established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the named executive officer's actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to
calculate trust funding (currently 8 percent). Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax deferred. Further, named executive 
24



 
Table of Contents
officers
do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to a named executive officer upon retirement from the company generally follows
the manner elected by the named executive officer under the AbbVie Pension Plan. If a named executive officer (or the named executive officer's spouse, depending upon the pension distribution method
elected by the named executive officer under the AbbVie Pension Plan) lives beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit, and therefore exhausts the
trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid to the named executive officer (or his or her spouse) by AbbVie. 
 Deferred Compensation  
        Named executive officers of the company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of their annual base salary to the
AbbVie Savings Plan, the company's qualified savings plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Named executive officers are also eligible to defer up to 18 percent of their base salary, less
contributions to the AbbVie Savings Plan, to a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Up to 100 percent of annual bonus awards earned by the named executive officers are also eligible for
deferral to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Named executive officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and
deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Named executive officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their
grantor trusts. Named executive officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the company. These
arrangements are described in greater detail in this proxy statement beginning with the section captioned "Summary Compensation Table." 
 Change in Control Arrangements  
        AbbVie's named executive officers have change in control agreements, the purpose of which is to aid in retention and recruitment,
encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the company, and to protect the earned benefits of the named executive officers
against adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to
the Committee by its independent compensation consultant. These arrangements are described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or
Change in Control." 
 Financial Planning  
        Named executive officers are eligible for up to $10,000 of annual costs associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation and
general financial planning fees. If a named executive officer chooses to utilize this benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation amount are paid by the company and are treated as
imputed income to the named executive officer, who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due on the fees paid by the company. 
 Company-Provided Transportation  
        Named executive officers are eligible for transportation perquisites that are designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
their work, including the use of a company-leased vehicle and access to company-provided air travel. In some cases, these benefits may be used for personal use, which would then be considered part of
the named executive officer's total compensation and treated as taxable income under applicable tax laws. 
25



 
Table of Contents
 Disability Benefit  
        In addition to AbbVie's standard disability benefits, the named executive officers are eligible for a monthly long-term disability
benefit, which is described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
 
 
  Stock Ownership Guidelines and Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies     
        AbbVie's stock ownership guidelines are designed to further promote sustained stockholder return and to ensure the company's senior
executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives. Each senior executive has five years from the date of election or appointment to his or her position to achieve the ownership level
associated with the position. The minimum stock ownership guidelines are AbbVie stock valued at six times base salary for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and three times base salary for
Executive and Senior Vice Presidents. AbbVie directors are required to own AbbVie stock valued at four times the annual fee for service as a director under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan
within five years of joining the board or as soon as practicable thereafter. 
        As
provided in the Incentive Stock Program, no award may be assigned, alienated, sold or transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order or as permitted by the Committee for estate planning purposes, and no award and no right under any award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered.
All members of senior management, including the company's named executive officers and certain other employees, are required to clear any transaction involving company stock with the General Counsel
prior to entering into such transaction. 
        In
2013, AbbVie reiterated its position with respect to such transactions, instituting a formal policy prohibiting directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, including all of the named executive officers, from entering into or engaging in the purchase or sale of financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market
value of AbbVie equity securities they hold. AbbVie also instituted a formal policy prohibiting directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the named
executive officers, from pledging AbbVie common stock as collateral for a loan. 
 
 
  Compensation Committee Report     
        The compensation committee of the board of directors is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing AbbVie's
compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the Committee's independent compensation consultant to establish AbbVie's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee
reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy
statement. 
 Compensation Committee  
        E. Liddy, Chairman, R. Austin, G. Tilton, and F. Waddell 
 
 
  Compensation Risk Assessment     
        During 2013, AbbVie conducted a risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices, including those related to its executive
compensation programs for its named executive officers. AbbVie's risk assessment included a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its executive compensation and benefit programs. AbbVie also
considered how these programs compare, from a design perspective, to programs maintained by other companies. Based on this assessment, AbbVie determined that its 
26



 
Table of Contents
executive
compensation and benefit programs appropriately incentivize employees and any risks arising from its compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect
on AbbVie. The following factors were among those considered in making this determination:


AbbVie's compensation structure contributes to a corporate culture that encourages our named executive officers to regard
AbbVie as a career employer. For example, AbbVie sponsors a defined benefit pension plan. Equity awards (discussed in more detail below) also vest over multi-year periods. Both programs encourage
AbbVie's named executive officers to consider the long-term impact of their decisions and align their interests with those of AbbVie's stockholders. 
AbbVie's annual incentive program places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other
factors. Since earnings are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of AbbVie's compensation plan also promotes alignment with stockholder interests.  
AbbVie's long-term incentive program focuses named executive officers on longer-term operating performance and stockholder
returns. In 2013, AbbVie's named executive officers received roughly two-thirds of their total compensation in the form of long-term equity incentives (25% of which are stock options that vest over a
multi-year period, and 75% of which are performance awards that vest over a period of up to five years with not more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year). AbbVie's named executive
officers do not receive any of their long-term incentive compensation in cash. 
AbbVie makes equity awards and sets grant prices at the same time each year, at the compensation committee's regularly
scheduled meeting in February. In addition, AbbVie does not award discounted stock options or immediately vesting equity awards. 
AbbVie has robust stock ownership guidelines for its senior executives, which promotes alignment with stockholder
interests. 
AbbVie's compensation committee has the ability to exercise downward discretion in determining annual incentive plan
payouts. In 2013, the compensation committee exercised its discretion to deliver annual incentive plan awards below the maximum amounts allowable according to the plan formula.  
AbbVie requires mandatory training on its code of conduct and policies and procedures to educate its employees on
appropriate behaviors and the consequences of taking inappropriate actions. 
AbbVie does not include certain pay design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, such
as: over-weighting toward annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable thresholds or dramatic changes in payout opportunity at certain performance levels that may encourage
inappropriate short-term business decisions to meet payout thresholds. 

        This
assessment was discussed with the compensation committee and its independent compensation consultant.

Table of Contents 
 
 
  Summary Compensation Table     
        This section contains compensation information for AbbVie's named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2013. Because each of AbbVie's named executive officers was employed by Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") prior to AbbVie's separation from Abbott on January 1, 2013, the information provided for
periods prior to January 1, 2013 reflects compensation earned at Abbott and the design and objectives of Abbott executive compensation programs. All references in the following tables to stock
options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted prior to January 1, 2013 relate to awards granted by Abbott in respect of Abbott common shares. Pursuant to the Employee Matters
Agreement dated December 31, 2012 by and between AbbVie and Abbott, these equity awards, other than performance-based restricted shares granted to named executive officers on December 1,
2012, were converted into awards in respect of AbbVie common stock and awards in respect of Abbott common shares reflecting the respective post-Separation values of AbbVie and Abbott. The
performance-based restricted shares granted to named executive officers on December 1, 2012 were converted entirely into performance-based awards of restricted AbbVie common stock. 
        The
following table summarizes compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to AbbVie's named executive officers in connection with their service to AbbVie during 2013 and, as applicable,
to Abbott before 2013. Mr. Richmond was not a named executive officer before 2013. The section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive
Pay Decisions Are Made" describes in greater detail the information reported in this table.

(1)In
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. AbbVie determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high
and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date.
(2)In
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts include the grant date fair values of $28,837 and $7,135 attributable to AbbVie and Abbott replacement stock options
issued in 2013 to

Table of Contents


L.
Schumacher with respect to original option grants made before 2005. Except for outstanding options that have a replacement option feature, options granted to the named executive officers after 2004
do not include a replacement option feature. Additional information about replacement options is included in the footnotes to the 2013 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.  


(3)These
amounts were determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model (except for replacement options, which are
determined using a lattice model). These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. There is no
certainty that the amount determined using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. For options, other than the
replacement options, the assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value are those described in Note 11, "Equity," of AbbVie's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," in AbbVie's 2013 Annual Report on SEC Form 10-K. For AbbVie replacement options, the valuation model used the following
assumptions: expected volatility of 29.57%, dividend yield of 3.64%, risk-free interest of 0.7%, and an option life equal to 0.51 years. For Abbott replacement options, the valuation model used
the following assumptions: expected volatility of 14%, dividend yield of 1.6%, risk-free interest of 0.2%, and an option life equal to 0.5 years.
(4)The
compensation reported in this column for 2013 was earned as a performance-based incentive bonus pursuant to the AbbVie 2013 Performance Incentive Plan.
Additional information regarding the plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeShort-Term Incentives."
(5)Except
as provided below, the plan amounts shown below are reported in this column.  

The
amounts shown beside each named executive officer's name are for 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, as applicable. Negative amounts under the AbbVie Pension Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental
Pension Plan are excluded from this column in accordance with SEC rules.  
AbbVie Pension Plan
R.
Gonzalez: $3,002 / $(426,732) / $33,248; L. Schumacher: $33,119 / $129,541 / $85,875; W. Chase: $(43,043) / $96,217 / $77,342; C. Alban: $(42,843) / $204,199 / $101,829; and T. Richmond: $(375). 
AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan
R.
Gonzalez: $(717,929) / $(4,420,361) / $743,082; L. Schumacher: $783,337 / $1,464,372 / $939,737; W. Chase: $336,946 / $378,802 / $226,766; C. Alban: $401,517 / $1,521,110 / $628,531; and
T. Richmond: $53,630.  
The
changes in pension value result primarily from the following factors: (i) the effect of changes in the actuarial assumptions AbbVie uses to calculate plan liability for financial reporting
purposes, primarily the change in discount rate; (ii) additional pension benefit accrual under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan; and (iii) the impact of the time value
of money on the pension value.  
Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan Earnings
The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie 2013 Performance Incentive Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan.

R.
Gonzalez: $41,612 / $64,503 / $106,658; L. Schumacher: $128,092 / $177,393 / $112,511; W. Chase: $21,884 / $23,972 / $12,381; C. Alban: $58,250 / $75,700 / $43,995; and T. Richmond: $611. 


(6)The
amounts shown below are reported in this column. The amounts shown beside each named executive officer's name are for 2013, 2012, and 2011,
respectively, as applicable.  

Earnings and Pre-2013 Tax Payments for Non-Qualified Defined Benefit and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plans (net of the reportable interest
included in footnote (5)).  
R.
Gonzalez: $73,532 / $154,681 / $72,623; L. Schumacher: $188,374 / $97,801 / $88,141; W. Chase: $22,474 / $13,526 / $12,458; C. Alban: $79,626 / $42,667 / $33,977; and T. Richmond: $0. 
Each
of the named executive officers' awards under the AbbVie 2013 Performance Incentive Plan is paid in cash to the named executive officer on a current basis and may be deposited into a grantor
trust established by the named executive officer, net of maximum tax withholdings. Each of the named executive officers has also established grantor trusts in connection with the AbbVie Supplemental
Pension Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan. These amounts include the earnings (net of the reportable interest included in footnote (5)) and (for years before 2013) fees and tax payments
paid in connection with these grantor trusts.  
Employer Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans
R.
Gonzalez: $75,000 / $0 / $0; L. Schumacher: $45,000 / $41,584 / $41,375; W. Chase: $39,500 / $19,947 / $18,750; C. Alban: $35,500 / $30,788 / $30,124; and T. Richmond: $27,250. 
These
amounts include AbbVie contributions to the AbbVie Savings Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan. The AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan permits the named executive officers to contribute
amounts in excess of the annual limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions to 401(k) plans up to the excess of (i) 18 percent of their base salary over
(ii) the amount contributed to AbbVie's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. AbbVie matches participant contributions at the rate of 250 percent of the first 2 percent of compensation
contributed to the plan. The named executive officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by the officer, net of maximum tax
withholdings.  
Other 2013 Compensation
The
totals shown in the table include the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the named executive officer: R. Gonzalez: $18,240; L. Schumacher: $17,685;
W. Chase: $14,370; C. Alban: $17,149; and T. Richmond: $14,591.  
The
totals shown in the table include the following costs associated with financial planning: R. Gonzalez: $7,500; L. Schumacher: $10,000; W. Chase: $444; C. Alban: $10,000; and
T. Richmond: $10,000.  
The
totals shown in the table include the following costs for non-business-related air travel: R. Gonzalez: $297,342; L. Schumacher: $9,333. AbbVie determines the incremental cost for flights
based on the direct cost to AbbVie, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees, catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous direct costs. AbbVie also imputes income to the named
executive officer for these costs and the executive pays taxes on that income in accordance with tax regulations.  
For
Mr. Alban, the total includes $5,822 for relocation costs.

(1)When
AbbVie separated from Abbott Laboratories on January 1, 2013, holders of outstanding Abbott equity awards generally received (except to the
extent prohibited by local law or required by award agreement terms) an identical number of AbbVie equity awards to preserve the value of the outstanding Abbott awards. The AbbVie awards resulted from
an anti-dilution adjustment in accordance with terms of the Abbott awards designed to preserve the value of the Abbott awards, so these January 1, 2013 awards are not included in this table.
Additional information about the conversion of the Abbott equity awards in connection with the Separation is included in footnote (1) to the 2013 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
table.
(2)During
2013, each of the named executive officers participated in the AbbVie 2013 Performance Incentive Plan. The annual cash incentive award earned by the
named executive officer in 2013 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table in the column captioned "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No future pay-outs will be made with respect
to the 2013 awards under the plan. The plan is described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay
Decisions Are MadeShort-Term Incentives."
(3)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a five-year term and vest upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity target, with no
more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2013, AbbVie reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards granted on February 14, 2013 vested on
February 28, 2014. The return on equity targets are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned 

31



 
Table of Contents


"Compensation
Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are MadeLong-Term Incentives."  


(4)Shares
of outstanding restricted stock receive dividends at the same rate as all other stockholders. In the event of a grantee's death or disability, these
awards are deemed fully earned. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination
or Change in ControlEquity Awards."
(5)The
grant date fair value of stock awards is determined by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one
share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date.
(6)One-third
of the shares of common stock covered by these options are exercisable after one year, two-thirds after two years, and all after three years. The
options vest in the event of the grantee's death or disability. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
"Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Under the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the average of the
high and low market prices (rounded up to the next even penny) of one share of AbbVie common stock on the date of grant. These options do not contain a replacement option feature.
(7)The
grant date fair value of option awards is determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The assumptions
used to determine the grant date fair value are described in Note 11, "Equity," of AbbVie's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data," in AbbVie's 2013 Annual Report on SEC Form 10-K. The assumptions used to determine the grant date fair value for replacement options are described in footnote (3) to
the Summary Compensation Table.
(8)This
was an AbbVie replacement option. On August 16, 2013, Ms. Schumacher also received an Abbott replacement option upon the exercise of
pre-Separation Abbott stock options that contained a replacement feature. The Abbott replacement option covered 5,671 Abbott common shares, bore an exercise price of $35.03 per share, and expired on
February 19, 2014. None of the remaining AbbVie or Abbott stock options held by any of the named executive officers contain a replacement feature. When it was in effect, the replacement feature
provided that when the exercise price (or withholding tax) for an option with the feature was paid with company common stock held by the named executive officer, a replacement option could be granted
for the number of shares of common stock used to make that payment.

(1)When
AbbVie separated from Abbott on January 1, 2013, outstanding Abbott equity awards generally converted into adjusted awards based on Abbott
common shares and AbbVie common stock (except to the extent prohibited by local law or with respect to certain awards described below).  

Holders
of Abbott restricted shares or restricted stock units generally retained those awards and received restricted stock or restricted stock units of AbbVie in an amount that reflected the
distribution to Abbott shareholders, except for Abbott restricted stock awards granted on December 1, 2012 that converted in full into AbbVie restricted stock awards as of the Separation, as
described in note (d) to footnote (3) below. Such awards are subject to substantially the same terms, vesting conditions and other restrictions that applied to the original Abbott awards
immediately before the distribution. 
Each
Abbott stock option was converted into an adjusted Abbott stock option and an AbbVie stock option, with adjustments to the stock option exercise prices that were intended to preserve the value of
the original Abbott award as measured immediately before and immediately after the distribution. Each such adjusted Abbott stock option and AbbVie stock option is subject to substantially the same
terms,

vesting
conditions, post-termination exercise rules and other restrictions that applied to the original Abbott stock option immediately before the distribution. 
As
a result of the Separation, the named executive officers held the following Abbott equity awards as of December 31, 2013:

R. Gonzalez: Options to purchase 116,967 Abbott common shares with exercise prices

shares with a market value of $2,018,726 as of December 31, 2013, which are partially vested and scheduled to continue to vest through February 27, 2015 (or 2016 or 2017 depending on
achievement of the performance goals in 2015 or 2016). 
L. Schumacher: Options to purchase 271,577 Abbott common shares (including the
replacement option described in footnote (8) to the 2013 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table) with exercise prices ranging from $22.39 to $35.03 per share, which are partially vested and
scheduled to become fully vested on February 17, 2015; performance restricted stock awards covering 43,099 Abbott common shares with a market value of $1,651,985 as of December 31, 2013,
which are partially vested and scheduled to continue to vest through February 27, 2015 (or 2016 or 2017 depending on achievement of the performance goals in 2015 or 2016).  
W. Chase: Options to purchase 19,399 Abbott common shares with exercise prices
ranging from $22.39 to $27.03 per share, which are partially vested and scheduled to become fully vested on February 17, 2015; performance restricted stock awards covering 11,766 Abbott common
shares with a market value of $450,991 as of December 31, 2013, which are partially vested and scheduled to continue to vest through February 27, 2015 (or 2016 or 2017 depending on
achievement of the performance goals in 2015 or 2016). 
C. Alban: Options to purchase 93,900 Abbott common shares with exercise prices
ranging from $22.39 to $27.03 per share, which are partially vested and scheduled to become fully vested on February 17, 2015; performance restricted stock awards covering 28,633 Abbott common
shares with a market value of $1,097,503 as of December 31, 2013, which are partially vested and scheduled to continue to vest through February 27, 2015 (or 2016 or 2017 depending on
achievement of the performance goals in 2015 or 2016). 
T. Richmond: Restricted stock units covering 14,833 Abbott common shares with a
market value of $568,549 as of December 31, 2013, which are scheduled to continue to vest through February 17, 2015.

  Pension Benefits     
        During 2013, the named executive officers participated in two AbbVie-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the AbbVie Pension Plan,
a tax-qualified pension plan; and the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature AbbVie uses to attract
senior executives who are mid-career hires, which provides an additional benefit to such participants that is less valuable to participants who have spent most of their career at the company. Except
as provided in AbbVie's change in control agreements, AbbVie does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. The change in control agreements are described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
        The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named executive officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"
columns of the Summary Compensation Table. 
36




 










Table of Contents 
 Pension Plan  
        The Pension Plan covers most AbbVie employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity
benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  


A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings
multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 



0.50%
of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit
service.  


C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 

        The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age
and employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
        Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Pension Plan
covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
        Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003
who terminate employment prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees hired before 2004
who terminate employment prior to age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired before 2004
who terminate employment prior to age 50 with fewer than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
        The
Pension Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
        Employees
who retire from AbbVie prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at
age 55 with 10 years of service. Employees hired before 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit
service total 70 or more. Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Schumacher, and Mr. Alban are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
        The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires
after reaching age 55,
the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit is
actuarially reduced from age 65. 
37



 
Table of Contents
        The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at
retirement:


In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year
that payments are made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62.  
Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after
reaching age 55 with age plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points
would reach at least 94 before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special
Retirement applies, Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced
12/3 percent for each year between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the
benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per
year for each year that payments are made before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 Supplemental Pension Plan  
        With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Pension
Plan:


Participants' 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and
the 5 highest years of payments under AbbVie's non-equity incentive plans. 
The Pension Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the AbbVie Deferred Compensation Plan in its
calculation of a participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a
participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election or appointment as an officer, AbbVie officers are no
longer eligible to defer compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Pension Plan, the named executive officers are eligible for an
additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefit equal to 0.6% of 5-year final average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant
attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum percentage allowed under the Pension Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B and C above). The portion of this additional benefit
attributable to service before 2004 is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 60. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent
per year for each year that payments are made before age 60 if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion attributable to
service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Pension Plan. The
benefits provided to named executive officers under the Supplemental Pension Plan are not, however, reduced for the period between age 60 and age 62, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced
from age 65. Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Schumacher, and Mr. Alban are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 

38



 
Table of Contents


Vested benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the named
executive officer. Consistent with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those named executive officers who became officers prior to 2009 may
have the entire amount of their vested plan benefits funded through a grantor trust. Any named executive officer who became an officer after 2008 may have only the vested benefits that accrue
following the calendar year in which he or she is first elected as an officer funded through a grantor trust. Vested benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously
funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the participants' income. 

        Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Pension Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to a named executive officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in AbbVie paying the named
executive officer's Supplemental Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in his or her trust are insufficient.

calculates these present values using: (i) a 5.36% discount rate, the same discount rate it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC
Topic 715 calculations for financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's unreduced retirement age, which is age 62 under the AbbVie Pension Plan and age 60 under the AbbVie Supplemental
Pension Plan for those participants who are eligible for early retirement benefits and which is age 65 under both plans for other participants. The present values shown in the table reflect
postretirement mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2000 Combined Healthy table), but do not include a factor for preretirement termination,
mortality, or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan benefits,
to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the named executive officer's individual
trust are expected to offset AbbVie's obligations to him or her under the plan. During 2013, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established
by the named executive officers. Grantor trusts are described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and Analysis2013 Goal Performance
and Executive Pay Decisions."

  2013 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation     
        The following table summarizes Ms. Schumacher's, Mr. Chase's and Mr. Richmond's non-qualified deferred
compensation under the AbbVie Deferred Compensation Plan. No additional contributions have been made to their accounts under the plan since such time as Ms. Schumacher, Mr. Chase and
Mr. Richmond, respectively, became officers and ceased to be eligible to contribute to the plan. None of the other named executive officers has any non-qualified deferred compensation.

(1)Ms. Schumacher's,
Mr. Chase's, and Mr. Richmond's contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan ceased in 2002, 2007, and 2010,
respectively.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 75 percent of their base salary and up to 100 percent of their annual cash incentives and credits
a participant's account with an amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under AbbVie's tax-qualified defined contribution plan.
Participants may direct the investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral account is credited with investment returns based on
the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2013, the weighted average rate of return credited to accounts was 29.4 percent for Ms. Schumacher, 22.1 percent for
Mr. Chase, and 2.1 percent for Mr. Richmond.  

The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make
distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants
may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the hardship.  
(3)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(4)The
amounts reported in this column have not been previously reported as compensation in AbbVie's Summary Compensation Tables because they relate to
contributions made before the applicable individual became a named executive officer. 

 
 
  Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control     
 Potential Payments upon TerminationGenerally  
        AbbVie does not have employment agreements with its named executive officers. 
        The
following summarizes the payments that the named executive officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2013. Earnings would have continued
to be paid for the named executive officer's Performance Incentive Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan grantor trusts until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would
depend on the period over which the trust assets were distributed and the trust earnings and fees. If the trust assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current earnings, the named
executive officers would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period: Mr. Gonzalez, $431,289; Ms. Schumacher, $427,746; Mr. Chase, $296,191;
Mr. Alban, $299,627; and Mr. Richmond, $64,659. In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan for each of the following
named executive officers, respectively: Mr. Gonzalez, $0; Ms. Schumacher, $3,311,908; Mr. Chase, $326,981; Mr. Alban, $1,160,177; and Mr. Richmond, $48,118. As of
December 31, 2013, Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Schumacher, and Mr. Alban were eligible to retire, and therefore were eligible to receive the pension benefits described above. 
40



 
Table of Contents
        If
the termination of employment had been due to disability, then the named executive officers also would have received, in addition to AbbVie's standard disability benefits, a monthly
long-term disability benefit in the amount of $137,500 for Mr. Gonzalez; $53,750 for Ms. Schumacher; $45,833 for Mr. Chase; $42,917 for Mr. Alban; and $21,875 for
Mr. Richmond. This long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 18 months following termination of employment. It ends if the named executive officer retires, recovers, dies or
ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
        In
addition, if the named executive officer's employment had terminated due to death or disability, his or her unvested stock options and restricted stock or unit awards would have
vested on December 31,
2013 with values as set forth below in the subsection of this proxy statement captioned "Equity Awards." 
 Potential Payments upon Change in Control  
        In connection with the Separation from Abbott, AbbVie assumed the change in control agreements between Abbott and the officers
transferring to AbbVie. The agreements with Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Schumacher, and Messrs. Chase, Alban and Richmond are described below. 
        Each
change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2014, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice
of non-renewal is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will
expire on the one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement
is in effect. 
        The
agreements provide that if the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the employee elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below)
within two years following a change in control, he or she is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times his or her annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for
this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period
and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years or, in the case of the
unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the employee elects to terminate
employment for good reason during a potential change in control (see below), he or she is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that
the amount of the bonus to which the employee is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control
event" (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A), the employee will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during
the potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the employee's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the
employee in the preceding three years. 
        Bonus
payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The employee also will receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits,
outplacement services and tax and financial counseling, and the value of three more years of pension accruals). If change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax
imposed under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, payments under the agreement will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the employee in a better
after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under AbbVie's incentive stock programs can be terminated and
generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. The compensation committee's independent
compensation consultant has confirmed that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market practice. 
41



 
Table of Contents
        For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of AbbVie securities representing 20 percent
or more of the outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from AbbVie and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the board of directors whose appointment was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving AbbVie. A "potential change in control" under
the agreements includes, among other things, AbbVie's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the
employee's position, duties, or authority; the company's failure to pay the employee's compensation or a reduction in the employee's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of the company's principal
executive offices to a location that is more than 35 miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
        If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2013, immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Schumacher, and
Messrs. Chase, Alban and Richmond would have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control
agreements:


Mr. Gonzalez: Cash termination payments$13,500,000; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits$9,675,893; Welfare and fringe benefits$37,131. 
Ms. Schumacher: Cash termination payments$4,232,414; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits$1,118,022; Welfare and fringe benefits$53,668. 
Mr. Chase: Cash termination payments$4,858,500; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits$753,488; Welfare and fringe benefits$59,982. 
Mr. Alban: Cash termination payments$4,366,500; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits$2,066,620; Welfare and fringe benefits$64,980. 
Mr. Richmond: Cash termination payments$3,106,500; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits$198,184; Welfare and fringe benefits$64,385. 

        The
amounts shown for Ms. Schumacher's cash termination payments and additional supplemental pension plan benefits reflect reductions that would have applied under cutback
provisions in the agreement as described above. 
 Equity Awards  
        Under the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program, any outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock or unit awards granted prior
to February 2013 (including awards converted into adjusted awards based on Abbott common shares and AbbVie common stock in connection with the Separation) vest upon a change in control, including
performance-based restricted shares, which are deemed earned in full. This program, which was approved by AbbVie's stockholders, covers approximately 6,500 participants, including a broad group of
management and professional staff. In addition, unvested equity awards converted into adjusted awards based on Abbott common shares in connection with the Separation would vest in full upon a change
in control of Abbott. 
        Beginning
with awards granted in February 2013, upon a change in control the surviving company may assume, convert or replace the awards on an equivalent basis. If the surviving company
does not do so, the vesting of the awards is accelerated. If the surviving company does assume, convert or replace the awards on an equivalent basis, then accelerated vesting of the awards is limited
to circumstances in which, during the period from six months before through two years after a change in control, the grantee's employment is terminated without cause or the grantee resigns for good
reason. The terms "cause" and "good reason" have the same definitions as in the change in control agreements. 
42



 
Table of Contents
        If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2013 and the surviving company did not assume, convert or replace any of the awards granted after January 2013, then the
unvested equity awards of the named executive officers would have vested as follows:


Mr. Gonzalez would have vested in (1) 616,330 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $11,124,505 and
89,900 unvested Abbott stock options with a value of $1,100,800, and (2) 310,387 shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $16,391,537 and 52,667 Abbott restricted shares with a value
of $2,018,726. 
Ms. Schumacher would have vested in (1) 226,805 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $4,352,047 and
78,038 unvested Abbott stock options with a value of $925,168, and (2) 173,531 shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $9,164,172 and 43,099 Abbott restricted shares with a value of
$1,651,985. 
Mr. Chase would have vested in (1) 135,229 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $2,450,221 and
19,399 unvested Abbott stock options with a value of $248,534, and (2) 112,867 shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $5,960,506 and 11,766 Abbott restricted shares with a value of
$450,991. 
Mr. Alban would have vested in (1) 163,163 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $3,153,753 and
47,333 unvested Abbott stock options with a value of $605,557, and (2) 120,854 shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $6,382,300 and 28,633 Abbott restricted shares with a value of
$1,097,503. 
Mr. Richmond would have vested in (1) 87,040 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $1,473,587,
(2) 72,210 shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $3,813,410, and (3) 14,833 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $783,331 and 14,833 Abbott restricted stock units
with a value of $568,549. 

        The
value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of one share of common stock on December 31, 2013 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied
by the number of unvested stock options held by the named executive officer. The value of restricted stock shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted shares that would vest as of
December 31, 2013 and the closing price of one share of common stock on December 31, 2013. The value of restricted stock units shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted
stock units that would vest as of December 31, 2013 and the closing price of one share of common stock on December 31, 2013. 
 
 
  RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS ABBVIE'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)     
        AbbVie's audit committee charter provides that the audit committee shall appoint annually AbbVie's independent registered public
accounting firm. In October 2013, the audit committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to act as AbbVie's independent registered public accounting firm for 2014. 
        Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, it would like to know the opinion of the stockholders regarding its
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP for 2014. For this reason, stockholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst &
Young LLP for 2014, the audit committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
        Representatives
of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They
will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
        The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as AbbVie's independent registered public
accounting firm for 2014.

  AUDIT INFORMATION     
 
    Dismissal of Deloitte & Touche LLP     
        The combined balance sheet of AbbVie as of December 31, 2012 and the related combined financial statements for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2012 were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"). On December 14, 2012, AbbVie's audit committee approved the dismissal of Deloitte
as AbbVie's independent registered public accountant, effective as of the date of Deloitte's completion of the audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012 and the filing of the
company's 2012 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. Deloitte completed the audit services for such fiscal year and the filing of AbbVie's 2012 Annual
Report was completed on March 15, 2013, and, therefore, the effective date of Deloitte's dismissal was March 15, 2013. 
        The
report of Deloitte on the combined financial statements of AbbVie for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the preparation of the company's financial
statements from the separate financial statements and accounting records of Abbott. 
        As
it relates to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and through March 15, 2013, the effective date of Deloitte's dismissal, (i) there were no
disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the company and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of
the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
        In
connection with filing a Current Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K/A, the company provided Deloitte with a copy of the disclosures in such Current Report
and requested that Deloitte provide the company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not Deloitte agreed with the disclosures therein. A copy of
Deloitte's letter, dated March 19, 2013, is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to AbbVie's Current Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K/A filed on March 19, 2013. 
 
 
  Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Ernst & Young LLP     
        On December 14, 2012, AbbVie's audit committee approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the company's
independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit services beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013. On October 9, 2013, AbbVie's audit committee
approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to perform independent audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014. Through December 14, 2012, neither the
company, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Ernst & Young regarding either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the
type of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the combined financial statements of Abbott's research-based pharmaceuticals business or the consolidated financial statements of the
company, in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to the company by Ernst & Young that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by the company in
reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv)
of Regulation S-K and the
related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

(1)In
2013, Ernst & Young billed or will bill AbbVie for professional services rendered for the audit of AbbVie's annual financial statements, the
audits of AbbVie's internal control over financial reporting, statutory and subsidiary audits, the review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and certain accounting
consultations in connection with the audits. In 2012, the Deloitte Entities billed Abbott for professional services rendered for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements, the audits of
Abbott's internal control over financial reporting, statutory and subsidiary audits, the review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and certain accounting consultations in
connection with the audits.
(2)Audit
related fees include: accounting consultations and audits in connection with proposed acquisitions and divestitures, audits of certain employee
benefit plans' financial statements, and, in 2012, audits and audit related services in connection with the separation of AbbVie from Abbott, including associated filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
(3)Tax
fees consist principally of professional services for tax compliance and tax planning and advice including assistance with tax audits and appeals, and
tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions. In 2013, tax fees also include expatriate tax return services provided by Ernst & Young.
(4)In
2013, all other fees represent Independent Review Organization services provided by Ernst & Young. In 2012, all other fees primarily represent
consulting services for an information technology project engagement Abbott entered with a firm before that firm's acquisition by a Deloitte Entity in 2011.  

 
 
  Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
        The audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by
the independent registered public accounting firm and its related affiliates. 
        Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered
during that year for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
45



 
Table of Contents
        Prior
to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public
accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the
independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific pre-approval before
engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
        The
audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the audit
committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
 
 
  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT     
        Management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of AbbVie's consolidated financial statements. The independent registered
public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the board of directors. In this context, the audit committee has reviewed and
discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K with AbbVie's management and its independent registered public accounting firm. 
        The
audit committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standards Section AU 380
(Communication with Audit Committees), as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
        The
audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent
registered public accounting firm the firm's independence. The audit committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the
independent registered public accounting firm. 
        Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in AbbVie's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Audit Committee  
        R. Austin, Chair, W. Burnside, E. Rapp, and F. Waddell 
 
 
  SAY ON PAYAN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)     
        Stockholders are being asked to approve the compensation of AbbVie's named executive officers, as disclosed under Securities and
Exchange Commission rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material included in this proxy statement. 
        The
independent compensation committee of the board of directors, with the counsel of its independent compensation consultant, has thoroughly examined AbbVie's programs, the company's
performance related to our industry and high-performing peer group, and market factors. The committee has determined that the specific pay decisions for the named executive officers are appropriate
given the company's performance, the executives' contributions, and our stockholders' interests. 
46



 
Table of Contents
        While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the board of directors and the compensation committee value the opinion of the stockholders and will review the voting results and take them
into account when future compensation decisions are made. 
        Accordingly, the board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named executive officers' compensation.
 
 
  PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS     
        It is AbbVie's policy that the nominations and governance committee review, approve, ratify or disapprove of all transactions in which
AbbVie participates and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per
fiscal year. Related person transactions
requiring review by the nominations and governance committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:


questionnaires annually distributed to AbbVie's directors and executive officers;  
certifications submitted annually by AbbVie executive officers related to their compliance with AbbVie's Code of Business
Conduct; or 
communications made directly by the related person to the chief financial officer or general counsel. 

        In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the nominations and governance committee will consider the following items, among
others:


the related person's relationship to AbbVie and interest in the transaction;  
the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness,
the amount of principal involved; 
the benefits to AbbVie of the transaction; 
if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;  
an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third
party or to employees generally; 
whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and  
whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 

        This
process is included in the nominations and governance committee's written charter, which is available on the corporate governance section of AbbVie's investor relations website at  www.abbvieinvestor.com. 
 
 
  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION     
 
    Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance     
        AbbVie believes that during 2013 its executive officers and directors timely complied with all filing requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
 
  Performance-Based Compensation Arrangements     
        The Performance Incentive Plan and the Incentive Stock Program, which are described above, are intended to comply with Internal Revenue
Code Section 162(m) to ensure deductibility of performance-based compensation. 
47



 
Table of Contents
        The
compensation committee reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The committee believes that stockholder
interests are best served by not restricting the committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation
expenses. Accordingly, the committee may from time to time approve components of compensation for certain executive officers that are not deductible. 
        While
the compensation committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award decisions were based would
occur, the committee, in evaluating such circumstances, has discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of stockholders up to and including actions to recover such incentive
awards. 
 
 
  Exclusive Forum     
        AbbVie is incorporated in the state of Delaware and Delaware law governs the relationship among its directors, officers, and
stockholders (also known as the internal affairs doctrine). To provide for the orderly, efficient and cost-effective resolution of Delaware-law issues affecting AbbVie, the company's Certificate of
Incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, Delaware courts are the exclusive forum for cases involving the internal affairs doctrine, derivative actions brought on
behalf of the company, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, and other matters concerning Delaware statutory and common law. The provision does not apply to any other cases brought against AbbVie. 
 
 
  Other Matters     
        The board of directors knows of no other business to be transacted at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but if any other matters
do come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote or act with respect to them in accordance with their best judgment. 
 
 
  Date for Receipt of Stockholder Proposals for the 2015 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement     
        Stockholder proposals for presentation at the 2015 Annual Meeting must be received by AbbVie no later than November 15, 2014 and
must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2015 meeting. 
 
 
  Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting     
        A stockholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the
secretary of AbbVie. Recommendations must be accompanied by certain information about both the nominee and the stockholder making the nomination, as set forth in AbbVie's Amended and Restated By-Laws.
A nominee who is recommended by a stockholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
        A
stockholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a stockholder of record on:


the record date for that Annual Meeting, 
the date of this proxy statement, and 
the date of the Annual Meeting, 

48



 
Table of Contents
may
nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the secretary of AbbVie. 
        That
notice must include certain information required by Article II of AbbVie's Amended and Restated By-Laws, including information about the stockholder, any beneficial owner on
whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or associates or others acting on concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
        For
each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting
such business at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the stockholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director
nomination, the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
        To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at AbbVie's principal executive
offices not less than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is more than
thirty days before or sixty days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be received not less than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the date of such
Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of ninety days prior to the date of such Annual Meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of such Annual Meeting is
less than one hundred days prior to the date of such Annual Meeting, the tenth day following the day on which
public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by AbbVie. To be timely for the 2015 Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by AbbVie no later than February 5, 2015. 
        In
addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the
Annual Meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the secretary of AbbVie at AbbVie's principal executive offices not
more than five business days after the record date for the Annual Meeting, and not less than eight business days before the date of the Annual Meeting in the case of any update or supplement required
to be made as of ten business days prior to the Annual Meeting. 
 
 
  Householding of Proxy Materials     
        The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers or banks) to satisfy
the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice or proxy statement addressed to those security
holders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies. 
        Several
brokers and banks with accountholders who are AbbVie stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice provided by these brokers to AbbVie
stockholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once you have
received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at
any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and you prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker or contact Broadridge Financial Solutions 1-800-542-1061,
email: sendmaterials@proxyvote.com, or write us at Investor Relations, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, Illinois 60064. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of
