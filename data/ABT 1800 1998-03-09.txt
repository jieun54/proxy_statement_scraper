ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 24,
1998, at the corporation's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, at the
intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy
statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or
about March 10, 1998. The corporation will bear the cost of making solicitations
from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies
may be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees of
the corporation and its subsidiaries. The corporation has retained Georgeson &
Company Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of
$14,000 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE
 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 1998, will be
entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 1998,
the corporation had 764,456,112 outstanding common shares, which are the only
outstanding voting securities.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING OF PROXIES
 
A shareholder may vote in person, by a duly executed proxy, or through an
authorized representative. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize
no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies
may be revoked at any time prior to the meeting. This may be done by written
notice delivered to the secretary of the corporation, or by signing and
delivering a proxy with a later date.
 
All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected.
 
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive
to elect the 16 nominees hereinafter named. These
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

shares may be voted cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive
fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee
become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute
designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 16 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable.
 
Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of
the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, the ratification of the
appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, or the approval of the
shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters,
the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as specified. Where no choice
has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification of the 1998 Abbott
Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan and Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors and
AGAINST the shareholder proposal.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of
the shareholders with respect to that matter. Abstentions and withheld votes
have the effect of votes against a matter.
 
A proxy may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such
proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur,
for example, when a broker or bank is not permitted to vote stock held in street
name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present
and, therefore, not entitled to vote on such matter, although these shares may
be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares
will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be
decided at the meeting.
 
It is the corporation's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations
that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not
be disclosed except: (i) where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
(ii) where disclosure may be necessary in order for the corporation to assert or
defend claims, (iii) where a shareholder writes comments on his or her proxy
card, (iv) where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, (v) to allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or (vi) in limited
circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved
and recommended by the board of directors.
 
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and
voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not
employees of the corporation.
 
With the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board of directors is not
aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If
other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy
will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY OWNERSHIP
 
On January 31, 1998, the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust, c/o Abbott
Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500, held
57,106,464 common shares (approximately 7.5 percent of the outstanding common
shares) of the corporation. These shares were held for the individual accounts
of approximately 35,250 employees and other plan participants who participate in
the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan. The Stock Retirement Trust is
administered by both a trustee and three co-trustees. The trustee of the Trust
is Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are G. P. Coughlan, T. C.
Freyman, and E. M. Walvoord, officers of the corporation. The voting power with
respect to the shares owned by the Trust is held by and shared among the
co-trustees. The co-trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions from
the participants, if the co-trustees determine that a matter to be voted on at a
shareholder meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The
individual participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by
the terms of the Trust. The Trust Agreement is of unlimited duration. The
co-trustees are also fiduciaries for certain other employee benefit trusts
maintained by the corporation and have shared voting and/or investment power
with respect to the 296,940 common shares (approximately .04 percent of the
outstanding shares of the corporation) held by those trusts.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The board of directors, which held six meetings in 1997, has four committees
established in the corporation's bylaws: the executive committee, audit
committee, compensation committee, and nominations and board affairs committee.
 
The executive committee, whose members are D. L. Burnham, chairman, H. L.
Fuller, W. D. Smithburg, J. R. Walter, and W. L. Weiss, did not hold any
meetings in 1997. This committee may exercise all the authority of
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               2

the board in the management of the corporation, except for matters expressly
reserved by law for board action.
 
The audit committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chairman, K. F. Austen,
D. A. Jones, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell, Jr., and J. R. Walter, held two meetings
in 1997. This committee provides advice and assistance regarding accounting,
auditing, and financial reporting practices of the corporation. Each year, it
recommends to the board a firm of independent public accountants to serve as
auditors. The audit committee reviews with such auditors the scope and results
of their audit, fees for services, and independence in servicing the
corporation. The committee also meets with the corporation's internal auditors
to evaluate the effectiveness of the work they perform.
 
The compensation committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, B. Powell,
Jr., A. B. Rand, W. D. Smithburg, and W. L. Weiss, held three meetings in 1997.
This committee is responsible for setting and administering the policies and
programs that govern both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.
 
The nominations and board affairs committee, whose members are D. A. Jones,
chairman, K. F. Austen, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, and W. A. Reynolds, held two
meetings in 1997. This committee develops general criteria regarding the
qualifications and selection of board members and officers, recommends
candidates for such positions to the board of directors, and advises the board
of directors with respect to the conduct of board activities, including
assisting the board in the evaluation of the board's own performance. A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director or directly
nominate persons for director by complying with the procedures on page 18.
 
The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 1997
was 98 percent.
 
- --------------------------------------------------

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
Report of the Compensation Committee
 
The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.
 
The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:
 
    - Integrates compensation programs which link total shareholder return with
      both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and
      measurement processes.
 
    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.
 
    - Helps attract and retain key executives critical to the long-term success
      of the corporation.
 
The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.
 
The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies are included in the Standard and Poor's Healthcare
Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and
performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison.
 
Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements -- base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation -- is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.
 
In 1997, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.
 
Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively
taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining
the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases.
 
The Abbott Management Incentive Plan is designed to reward executives when the
corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's area
of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial
elements such as profitability, total sales, and basic earnings per share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Each year, individual incentive
targets are established for incentive plan participants based on competitive
survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, targets
are set to deliver total compensation between the mid and upper range of
competitive practice as warranted by corporate performance. For 1997, 40% of the
target award was earned for achievement of the corporation's basic earning per
share goal. The remainder of the targeted incentive was earned based on the
committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the
predetermined goals discussed above.
 
The corporation has provided forms of equity participation as a key part of its
total program for motivating and rewarding executives and managers for many
years. Grants of stock options and restricted stock have provided an important
part of the equity link to
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shareholders. Through these vehicles, the corporation has encouraged its
executives to obtain and hold the corporation's stock. Targeted award ranges for
stock options and restricted stock opportunities are determined taking into
account competitive practice among the comparison companies noted above. Equity
participation targets are set based on established salary ranges and level of
performance. As noted above, the target ranges are established such that equity
participation opportunities will be in the mid-to-upper range of pay practices
of peer companies when merited by corporation and individual performance.
 
Actual individual awards are determined based on the established competitive
target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance.
The committee considers the amounts of options and restricted stock previously
granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional
options and restricted stock.
 
In 1997, the committee granted Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 4.0% which was consistent with the
corporation's established merit increase program. As reflected in the
corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 1997 included 7.9%
growth in sales, and 12.9% growth in basic earnings per share. In light of this
performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the committee
determined to grant Mr. Burnham a bonus, stock options and restricted stock.
 
It is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for
executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and
its stockholders in achieving the corporation's long-term business objectives.
To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and take
action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained. As a
result, shareholders are being asked to approve a new Performance Incentive Plan
for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Operating
Officer and Senior Officers of the corporation that is designed to meet the
performance-based compensation criteria of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1993 and to permit deductibility of awards paid under the Performance
Incentive Plan.

TABLE FOOTNOTES
 
(1) Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted in tandem with these
    options. These rights are only exercisable for 60 days following a change in
    control of the corporation. Upon exercise, the optionee must surrender the
    related option and will receive a payment, in cash, in an amount equal to
    the difference between the option's price and the fair market value of the
    shares subject to the option. These options contain a replacement option
    feature. When the option's exercise price is paid (or, in the case of non-
    qualified stock options, when the option's exercise price or the withholding
    taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of the
    corporation's common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number
    of shares used to make that payment. The replacement option has an exercise
    price equal to the market value of the corporation's common stock on the
    date of the original option's exercise and a term expiring on the expiration
    date of the original option.
 
(2) One-third of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one
    year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.
 
(3) The dollar amounts under these columns are the result of calculations at the
    5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and, therefore, are not intended to
    forecast possible future
    appreciation, if any, of the stock price.
(4) Amounts were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 1997
    of 764,094,053 and December 31, 1997 closing market price of $65.50 per
    share.

Annuity Retirement Plan
 
The corporation and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan
known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees
in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on
service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120
months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits.
 
The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis without giving effect to Social Security offsets and include
supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplement pension plan.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. The compensation considered
in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation
shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on
page 11 and, for D.L. Burnham and T. R. Hodgson, the restricted stock awards
vesting during the year ($436,875 and $244,650, respectively, for 1997).
Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all participants
in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan
with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts
established on behalf of the officers who participate in that plan. During 1997,
the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such
individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: D. L. Burnham,
$1,266,816; T. R. Hodgson, $264,666; G. P. Coughlan, $61,447; P. N. Clark,
$1,407,597; R. L. Parkinson, Jr., $156,823; and M. D. White, $65,476. As of
December 31, 1997, the years of service credited under the Plan for the named
officers were as follows: D. L. Burnham - 15; T. R. Hodgson - 25; G. P. Coughlan
- -7; P. N. Clark - 13; R. L. Parkinson, Jr. - 21; and M. D. White - 13.

Compensation of Directors
 
Employees of the corporation are not compensated for serving on the board or
board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each
month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as a chairman of
a board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee).
 
Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form
of non-qualified stock options, or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of the
corporation or paid into a secular trust established by the director) until
payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon retirement from the board of
directors). If the fees are deferred, the director may elect to have the fees
credited to a stock equivalent account under which the fees accrue the same
return they would have earned
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13

if invested in common shares of the corporation. Interest is accrued annually on
deferred fees not credited to a stock equivalent account.
 
If a non-employee director elects to receive any or all of his or her directors'
fees in the form of non-qualified stock options, the fees covered by that
election are converted into stock options based upon an independent appraisal of
the value of the options. The Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program
was amended in 1997 to provide that these options be granted annually, on the
date of the annual shareholder meeting. Prior to its amendment, the Program
provided that the options be granted on the date the corresponding fees would
otherwise have been paid. The options have a purchase price equal to the fair
market value of the shares covered by the option on the grant date. An option
may be exercised during the ten year period following its grant and provides for
the automatic grant of a replacement stock option if all or any portion of its
exercise price is paid by delivery of common shares of the corporation. The
replacement stock option covers the number of shares surrendered to pay the
original stock option's exercise price, has an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of such shares on the date the replacement stock option is granted,
is exercisable in full six months from the date of grant, and expires on the
expiration date of the original stock option.
 
Under the Program, each non-employee director who is elected to the board of
directors at the annual shareholder meeting receives a restricted stock award
with a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding,
twenty-two thousand dollars for 1997 and forty-seven thousand dollars for 1998.
In 1997, this was 373 shares. The non-employee directors are entitled to vote
these shares and receive all dividends paid on the shares. The shares are
nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a
change in control of the corporation.
 
Prior to its amendment in 1997, the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors'
Fee Plan provided for retirement benefits consisting of the payment of an amount
equal to the monthly director's fee in effect on the date the director retired
(or, for a director who died, the fee in effect on the date of death) for a
period equal to his or her service on the board to a maximum of 120 months. In
return for the retirement benefit, the director agreed to provide consulting
services to the board. In 1997, the board of directors amended the Plan to stop
the accrual of additional retirement benefits. Each of the non-employee
directors was credited with 120 months of service and given a choice between
having his or her accrued retirement benefit frozen or having its present value
converted into stock equivalent units. The stock equivalent units accrue the
same return as would have been earned if the present value of those retirement
benefits had been invested in common shares of the corporation. These retirement
benefits are non-funded obligations of the corporation.
 
In 1997, K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services for the
corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement in the areas of research and
development, new technology, and immunopharmacology. The consulting agreement,
which expires on March 31, 1999, provides that the fees he earns under the
agreement may receive the same treatment as fees earned under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. In 1997, Dr. Austen received
$50,000 for his consulting services.

1998 ABBOTT LABORATORIES PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM NO. 2 ON PROXY CARD)
 
The board of directors has adopted, subject to ratification by the shareholders,
the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The text
of the Plan is set forth in Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The board of
directors recommends that the shareholders vote FOR ratification of the Plan.
 
The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain outstanding individuals as
senior officers of the corporation and its subsidiaries and to furnish an
incentive to such persons to increase profits by providing them with the
opportunity to earn a bonus based on the financial performance of the
corporation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit on the
amount of compensation that may be deducted by the corporation in any tax year
with respect to each of the corporation's five most highly paid executives.
However, certain performance-based compensation that has been approved by
shareholders is not subject to this deduction limit. The Plan is designed to
provide for this type of performance-based compensation and to permit the
corporation to take the corresponding tax deduction.
 
The Plan will be administered by the compensation committee of the board of
directors. The committee has sole responsibility for selecting participants,
establishing performance objectives, setting award targets, and determining
award amounts. It may adopt rules for the administration of the Plan.
 
Under the Plan, all bonuses are based on consolidated net earnings. The amount
of a participant's bonus is determined as follows. First, the Plan establishes a
base award allocation. The Plan sets the base award allocation for the Chief
Executive Officer at .0015 of the consolidated net earnings of the corporation
for the fiscal year; the base award allocation for the Chief Operating Officer
at .0010 of consolidated net earnings; and the base award allocation for any
other participant at .00075 of consolidated net earnings. Each base award is
increased by interest, at prevailing market rates, accrued on bonuses deferred
or paid to grantor trusts. The committee then determines the participant's
actual bonus. To do this, the committee adjusts the participant's base award
allocation. The committee may not award a bonus in excess of the maximum amount
determined under the Plan, but may grant a smaller bonus. In determining the
amount of a participant's bonus, the committee will consider the participant's
individual performance.
 
The size of the 1998 base award allocations cannot be determined at this time.
It is believed, however, that had this Plan been in effect during 1997, the
bonuses received by the named officers would not have been any larger than those
that are set forth opposite their names in the bonus column of the Summary
Compensation Table on page 11.
 
The board of directors, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval,
may modify, amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan.

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (ITEM NO. 3 ON PROXY CARD)
 
The bylaws of the corporation provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit
committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent
public accountants to serve as auditors and that such appointment shall be
submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board
has appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This
firm has served as auditors of the corporation since 1963. The board of
directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen
LLP as independent public accountants for 1998.
 
Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to
do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE CERES PRINCIPLES (ITEM NO. 4 ON PROXY CARD)
 
WHEREAS WE BELIEVE: Responsible implementation of a sound, credible
environmental policy increases long-term shareholder value by raising
efficiency, decreasing clean-up costs, reducing litigation, and enhancing public
image and product attractiveness;
 
Adherence to public standards for environmental performance gives a company
greater public credibility than standards created by industry alone. For maximum
credibility and usefulness, such standards should specifically meet the concerns
of investors and other stakeholders;
 
Companies are increasingly being expected by investors to do meaningful,
regular, comprehensive and impartial environmental reports. Standardized
environmental reports enable investors to compare performance over time. They
also attract investment from investors seeking companies which are
environmentally responsible and which minimize risk of environmental liability.
 
The Coalition for Environmental Responsible Economics (CERES) - which includes
shareholders of this company, public interest representatives, and environmental
experts - consulted with corporations to produce the CERES Principles as
comprehensive public standards for both environmental performance and reporting.
Scores of companies, including Bank America, Baxter International, Bethlehem
Steel, General Motors, H.B. Fuller, ITT Industries, Pennsylvania Power and
Light, Polaroid, and Sun (Sunoco), have endorsed these principles to demonstrate
their commitment to public environmental accountability and standardized
reporting. Fortune 500 endorsers say that the benefits of working with CERES are
public credibility; direct access to major environmental and shareholder
organizations, leadership in designing the rapidly advancing standardization of
environmental disclosure, and measurable value-added for the company's
environmental initiatives;
 
A Company endorsing the CERES Principles commits to work toward:
 

   
           Protection of the      6.         Safe products /
1.                                           services
           biosphere              7.         Environmental
2.         Sustainable natural               restoration
           resource use           8.         Informing the public
3.         Waste reduction and    9.         Management
           disposal                          commitment
4.         Energy conservation    10.        Audits and reports
5.         Risk reduction

 
[Materials on the CERES principles and CERES Report Form are obtainable from
CERES, 711 Atlantic Avenue, Boston, MA 02110, Tel: 617-451-0927, fax:
617-482-2028].
 
CERES is distinguished from other initiatives for corporate environmental
responsibility by being (1) a successful model of shareholder relations; (2) a
leader in public accountability through standardized environmental reporting;
and (3) a catalyst for significant and measurable environmental improvement
within firms.
 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Company to endorse the CERES Principles as a
part of its commitment to be publicly accountable for its environmental impact.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
PROPONENTS' STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE CERES PRINCIPLES
 
Many investors support this resolution. Those sponsoring similar resolutions at
various companies have portfolios totaling $75 billion. Furthermore, the number
of public pension funds and foundations supporting this resolution increases
every year. We believe the CERES Principles exceed the European Community
regulation for voluntary participation in verified publicly-reported
eco-management and auditing, and that they also exceed the requirements for ISO
14000 certification.
 
Your vote FOR this resolution will encourage both scrutiny of our Company's
environmental policies and reports, and adherence to goals supported by
management and shareholders alike. We believe the CERES Principles will protect
both your investment and your environment.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE CERES
PRINCIPLES (ITEM NO. 4 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Your board of directors opposes the shareholder proposal and recommends that you
vote AGAINST the proposal.
 
Abbott is committed to operating its businesses in an environmentally
responsible manner. Abbott considers environmental responsibility a priority
that helps protect our planet for future generations and that also makes good
business sense. To this end, the corporation's written environmental policy
requires that all Abbott employees and operations throughout the world comply
with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The policy describes the
corporation's commitment to implement environmental management practices and
programs which help to protect human health and the environment, including
continuing efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and the release of pollutants
into the environment, to conserve resources, to reuse and recycle materials
where feasible at every stage of the product life cycle, and to reduce,
eliminate or change the use of materials
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17

or practices as appropriate which may adversely affect human health and the
environment. The policy also promotes environmental training and education of
employees. The corporation's compliance with its environmental policy
substantially implements the objectives of the CERES Principles.
 
Abbott has developed this policy because it represents a sound use of the
corporation's resources and is part of the corporation's commitment to being a
responsible member of the communities in which we operate. The corporation is
committed to continuous improvement in this area.
 
The corporation files hundreds of environmental reports with federal, state, and
local government agencies. Imposing another layer of standards and reports that
would be required as a CERES signatory is duplicative and will unnecessarily
drive up costs.
 
For these reasons, the board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the
proposal.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
DATE FOR RECEIPT OF 1999 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
Shareholder proposals for presentation at the 1999 Annual Meeting must be

SECTION 7. SUCCESSORS
 
    7.1 OBLIGATIONS.  All obligations of Abbott under the Plan with respect to
