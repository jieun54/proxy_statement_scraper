Abbott Laboratories  
 Proxy Statement  
Solicitation of Proxies  

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 26, 2002, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 12, 2002. 

 
 
Information about the Annual Meeting     
Who Can Vote 

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2002 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2002, Abbott had 1,556,593,143
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
Cumulative Voting 

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy 

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most
of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting by
telephone or the Internet can be found with your proxy card. 
Revoking a Proxy 

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 
    by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott, 
    by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
    by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy.

Discretionary Voting Authority 

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 14 nominees named in
Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 14 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer
votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, or the approval of the shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder
has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification of Arthur
Andersen LLP as auditors and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
With
the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may
properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy 

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on that matter, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote
for other purposes. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies which are present and
entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
Inspectors of Election 

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
Cost of Soliciting Proxies 

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies
may be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $17,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
Confidential Voting 

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 




where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,





where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims,





where a shareholder provides comments with a proxy,





where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure,





to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or





in other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors.

Committees of the Board of Directors     
The
board of directors, which held six meetings in 2001, has five committees established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and board
affairs committee, and public policy committee. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, H. L. Fuller, D. A. Jones, W. A. Reynolds, and W. D. Smithburg, did not hold any meetings in
2001. This committee may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chairman, R. S. Austin, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr., and J. R. Walter, held four meetings in 2001.
This committee provides advice and assistance regarding accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices of Abbott. Each year, it recommends to the board a firm of independent public
accountants to serve as auditors. The audit committee reviews with such auditors the scope and results of their audit, fees for services, and independence in servicing Abbott. The committee also meets
with Abbott's internal auditors to evaluate the effectiveness of the work they perform. The committee is governed by a written charter adopted by the board of directors. Each of the members of the
audit committee is independent and financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. A copy of the report of the audit committee is on pages 17
and 18. 
The
compensation committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, J. M. Greenberg, B. Powell Jr., A. B. Rand, and W. D. Smithburg, held two meetings in
2001. This committee is responsible for setting and administering the
policies and programs that govern both annual compensation and stock ownership programs. A copy of the report of the compensation committee is on pages 11 and 12. 
The
nominations and board affairs committee, whose members are D. A. Jones, chairman, J. M. Greenberg, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, and R. S. Roberts,
held two meetings in 2001. This committee develops general criteria regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, recommends candidates for such positions to the board of
directors, advises the board of directors with respect to the conduct of board activities, and assists the board in the evaluation of the board's own performance and the performance of the chairman of
the board and chief executive officer. A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by complying with the procedures on page 20. 
The
public policy committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, D. A. Jones, W. A. Reynolds, R. S. Roberts, and J. R. Walter, held three meetings in 2001.
This committee has an advisory role with respect to public policy, regulatory, and governmental affairs issues that affect Abbott. 
The
average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 2001 was 98 percent. 

 
 
Compensation of Directors     
Abbott
employees are not compensated for serving on the board or board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors'
Fee Plan in the amounts of $6,667 for each month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as a chairman of a board committee. 
Fees
earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair market value), or deferred
(as a non-funded obligation of Abbott or paid into a grantor trust established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon retirement from the board of
directors). If the fees are deferred, the director may elect to have the fees credited to a stock equivalent account under which the fees accrue the same return they would have earned if invested in
Abbott common shares. Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees not credited to a stock equivalent account. 
Under
the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder meeting receives a restricted stock award with
a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding $65,000. In 2001, this was 1,429 shares. The non-employee directors are entitled to vote these shares and receive all
dividends paid on the shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of Abbott.

Executive Compensation     
Report of the Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is responsible for setting and administering the
policies and programs that govern annual compensation, long-term incentives and stock ownership programs. 
The
foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values and management initiatives. The program: 




Integrates compensation programs which link total shareholder return with both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and measurement processes.





Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual performance that is related to both goals and performance of the corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.





Helps attract and retain key executives who are critical to the long-term success of the corporation.



The
key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive award, and long-term incentive awards comprised of equity participation. These components are administered with the
goal of providing total
compensation that is competitive in the marketplace, recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance, offers the opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance and links management's interest in the company with the interest of all shareholders. 
The
marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology emphasis. These companies are included in the
Standard and Poor's® Health Care-500 Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison. 
Using
compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total compensation and each of its elements  base, incentive and long-term equity-based
compensation  is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by the corporation's
performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation programs which are based upon achievement of the
corporation's goals. Each year the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall objectives
discussed above. 
In
2001, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual performance and on the extent to which the business plans for the corporation and their areas of responsibility were achieved or
exceeded. Performance goals were substantially met or exceeded and, therefore, compensation was paid accordingly. Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's performance,
current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the job, experience and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of the corporation. While many aspects of performance can
be measured in financial terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools, including the
development and execution of strategic plans, the development of management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these
factors were collectively taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases. 
The
Abbott Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) and Management Incentive Plan (MIP) are designed to reward executives when the corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's
area of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial elements such as consolidated net earnings, profitability, total sales and earnings per share, and non-financial
elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and the successful development of human resources, including Abbott's diversity initiative. Each year, individual base award allocations
are established for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2001, each PIP participant's final award allocation was based on the committee's overall assessment of each
participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
Each
year, individual incentive targets are established for MIP participants based on competitive survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, awards are paid at levels
commensurate with performance of the company relative to peer group companies. Under the MIP, 40% of a participant's target incentive award is attributable to corporate performance. 

11

 


The remainder of the incentive award is based on the committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
To
motivate and reward its executives and managers and to directly align key employee and shareholder interests, the corporation has provided long-term incentives in the form of equity participation
for many years. Grants of stock options, replacement stock options and restricted stock awards are important parts of this relationship. To ensure this objective is achieved, executives follow fixed
stock ownership guidelines. 
Targeted
award ranges for stock options and restricted stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation
targets are set based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the target ranges are established such that equity awards are appropriately scaled to the performance of
the company within its peer group. 
Actual
individual awards are determined based on the established competitive target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance. The committee considers the amounts of
options and restricted stock previously granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional options and restricted stock. 
In
2001, the committee granted Mr. White, the corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 4.0%. As reflected in the corporation's financial statements,
Abbott's performance in 2001 included an 18.5% growth in sales, and a 5.6% growth in diluted earnings per share, excluding certain non-recurring charges. In addition, the committee noted that Abbott's
stock price in 2001 increased by 15.1% in a difficult year for both the industry and the stock market in general. In light of this performance and their overall assessment of his performance,
particularly the successful integration of the Knoll acquisition, the committee determined to award Mr. White a bonus, a stock option grant and an award of restricted stock. 
It
is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders in achieving the
corporation's long-term business objectives. To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and takes
action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

Gain for all Shareholders at Assumed Rates for Appreciation (4):
 

$54,503,192,940
 

$138,121,791,952







(1)These
amounts assume hypothetical appreciation rates of 5% and 10% over the term of the option, as required by the SEC, and are not intended to forecast the appreciation of the stock
price. No gain to the named officers will occur unless the price of Abbott's common shares exceeds the options' exercise price.
(2)These
options contain a replacement option feature. When the option's exercise price is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise price or the
withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of Abbott's common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number of shares used to make that payment. The
replacement option has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Abbott's common stock on the date the replacement option is granted, is exercisable in full six months after the date of
grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option.
(3)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.
(4)Amounts
were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 2001 of 1,554,530,292 and a December 31, 2001 closing market price of $55.75 per share.

Pension and Retirement Arrangements 

Abbott and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension
benefits are generally based on service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120 months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits are
partially offset for Social Security benefits. 
The
following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life annuity basis
without giving effect to Social Security offsets and include supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 13. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established
on behalf of all participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts
established on behalf of the officers who participate in that plan. During 2001, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings,
were deposited in such individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: M. D. White, $118,131; R. A. Gonzalez, $47,830;
C. B. Begley, $25,785; and W. G. Dempsey, $54,741. As of December 31, 2001, the years of service credited under the Plan for the named officers were as follows:
M. D. White - 17; R. A. Gonzalez - 21; J. M. Leiden - 1; C. B. Begley - 15; and W. G. Dempsey - 19. 

Key Employee Retention 

Abbott has change in control arrangements with its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for other key management personnel. The
agreements with the named officers are described below. 
The
agreements with the named officers continue in effect until December 31, 2004, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year thereafter unless Abbott
notifies the officer that the agreement will not be extended. The agreements also automatically extend for two years following any change in control that occurs while they are in effect. The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for specified reasons or if the officer elects to terminate employment under certain circumstances during a potential change in control
or within two years following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and bonus (assuming for this purpose
that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro
rata bonus for any current bonus period (both based on the highest of the actual bonus earned, the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, or the average bonus for the past three years). The
officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including the value of three more years of pension accruals), payment of a portion of any excise taxes and other related
taxes and payments for which the officer is responsible as a result of the agreement, and reimbursement of certain legal, tax and audit fees. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards
under Abbott's stock incentive programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. Independent compensation consultants confirm that the
level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market practice. 

15

 
Under
the agreements, a "change in control" occurs on the earliest of the following dates: 




The date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) becomes the beneficial owner of, or obtains voting control over, 20% or more of the
outstanding common shares of Abbott.





The date on which Abbott (A) merges or consolidates with or into another corporation, or merges another corporation into Abbott, in which Abbott is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of Abbott are
converted into cash, securities of another corporation, or other property, other than a merger or consolidation of Abbott in which holders of common shares immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the
surviving corporation or its parent corporation immediately after the merger as immediately before, or (B) sells or otherwise disposes of substantially all of Abbott's assets.





The date on which there has been a change in a majority of the board of directors of Abbott within a 12-month period unless the nomination for election by Abbott's shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote of two-thirds of the
directors then still in office who were in office at the beginning of the 12-month period.



A
potential change in control occurs if Abbott enters into an agreement which would result in a change in control, Abbott or anyone else publicly announces an intent to take or consider actions which
would constitute a change in control, any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of Abbott's common shares, or Abbott's board adopts a resolution that a potential change in
control exists. 
Abbott's
stock incentive programs provide that, as of the date of a change in control, all outstanding stock options and limited stock appreciation rights become fully exercisable and the terms and
conditions of any outstanding restricted stock awards are deemed satisfied. The stock incentive programs use a definition of change in control that is generally similar to the definition used in the
agreements except that a change in control is triggered when an entity or person becomes the beneficial owner of, or obtains voting control over, 30% or more of the outstanding common shares of
Abbott.

Selection of Independent Public Accountants (Item 2 on Proxy Card)     
Abbott's
bylaws provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent public accountants to serve as auditors and that such
appointment shall be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. In October 2001, the board appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This
firm has served as Abbott's auditors since 1963. 
The
board and audit committee have been monitoring and have reviewed, in detail, the press coverage regarding Arthur Andersen LLP in its role as auditors of Enron Corp. In addition, the audit
committee has discussed this and other matters with senior representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP. The audit committee has concluded, based on information available to date, that such matters should
not impair the ability of that firm to provide quality and independent audit services to Abbott and, therefore, recommends that Arthur Andersen LLP should serve as Abbott's independent public
accountants for 2002. The board and audit committee will continue to closely monitor and evaluate any further developments in this matter. 
Abbott
also maintains an internal auditing function that evaluates and formally reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures. The audit committee,
which meets at least four times a year, has unrestricted access to Abbott's internal audit function. The committee meets privately with the head of internal audit several times each year. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen LLP as independent public accountants for 2002.  
Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will
also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees 

For 2001, Arthur Andersen LLP and its affiliates billed or will bill Abbott an aggregate of $5.9 million for professional services rendered for the audit of Abbott's 2001 financial statements
and the review of Abbott's financial statements included in Abbott's quarterly reports on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q. Of this amount, $1.4 million were one-time fees
related to Abbott's acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. 
Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees 

For 2001, neither Arthur Andersen LLP nor any of its affiliates rendered any professional services for Abbott in connection with Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation. 
All Other Fees 

For 2001, Arthur Andersen LLP and its affiliates billed Abbott, an aggregate of $8.0 million for all other non-audit services performed for Abbott. Of this amount, $3.5 million related
to international tax support and $2.2 million were one-time fees related to Abbott's acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF. 

 
 
Report of the Audit Committee     
Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an audit of Abbott's financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for expressing an opinion on those financial statements based on their audit. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the
board of directors. In this context, the committee has reviewed
and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2001 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent auditors. 
The
committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by
the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees), as amended. 
The
committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence
Discussions with Audit Committees), as amended, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence. The committee has also considered whether the provision of
the services described above under the captions "Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees" is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
auditors. 

17


  


Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2001 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Audit Committee 

W. A. Reynolds, chairman, R. S. Austin, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr., and J. R. Walter. 

 
 
Shareholder Proposal     
A
shareholder proposal is included in this proxy statement. Abbott is advised that the proposal will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed resolution and the statement made in
support thereof are presented below. The names and addresses of the shareholders submitting the proposal will be furnished by Abbott to any person requesting such information.  The board of directors recommends that you vote
AGAINST the proposal.

 
 
Shareholder Proposal on HIV/AIDS-TB-Malaria (Item 3 on Proxy Card)
Whereas:
The HIV/Aids epidemic constitutes a global emergency - one of the most formidable challenges to human life and dignity as well as to the effective enjoyment of human rights; 
By
the end of the year 2000, 36.1 million people worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS, 90% in developing countries and 75% in sub-Sahara Africa; 
All
are affected by this epidemic, but people in developing countries are the most affected, and women, young adults and children, particularly girls, are the most vulnerable; 
African
Heads of Governments have pledged to target at least 15% of their annual national budgets to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Actions to reach this target will need to be complemented by
international assistance; 
Tuberculosis
is now the world's leading infectious killer, taking 2 million lives a year, and is a frequent complication of AIDS. Malaria causes 1.1 million deaths annually. Both diseases are growing
more difficult to treat because of the spread of drug-resistant strains; 
Access
to medication in the context of such pandemics is a fundamental element of achieving physical and mental health; 
Effective
prevention, care and treatment strategies will require increased availability of, and nondiscriminatory access to, vaccines, sterile injecting equipment, drugs, including anti-retroviral
therapy, diagnostics and related technologies, as well as increased research and development; 
Availability
and affordability of drugs and related technology are factors to be reviewed and addressed. There is need to reduce the cost of these drugs and technologies; 
Some
countries within the most seriously affected regions have begun to promote innovation and the development of domestic industries in order to increase access to medicines to protect the people's
health; 
The
impact of international trade agreements on access to or local manufacturing of, essential drugs and on the development of new drugs needs to be evaluated; 
THEREFORE
BE IT RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors to develop and implement a policy to provide pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria in ways
that the majority of infected persons in African nations can afford. 
A
report of the development and implementation of such a policy (omitting proprietary information and at reasonable cost) would be sent to shareholders six months after the 2002 annual meeting. 

 
 
Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     
Pharmaceutical
companies have the unique mission to provide health-giving medicines, often making the difference between life and death. This is the time for pharmaceutical companies to offer the kind
of leadership necessary to address diseases that afflict so many people throughout the world, especially in African countries. "Making life-saving medicines more affordable for poor countries is vital
for improving public health. More importantly, it is realistic." (Press Release, WHO/WTO Workshop-Pricing/Financing of Essential Drugs, April 11, 2001) One way to make needed drugs accessible
and affordable is to grant voluntary licenses to African countries which request them. This would enable the production of generic drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Improved
access to effective and affordable medicines is essential for the people's health in these nations.

Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to Shareholder Proposal on HIV/AIDS-TB-Malaria (Item 3 on Proxy Card)     
Abbott
Laboratories has several programs in place to help people in the developing world address what have come to be known as "diseases of poverty". The company's efforts are primarily focused on
people with HIV/AIDS, because of Abbott's expertise in this area. 
In
March 2000, Abbott announced that it would make its HIV protease inhibitor drugs, Norvir® and Kaletra®, and its HIV rapid test, Determine, available in
Africa at prices that return no profit to Abbott. In April of 2000 Abbott
extended this offer to include all of the United Nations' list of Least Developed Countries, making a total of 68 developing countries in which these products can be accessed. To advance its efforts
to expand access to its HIV/AIDS care products in these countries, Abbott is a part of the Accelerating Access Initiative, a joint effort by Abbott and other companies that produce anti-retroviral
drugs, along with the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS, The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. 
The
company has taken further steps to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the developing world through its philanthropic program, Step Forward for the World's Children. Step Forward is a long-term,
multi-million dollar effort to support AIDS orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries hit hard by AIDS. Step Forward supports or initiates programs to address health care, voluntary
counseling and testing, education and basic community needs. 
Abbott
is also making efforts to help developing countries address malaria. Through its acquisition of the pharmaceutical business of BASF, Abbott became a manufacturer of bulk artesunate, a compound
that can be used to treat malaria. Abbott is working with the World Health Organization to supply bulk artesunate at no profit for the WHO's malaria treatment programs in developing countries. 
Abbott
has no products or expertise in the field of tuberculosis treatment. 
Abbott
has already developed and implemented programs in these areas, and has announced many of them to the public. Therefore, the resolution is unnecessary. 
The board of directors recommends you vote AGAINST the proposal.

 
 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance     
Abbott
believes that during 2001 its officers and directors complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  

 
 
Other Matters     
In
1999, shareholder derivative actions were filed against Abbott's then current directors and certain former directors relating to Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the United States Food and Drug
Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Division facilities in Lake County, Illinois. In March 2001, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois dismissed these complaints. The plaintiffs have appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That appeal remains pending. A virtually identical action filed in
state court was also dismissed in light of the federal court dismissal. These derivative actions alleged the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allowing the alleged
regulatory noncompliance and causing Abbott to pay $100 million to the federal government and withdraw certain medical diagnostic kits from the U.S. market. The plaintiffs requested unspecified
monetary damages, including punitive and exemplary damages, to be paid to Abbott, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various other forms of relief. 
Shareholder
derivative suits relating to the settlements reached by TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. with the United States Department of Justice and with each of the fifty states and the District of
Columbia with respect to certain of TAP's marketing and pricing practices have been filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against all of Abbott's current directors, with the exception of
R. A. Gonzalez (who was not a director at the time of the settlements). TAP is a 50 percent owned joint venture of Abbott. These derivative actions allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary
duties by failing to take action to prevent these marketing and pricing practices. The plaintiffs request a return of salaries, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various other forms of
relief. 
As
required by its articles of incorporation, Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of the present and former directors named in these suits.

Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2003 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement     
Shareholder
proposals for presentation at the 2003 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 13, 2002 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2003 meeting.  

 
 
Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting     
A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and board affairs committee or the
secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. 
A
shareholder may directly nominate persons for director only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit the names of such persons in writing to the secretary of Abbott not
earlier than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. The nominations must be accompanied by a statement setting forth the
name, age, business address, residence address, principal occupation, qualifications, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominee and the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott
owned by the shareholder making the nomination. 
A
shareholder may properly bring business before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit to the secretary of Abbott, not earlier
than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting, a written statement describing the business to be discussed, the reasons for
conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the shareholder making the submission, and a description of any material interest of
the shareholder in such business.
