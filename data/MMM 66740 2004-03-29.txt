THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND PROXY CARD ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED ON OR ABOUT MARCH 29, 2004. 


iii 










PROXY STATEMENT 
        The Board of Directors (the Board) of 3M Company (3M or the
Company) is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. You are receiving a proxy statement because you own
shares of 3M common stock that entitle you to vote at the meeting. By
use of a proxy, you can vote whether or not you attend the meeting. The
proxy statement describes the matters we would like you to vote on and
provides information on those matters so you can make an informed
decision. 
        The information included in this proxy statement relates to proposals
to be voted on at the meeting (if properly presented), voting process,
compensation of directors and our most highly paid officers, and other
required information. 
Purpose of the Annual Meeting 
        The purpose of the Annual Meeting is to elect directors and to conduct
the business described in the Notice of Annual Meeting. 
Annual Meeting Admission 
        Only stockholders are invited to attend the meeting. An admission
ticket or proof of ownership of 3M stock, along with personal
identification, must be presented in order to be admitted to the Annual
Meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record,
your admission ticket is on the back of this proxy statement. If your
shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of
record, you must bring a brokerage statement or other proof of
ownership with you to the Annual Meeting, or obtain an admission ticket
in advance. Tickets are also available on the Internet voting site 
www.eproxy.com/mmm. 
        No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags,
briefcases, or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. 
Quorum 
        A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to hold a meeting.
Under 3Ms Bylaws, a quorum requires a majority of the outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting must be represented in
person or by proxy at the meeting. Both abstentions and broker
non-votes are counted as present for determining the presence of a
quorum. Broker non-votes, however, are not counted as shares present
and entitled to be voted with respect to the matter on which the broker
has not voted. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of
any of the matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Generally,
broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker for a beneficial
owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because (1)
the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial
owner and (2) the broker lacks discretionary voting power to vote such
shares. 
Stockholders Entitled to Vote 
        Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business
on March 12, 2004, the record date, is entitled to one vote
at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought before the
meeting. As of that date, there were
782,963,687 shares of
common stock issued and outstanding. 
        Most 3M stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank,
trustee, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As
summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of
record and those owned beneficially: 




  
 
STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD  If your shares are registered
directly in your name with 3Ms Transfer Agent, Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and
these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by 3M. As the
stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy
directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting.  


  
 
BENEFICIAL OWNER  If your shares are held in a stock
brokerage account, by a bank, trustee, or other nominee, you are
considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these
proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, trustee, or
nominee who is considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As
the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee
or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend 









1 









  

the meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you
may not vote these shares in person at the meeting. Your broker,
trustee, or nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting
instruction card for you to use. 


  
 
If your shares are held in your account in the 3M Voluntary
Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings
Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of these shares and the
trustee of the plans is the stockholder of record. Participants in
3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or
the 3M Savings Plan may direct the trustee how to vote the shares
allocated to their account by following the voting instructions
contained on the proxy card. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan may also direct the trustee how
to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares of common stock for
which it has not received direction, and shares not allocated to
individual participant accounts by following the same voting
instructions. If you fail to direct the trustee how to vote your shares
by following these voting instructions, the trustee will vote your
shares as described in the voting instructions.  





Proposals You Are Asked to Vote On and the Boards Voting
Recommendations 
        The following proposals are scheduled to be voted on at the meeting.
3Ms Board recommends that you vote your shares as indicated below. 




Proposals: 
The Boards Voting Recommendation: 

 1. The election of directors for a 3-year term
FOReach nomineeto the Board

 2. The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers
     LLP as 3Ms independent auditors
FOR

 3. Proposal to Approve an Amendment to the Certificate of
     Incorporation to Increase the Authorized Common Stock
FOR

 4. Consideration of a stockholder proposal to separate the positions      of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, if it is      properly presented at the meeting.
AGAINST




        Other than the proposals described in this proxy
statement, the Board is not aware of any other matters to be presented
for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy by telephone,
Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the
persons named as proxy holders  W. James McNerney, Jr., 3Ms
Chairman and CEO, Edward A. Brennan, and Rozanne L. Ridgway  will
have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters
properly presented for a vote at the meeting. If any of our nominees is
unavailable as a candidate for director, the above-named proxy holders
will vote your proxy for another candidate or candidates as may be
nominated by the Board of Directors. 
Required Vote 
        Director Nominees  The nominees for election as directors at the
Annual Meeting will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the
meeting. This means that the director nominee with the most votes for a
particular slot is elected for that slot. Votes withheld from one or
more director nominees will have no effect on the election of any
director from whom votes are withheld. 
        Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation  The affirmative FOR
vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock
entitled to vote is required to approve the amendment to the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation. Since stockholder approval is dependent
upon receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding common stock, any abstention, broker non-vote or other
failure to cast an affirmative vote for this proposal will have the
effect of a vote against this proposal. 
        Except as noted above, all other proposals require the affirmative
FOR vote of a majority of those shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.
If 







2 













you are a beneficial owner and do not provide the stockholder of record
with voting instructions, your shares may constitute broker non-votes,
as described in the section above entitled Quorum. In tabulating
the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute
broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal.
The stockholder proposal is presented as a request to the Board to take
action. Affirmative votes for this proposal will inform the Board about
the level of interest in this proposal. 
Voting Methods 
        If you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record, you may vote
by granting a proxy or, if you hold shares beneficially in street name,
by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. If you own
shares beneficially as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may
vote by submitting voting instructions to the trustee. In most
instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone,
or by mail. Please refer to the summary instructions below and those
included on your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the
voting instruction card included by your broker or nominee. 

        The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to
authenticate stockholders by use of a control number and to allow you
to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you
vote by telephone or on the Internet, you do not need to return your
proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting facilities for
stockholders of record
will be available 24 hours a day, and will close at
12:00 p.m.
(Central
Time) on the day before the
Annual Meeting. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and
Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan may instruct the
trustee how to vote their shares via the Internet, by telephone, or by
signing and returning the proxy card by 5:00 p.m. (Central Time) on
May 6, 2004. 



  
 
 VOTE BY INTERNET  www.eproxy.com/mmm  If
you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy from any location
in the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card and
the last four digits of your social security number in hand when you
access the Web site. You will be prompted to enter the last four digits
of your social security number, your 3-digit company number, and the
7-digit number located below the company number (the last two numbers
are located in the upper right corner of the proxy card) to create an
electronic ballot.  


  
 
 VOTE BY TELEPHONE  1-800-560-1965  If you live in the
United States, you may use any touch-tone telephone to vote your proxy
toll-free 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card and the
last four digits of your social security number in hand when you call.
You will be prompted to enter the last four digits of your social
security number, your 3-digit company
number, and the 7-digit number located below
the company number (the last two numbers are located in the upper right
corner of the proxy card). Follow the recorded
instructions.  


  
 
VOTE BY MAIL  You may do this by signing your proxy card or,
for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card included by
your broker or nominee and mailing it in the enclosed, postage-paid,
addressed envelope. If you provide specific voting instructions, your
shares will be voted as you instruct. If you sign, but do not provide
instructions, your shares will be voted as the Board recommended. Mark,
sign, and date your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid
envelope provided so that it is received by May 10, 2004.  





        All shares that have been properly voted and not revoked will be voted
at the Annual Meeting. 
Changing Your Vote 
        You may change your proxy instructions at any time prior to the vote at
the Annual Meeting. For shares held directly in your name, you may
accomplish this by granting a new proxy or by voting in person at the
Annual Meeting. For shares held beneficially by you, you may change
your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker or
nominee. 
Counting the Vote 
        In the election of directors, you may vote FOR all of the
nominees or your vote may be WITHHELD from one or more of the
nominees. For the other proposals, you may vote FOR, 







3 










AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. If you ABSTAIN, it has the same
effect as a vote AGAINST. If you sign your proxy card or broker
voting instruction card with no further instructions, your shares will
be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares
held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee
Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the
trustee as described in
Stockholders Entitled
to Vote on page 1. 
        Representatives of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 3Ms transfer agent, will
tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of election. 
Confidentiality 
        The Companys Board of Directors has a policy that all stockholder
proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders are to be
maintained in confidence. No such document will be available for
examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder will not be
disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote.
The policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder
votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company.
Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card
that may be forwarded to 3M management. 
Results of the Vote 
        We will announce preliminary voting results at the meeting and publish
final results in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ending June 30, 2004. A news release with voting results will
be available on our Web site
www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml. 
Delivery of Proxy Materials 
        Securities and Exchange Commission rules now allow us to deliver a
single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household at
which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the stockholders
are members of the same family. This rule benefits both you and the
Company. We believe it eliminates irritating duplicate mailings that
stockholders living at the same address receive and it reduces our
printing and mailing costs. This rule applies to any annual reports,
proxy statements, proxy statements combined with a prospectus, or
information statements. Each stockholder will continue to receive a
separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
        Your household may have received a single set of proxy materials this
year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years,
please request a duplicate set by contacting our transfer agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064
(outside the U.S.),
www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices, or in writing to
161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075. 
        If a broker or other nominee holds your shares, you may continue to
receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate
duplicate account mailings by allowing stockholders to consent to such
elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does not
request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and
nominees may offer stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate
duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or nominee
directly to discontinue duplicate mailings from your broker to your
household. 
List of Stockholders 
        The names of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual
Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for ten days prior
to the meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting, between the
hours of 7:45 a.m. and
4:30 p.m. (Central), at our principal
executive offices at 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota, by contacting the
Secretary of the Company. 
Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials and Annual Report 
        We are able to distribute the Annual Report and
proxy
statement to 3M
stockholders in a fast and efficient manner via the Internet. This
reduces the amount of paper delivered to a stockholders address and
eliminates the cost of sending these documents by mail. Stockholders
may elect to view all future annual reports and proxy statements on the
Internet instead of receiving them by mail. If you choose to view these
materials online, you will continue to receive a proxy card in the
mail. You may make this election when voting your proxy this year:
simply follow the instructions to vote via the Internet or go 







4 











directly to www.econsent.com/mmm to register your
consent. Have your account number (found above your name and address on
your dividend check stub) and your
social
security
number (if you have one)
available. Your election to view proxy materials online continues until
you revoke it. Future proxy cards will contain the Internet Web site
address and instructions to view the materials. You will continue to
have the option to vote your shares by telephone, mail, or via the
Internet. 

Cost of Proxy Solicitation 
        3M will pay for the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing,
and distributing these proxy materials. You will need to obtain your
own Internet access if you choose to access the proxy materials and/or
vote over the Internet. In addition to mailing these proxy materials,
the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by
telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers,
and employees, who do not receive any additional compensation for these
solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder
Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy
materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson
Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $15,000 plus expenses for
these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials
to beneficial owners of stock. 
Transfer Agent 
        Our Transfer Agent is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All communications
concerning stockholders of
record accounts, including address changes, name changes, common stock
transfer requirements, and similar issues can be handled by contacting
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064 (outside
the U.S.), www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices, or in
writing, 161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075.

GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
        The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that, along with
the charters of the Board committees, provide the framework for the
governance of the Company. The Boards Nominating and Governance
Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing the Guidelines at
least annually, and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for
approval. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our Web
site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations 
Corporate Governance. The Guidelines and charters of the Board
committees are also attached to this proxy statement as Appendices A-E. 
Presiding Director 
        Independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions without the
Chairman/CEO and may select a director to facilitate the meeting. The
chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and
Public Issues Committees of the Board may chair executive sessions of
the independent directors at which the principal items to be considered
are within the scope of the committee chairs authority. The Board
believes that this practice ensures leadership at all executive
sessions of the independent directors without needing to designate a
lead director. 
Communication with Directors 
        The Board of Directors has adopted the following process for
stockholders to send communications to
members of the Board. Stockholders may

Director Independence 
        The Board of Directors believes in having a substantial majority of
independent directors on the 3M Board. Pursuant to the New
York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Board has adopted Director
Qualification Standards with respect to the determination of director
independence. In accordance with these Standards, the Board must
affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship
with the Company (directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of
an organization that has a relationship with the Company) other than as
a director. The Standards specify the criteria by which the
independence of our directors will be determined, including strict
guidelines for directors and their immediate families with respect to
past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent
auditor. The Standards also prohibit Audit Committee members from any
direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and
restrict commercial relationships of all directors with the Company.
Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by
the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arms length
with the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance
that might be perceived as a conflict of interest. 
        To be considered independent for purposes of these Standards, a
director must be determined, by resolution of the Board, after due
deliberation, to have no material relationship with the Company other
than as a director. In each case, the Board shall broadly consider all
relevant facts and circumstances and shall apply the following
standards: 




   
1.  
   
In
no event will a director be considered independent if, within the preceding three years:
(i) a director was employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (ii) an immediate
family member was employed by the Company as an officer; (iii) a director received, or
whose immediate family member received, more than $100,000 per year in direct
compensation from 3M or a consolidated subsidiary (other than director fees); (iv) a
director was affiliated with or employed by, or whose immediate family member was
affiliated with or employed in a professional capacity by, a present or former internal
or external auditor of 3M; (v) a director who was employed, or whose immediate family
member was employed, as an executive officer of another company where any of 3Ms
present executives serve on that companys compensation committee; or (vi) a
director was an executive officer or an employee, or whose immediate family member was an
executive officer, of a company that made payments to, or  








6 









   
   
   
received payments
from, 3M for property or services in an amount which, in any single fiscal year, exceeded
the greater of $1 million, or two percent of the directors companys
consolidated gross revenues.  


 


   
2.  
   
Audit
Committee members may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from
3M, other than directorsfees. 


 


   
3.  
   
The
following commercial relationships will not be considered to be material relationships
that would impair a directors independence: (i) if a 3M director is an executive
officer or employee of another company that does business with 3M and the annual sales
to, or purchases from, 3M are less than or equal to one percent of the annual
consolidated gross revenues of the company he or she serves as an executive officer; or
(ii) if a 3M director is an executive officer or employee of another company which is
indebted to 3M, or to which 3M is indebted, and the total amount of either companys
indebtedness to the other is less than or equal to one percent of the total consolidated
assets of the company he or she serves as an executive officer.The Board will annually
review all commercial relationships of directors. Whether directors meet these
categorical independence tests will be reviewed annually and will be made public in the
proxy statement prior to their standing for re-election to the Board.  


 


   
4.  
   
For
relationships not covered by the guidelines in paragraph 3 above, the determination of
whether the relationship is material or not, and therefore whether the director would be
independent or not, shall be made by the directors who satisfy the independence
guidelines set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 above. For example, if a director is the CEO
of a company that purchases products and services from 3M that are more than one percent
(but not more than two percent) of that Companys annual revenues, the independent
directors could determine, after considering all of the relevant circumstances, whether
such a relationship was material or immaterial, and whether the director would therefore
be considered independent under the NYSE rules. The Company would explain in the next
proxy statement the basis for any Board determination that a relationship is immaterial
despite the fact that it does not meet the categorical standards of immateriality set
forth in paragraph 3 above.  


 


   
5.  
   
The
Company will not make any personal loans or extensions of credit to directors. All
directors are required to deal at arms length with the Company and its subsidiaries
and to disclose circumstances material to the director that might be perceived as a
conflict of interest.  






        The Board of Directors has determined that every director, with the
exception of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, W.
James McNerney, Jr., is independent under these Standards. The Board
has also determined that no members of the Audit Committee received any
compensation from the Company other than directors fees. 
3M Business Conduct Policies 
        More than a century of operating with honesty and integrity has given
3M trust from our customers, credibility with our communities, and
dedication from our employees. All of our employees, including our
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal
Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3Ms long-standing
business conduct policies to ensure that our business is conducted in a
consistently legal and ethical manner. These policies form the
foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with
corporate policies and procedures and a companywide focus on
uncompromising honesty and integrity in every aspect of our operations.
Our business conduct policies cover many topics, including antitrust
and competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting,
protection of confidential information, and compliance with all laws
and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business. 
        Employees are required to report any conduct that they believe in good
faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the business conduct
policies. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive,
retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the
confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. 







7 










        The Board of Directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
for directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing
principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure the
Companys business and the activities of the Board are conducted with
integrity, adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in
compliance with the law. 
        The Companys Business Conduct Policies for employees and the Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are available on our Web site
at www.3M.com under Investor Relations  Corporate
Governance. 
BOARD STRUCTURE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP 
        The Board is divided into three classes serving staggered three-year
terms. The Board has eleven directors and the following four
Committees: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Public
Issues. The membership during 2003 and the function of each Committee
are described below. 
        During 2003, the Board of Directors held six regular and one telephonic
meetings. The Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and
Public Issues Committees held five, five, four, and three regularly
scheduled meetings, respectively, and both the Audit and Compensation
Committees held one telephonic meeting during 2003. All of our
directors attended all of the regularly scheduled and special
telephonic meetings of the Board and Board Committees on which they
served, except that one director was unable to attend a specially
scheduled telephonic meeting of a
Committee on which he
serves. 
        The Board and each
Committee conducted an
evaluation of their performance in 2003.

Audit Committee 
        The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the integrity
of the Companys financial statements, compliance with legal and
regulatory requirements, the qualifications, independence, and
performance of the Companys independent auditor, and the performance
of the Companys internal auditing department. In addition, the
Committee: 



  
 
Reviews the annual audited and quarterly consolidated
financial statements;

disclosure and internal controls and procedures, including major issues

Committee, Edward M. Liddy, has financial management expertise under
the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. In addition, Mr. Liddy qualifies as audit committee financial expert within
the meaning of SEC regulations. The Board has determined that service
on more than three other audit committees by Aulana Peters does not
impair her ability to serve effectively on the Companys Audit
Committee because Mrs. Peters is retired and has the time to devote to
her responsibilities and has considerable expertise in audit committee
matters. The charter of the Audit Committee is available at
www.3M.com under Investor Relations  Corporate
Governance  Committee Composition and attached as Appendix B to this

performance, and annually prepares a report on executive compensation
for inclusion in the Companys proxy statement. In addition, the
Committee:

of the Board, employment agreements and severance arrangements for the
CEO, as appropriate;

succession plans. In addition, the Committee: 



  


be submitted for election at the Annual Meeting and candidates to fill

policies, programs, actions, and procedures which will enable this
Company to continue to respond appropriately to its social

members are independent under the New York Stock Exchange listing
standards. The charter of the Public Issues Committee is available at

NOMINATION PROCESS 
Role of the Nominating and Governance Committee 
        The Nominating and Governance Committee (Committee) identifies
individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to become Board
members in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria set forth
below, and recommends selected individuals to the Board for nomination
to stand for election at the next meeting of stockholders of the
Company in which directors will be elected. In the event there is a
vacancy on the Board between meetings of stockholders, the Committee
identifies individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to
become Board members in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria
set forth below, and recommends one or more of such individuals for
appointment to the Board. 
Nominees Proposed by Stockholders for Consideration by the Committee 

        The Committee has a policy to consider properly submitted stockholder
nominees for candidates for membership on the Board of Directors.
Stockholders proposing individuals for consideration by the Committee
must include at least the following information about the proposed
nominee: the proposed nominees name, age, business or residence
address, principal occupation or employment, and 







10 











whether such person has given written consent to being named in the
proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected.
Stockholders should send the required information about the nominee
to: 
      Corporate Secretary      3M Company      3M Center      Building
0220-13-W-39      St. Paul, MN
55144-1000. 
        In order for an individual proposed by a stockholder to be considered
by the Committee for recommendation as a Board nominee, the Corporate
Secretary must receive the proposal no later than 5 p.m. Central Time
on November 29, 2004. Such proposals must be sent via
registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the
stockholder to determine when the proposal was received by the
Company). The Corporate Secretary will send properly submitted
stockholder proposed nominations to the Committee Chair for
consideration at a future Committee meeting. Individuals proposed by
stockholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same
consideration that individuals identified to the Committee through
other means receive. 
Stockholder Nominations 
        In addition, 3Ms Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors at
an annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting at which
directors are to be elected in accordance with the notice of meeting.
Stockholders intending to nominate a person for election as a director
must comply with the requirements set forth in the Companys Bylaws.
Our Bylaws require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary
receive written notice from the record
stockholder no earlier
than January 11, 2005, and no later than February 10, 2005. The notice must contain the information required by the
Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request to the Corporate
Secretary. Nominations received after February 10, 2005, will
not be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
Director Qualifications 
        The Committee periodically reviews with the Board the requisite skills
and characteristics of its members. 3Ms Corporate Governance
Guidelines contain Board Membership Criteria that apply to nominees for
a position on 3Ms Board. The Committee periodically reviews with the
Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board
members given the current Board composition. It is the intent of the
Board that the Board, itself, will be a high performance organization
creating competitive advantage for the Company. To perform as such, the
Board will be comprised of individuals who have distinguished records
of leadership and success in their arena of activity and who will make
substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively represent
the interests of all stockholders. The Committees and the Boards
assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to,
consideration of: 



  
(i) 
Roles and contributions valuable to the business
community;  


  
(ii) 
Personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment,
and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout service on
the Board a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust,
respect, competence, and adherence to the highest ethical standards;  


  
(iii) 
Relevant knowledge and diversity of background and
experience in such things as business, manufacturing, technology,
finance and accounting, marketing, international business, government,
and the like; or 


  
(iv) 
Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has
the time required for preparation, participation, and attendance at all
meetings. 





        In addition to these minimum requirements, the Committee will also
evaluate whether the nominees skills are complementary to the
existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for particular
expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing, technology,
financial, marketing, international, governmental, or other areas of
expertise, and assess the nominees impact on Board dynamics and
effectiveness. 







11 










 Identification, Evaluation, and Selection of Nominees 
        The Committee periodically reviews the appropriate size and composition
of the Board and anticipates future vacancies and needs of the Board.
In the event the Committee recommends an increase in the size of the
Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified nominees
from several sources, including current Board members, a director
search firm, and nominees recommended by stockholders and other
persons. 
        The Committee may from time to time retain a director search firm to
help the Committee identify qualified director nominees for
consideration by the Committee. 
        The Committee evaluates qualified director nominees at regular or
special Committee meetings against the current Board Membership
Criteria described above and reviews qualified director nominees with
the Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board interview
candidates that meet the Board Membership Criteria, and the Committee
selects nominees that best suit the Boards current needs and
recommends one or more of such individuals for
election to the Board. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
        The following table provides information on 3Ms compensation and
reimbursement practices during 2003 for nonemployee directors. 
        In August 2003, the Nominating and Governance Committee
recommended, and the Board approved, an increase in compensation for
nonemployee directors, which became effective August 11,
2003. In developing its recommendations, the Committee was guided by
the following goals: compensation should fairly pay directors for work
required in a company of 3Ms size and scope and compensation should
align directors interests with the long-term interests of
shareowners. The Board increased the annual retainer from $95,000 to
$150,000, and increased the additional retainer for committee chairs
from $5,500 to $7,000, but eliminated the board and committee meeting
fees.

        Nonemployee directors received $95,000 of the total annual retainer of
$150,000 in common stock of the Company pursuant to the terms of the
Companys 1992 Directors Stock Ownership Program. Nonemployee
directors may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of the
foregoing fees payable in cash through a deferred cash or common stock
equivalents account, and fees payable in stock through a deferred
common stock equivalents account. The nonemployee directors also may
elect to receive common stock of the Company at current fair market
value, in lieu of cash retainer. Information regarding accumulated
deferred stock is set forth in the section entitled Common Stock
Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers. Currently, 91 percent
of director compensation is paid in 3M stock. 
        Stock Ownership Guidelines  The Board also approved stock ownership
guidelines that provide that each director should attain over her or
his three-year term an investment position in 3Ms stock (including
deferred stock) equal to two times the annual retainer. All directors
currently meet these stock ownership guidelines, except one director
who has not completed his first three-year term. 
        Matching Gift Program  The nonemployee directors are eligible to
participate in the matching gift program on the same terms as 3M
employees. Under this program, 3M will match up to a total of $5,000 a
year in contributions by the director to institutions of higher
education or public broadcasting organizations approved by 3M. 
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS 
        The Company has a long-standing policy that directors are expected to
attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless extenuating circumstances prevent them
from attending. All directors attended last years Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
        The Audit Committee appointed the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
independent auditors, to audit the consolidated financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries for the year 2004. If the stockholders
do not ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Audit
Committee will reconsider the selection. 
        Audit services provided by the firm in 2003 included audit of
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries;
reviews of interim consolidated financial information; and
consultations on matters related to accounting and financial reporting. 
        PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provided certain audit related and
nonaudit services to the Company during 2003, all of which were
approved by the Audit Committee. 
        Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to attend
the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to questions
and, if they desire, to make a statement. 
        The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the
ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the
Companys independent auditors. Proxies solicited by the Board of
Directors will be voted FOR ratification unless a contrary vote
is specified. 
PROPOSAL NO. 3 PROPOSAL TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED
COMMON STOCK 
        The Companys Board of Directors has approved and recommends that
stockholders approve at the Annual Meeting a proposal to amend
paragraph A of Article FOURTH of the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation (the Certificate) to increase the number of
authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, from
1,500,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares. The Board of Directors
believes that the proposed amendment to the Certificate of
Incorporation shown below is in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders: 
A.  The total number of shares of all classes of stock which
this Corporation shall have authority to issue is 3,010,000,000
consisting of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without par value
and 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per
share. 
        As of February 27, 2004, 944,033,056 shares of common
stock were issued, including 783,967,306 outstanding shares and
160,065,750 shares held by the Company in treasury. Approximately
74,000,000 shares were under option to participants in the Companys
stock option plans with an additional 35,000,000 reserved for issuance
under stockholder approved stock plans. As of the close of business on
February 27, 2004, none of the Companys 10,000,000 shares
of authorized preferred stock have been issued. As a result,
approximately 607,032,700 shares of Common Stock (including
shares held in Treasury) remained available for future corporate
purposes. 
        Reasons for the Proposal: The Board of Directors has
concluded that increasing the number of authorized shares of common
stock will give the Company the ability to respond to growth of the
Companys business that may occur in the future and to react quickly
to todays competitive, fast-changing environment. Although the Board
has no specific plans or commitments for the issuance of any of the
additional shares that would be authorized by the amendment, the Board
believes that the increase in the number of authorized shares will
provide flexibility for future stock splits (effected in the form of a
stock dividend) without the expense of a special stockholder meeting or
waiting until the next annual meeting, and for other actions the
Company might wish to take, such as paying for acquisitions with stock
of the Company, equity offerings to raise capital, and employee benefit
plans. 
        Certain Effects of the Proposal: If stockholders approve the
proposed amendment, the Board of Directors may issue such shares
without further stockholder action except as required by law,
regulation, or applicable stock exchange requirements. The additional
shares, when issued, will have 







16 













the same voting and other rights as the Companys presently authorized
common stock. The holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights
to subscribe for additional shares of common stock. 
        Anti-Takeover Effects and Other Provisions: Although the
Board has no present intention of issuing any additional shares of
common stock as an anti-takeover step, the issuance of additional
common shares could be used to create impediments to or otherwise
discourage persons attempting to gain control of the Company. For
example, the issuance of additional shares could be used in a manner
that would dilute the voting power of shares then outstanding. Shares
of common stock could also be issued to persons or entities that would
support the Board of Directors in opposing a takeover bid which the
Board determines to be not in the best interests of the Company, its
stockholders, and its employees. 
        Effective Date: The Board reserves the right to abandon the
amendment set forth in this Proposal at any time before its
effectiveness whether before or after stockholder approval under
Delaware General Corporation Law §242(c). If approved by the
stockholders and not abandoned by the Board, the amendment would become
effective upon the filing with the Secretary of State of Delaware of a
Certificate of Amendment, which filing is expected to take place
shortly after the stockholders approve the amendment. 
        Vote Required: The affirmative FOR vote by the holders
of a majority of the outstanding common stock entitled to vote is
required to approve this amendment to the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation. 
        The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote
FOR this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors
will be voted FOR this proposal unless a contrary vote is
specified. 
PROPOSAL NO. 4 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL 
        3M has received a stockholder proposal from C. Thomas Keegel (General
Secretary-Treasurer) as representative of stockholder Teamster
Affiliates Pension Plan on behalf of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters Affiliates Pension Plan, 25 Louisiana Avenue, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20001 (the Proponent). The Proponent has
requested the Company to include the following proposal and supporting
statement in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only
if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponents qualified
representative. 
Proponents Proposal: 
RESOLVED: The shareholders of 3M Company, (3M or the
Company) urge the Board of Directors (the Board) to amend the
by-laws to require that an independent director who has not served as
the chief executive of the Company serve as Board Chair. Implementation
will be deferred until the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will
not interfere with any current employment agreement. 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT: 
It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to protect
shareholders interests by providing independent oversight of management, including
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in directing the corporations business and
affairs, The Board exists to ensure that management acts in the best long-term interests
of the shareholders. Currently at 3M, Mr. James McNerney holds the positions of both
Chairman of the Board and CEO. We believe that no single individual can both fill the
position of CEO and, at the same time, provide the necessary leadership and objectivity
required as Chairman of the Board to properly represent the interests of shareholders.
Further, an appearance of a conflicted Board Chair can damage the credibility of the
Company. We believe a clear delineation between the roles of Chair and CEO is necessary
and will promote greater accountability to 3Ms shareholders.







17 










Investors require consistency and stability from the leadership of our
Company. The Company has faced litigation primarily from alleged users
of the Companys respirator mask products and ongoing breast implant
insurance recovery litigation. 3M needs a Chairman that can provide
quality independent oversight of managements performance. 
We believe that separating the positions of Chair and CEO will enhance
independent Board leadership at 3M. Other institutional investors and
corporate governance experts agree: 




  
 
The National Association of Corporate Directors
recommend that Boards designate an independent director as Chair or
lead director to evaluate CEO and Board Chair functions.  


  
 
CalPERS Corporate Governance Guidelines state, The
independence of a majority of the Board is not enough. The leadership
of the board must embrace independence, and must ultimately change the
way in which directors interact with management.  


  
 
 The Ethical Funds and Domini Social Investments Proxy Voting
Guidelines call for a strong independent director as Board Chair to
represent the interests of
stockholders.  





We believe the recent wave of corporate scandals at companies,
such as Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco demonstrate that no matter how many
independent directors there are on the Board, that Board is less likely
to protect shareholder interests by providing independent oversight of
the officers if the Chairman of that Board is also the CEO of the
company. 

We urge
stockholders to vote FOR
this proposal. 
Boards Statement Opposing the Proposal 
        The Board of Directors believes it is fundamentally wrong to
permanently and inflexibly separate or combine the positions of
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. To do so deprives
the Board of the ability to act in the stockholders best interests in
selecting future Board leadership. 
        The Board rejected permanent separation or combination of the positions
of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are
set forth in Appendix A. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that
allows it, in representing the stockholders best interests, to decide
who should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or
anticipated future circumstances. 
        The Proposal appears to presume that a CEO serving also as Chairman
impairs the Boards independence. That is not the case at 3M. The
Board believes that the Companys corporate governance measures ensure
that strong, independent directors will continue to effectively oversee
the Companys management and key issues related to strategy, risk, and
integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide: 




  
 
Independent directors comprise a substantial majority of the
Board. Currently, all but one director is independent.  


  
 
Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation,
Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues Committees. 


  
 
The committee chairs establish their respective agenda.  


  
 
The Board and committees may retain their own advisors.  


  
 
The independent directors meet in executive session without
the CEO or other employees during each regular Board meeting and may
select a director to preside at the meeting. The chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Nominating and Governance, or Public Issues Committees of
the Board may chair executive sessions where the principal items to be
considered are within the scope of the committee chairs authority.  





        The Board currently believes that combining the roles of CEO and
Chairman contributes to a more efficient and effective Board. The
independent directors recruited the current Chairman and CEO from
outside 3M to be its leader in a time of changing and challenging
global economic conditions. The Board believes that to drive change and
continuous improvement within the Company, tempered by respect for
3Ms traditions and values, requires the maximum authority to be
effective. The CEO bears primary responsibility for effectively leading
significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving 







18 













growth, managing the Companys day-to-day business, and reinforcing the
expectation for all employees of continuing to build on 3Ms
century-old tradition of uncompromising honesty and integrity. The
Board currently believes the CEO is the person in the best position to
chair regular Board meetings and is in the best position to bring key
business issues and stakeholder interests to the Boards attention. 
        The Proponent refers to several of the companies involved in the recent
corporate scandals and asserts that companies with a separate chairman
and CEO are better able to protect stockholder interests by providing
independent oversight of the officers. In fact, several of these
companies cited by the Proponent had separated the positions of
chairman and CEO. The failure of corporate governance at those
companies clearly illustrates that separating the chairman and CEO
positions does not necessarily increase the oversight of management or
improve governance and certainly is not as important as setting the
clear tone at the top by an effective CEO. Indeed, in these
instances, separating the roles of chairman and CEO appears to have
been irrelevant. 
        The Board of Directors believes the Companys Bylaws and Corporate
Governance Guidelines provide appropriate flexibility for the selection
of a Chairman, and that the proposal imposes an unnecessary restriction
that is not in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders. 
        The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST this
proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies solicited by the
Board of Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a
stockholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.

FOOTNOTES TO SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 
        (1)  Generally, profit sharing is paid in cash; however, the
Named Executive Officers have in the past, and may in the future,
receive a portion of their profit sharing in restricted shares of the
Companys common stock as determined by the Compensation Committee.
The restricted shares vest at the end of three years or at age 65,
whichever occurs first, or upon death or permanent disability. For
Mr. Ziegler, in 2003 Bonus includes $283,333 of a signing
bonus payable to him in accordance with his employment agreement with
the Company. 
        (2)  Other Annual Compensation includes perquisites or
other personal benefits received by the named individuals to the extent
that the aggregate amount thereof exceeds $50,000, amounts reimbursed
to individuals during the year for payment of taxes and that portion of
interest above market rates (as determined by the SEC) paid on that
compensation voluntarily deferred by the individuals. For 







22 











Mr. McNerney, Other Annual Compensation includes in 2003,
2002, and 2001, $107,833, $114,300, and $154,362, respectively, for the
incremental cost of company-required personal use of corporate
aircraft. In 2003, the Company changed the method of calculating the
value of the personal use of aircraft from imputed income calculated
pursuant to IRS regulations to incremental cost to the Company. 
        (3)  Value as of the date of grant. As of December 31, 2003, Mr. McNerney held 176,000 shares of restricted
stock that had a value of $14,965,280. These shares resulted from a
grant of 220,000 shares of restricted stock made to Mr. McNerney in
accordance with his employment agreement with the Company. These shares
vest in increments of 10 percent on the 1st of January in the years
2002 through 2011 if he remains continuously employed by the Company.
As of December 31, 2003, Mr. Ziegler held 12,000
shares of restricted stock that had a value of $1,020,360. These shares
resulted from a grant of 12,000 shares of restricted stock made to
Mr. Ziegler in accordance with his employment agreement with
the Company. These shares vest in increments of 33-1/3 percent on the
1st of January in the years 2006, 2008, and
2010 if he remains continuously employed by the Company. As of
December 31, 2003, Mr. Campbell held 4,000 shares
of restricted stock that had a value of $340,120. These shares resulted
from a grant of 6,000 shares of restricted stock made to Mr. Campbell in accordance with his employment agreement with the
Company. These shares vest in increments of 33-1/3 percent on the 1st
of February in the years 2003 through 2005 if he remains continuously
employed by the Company. Dividends are paid on this restricted stock to
the same extent and at the same time the Company pays dividends on its
common stock. (For more information about this restricted stock, see
the section entitled Employment Contracts, Termination of
Employment, and Change-in-Control Arrangements). In addition, as of
December 31, 2003, each of the Named Executive Officers held
the following shares of restricted stock having the following values as
a result of profit sharing compensation earned in years prior to 2002:
Mr. McNerney, 17,396 shares having a value of $1,479,182; Dr.
Reich, 688 shares having a value of $58,501; and Mr. Wiens,
894 shares having a value of $76,017. 
        (4)  The number of stock options shown in this column
includes both annual grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options
and Progressive Stock Options, which are described more fully in
footnote 1 to the Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year Table. 
        (5)  All Other Compensation includes: (a) for years
prior to 2003, the dollar value of premiums paid on behalf of the
individual for the term portion of life insurance under the Companys
Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan, and that amount deemed to be
compensation to the individuals under the Companys Senior Executive
Split Dollar Plan in accordance with rules developed by the SEC; (b)
for 2003, the dollar value of premiums paid on behalf of the individual
for term life insurance coverage provided in lieu of coverage under the
Companys Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan, or to reimburse the
individual for premiums paid for life insurance under the Senior
Executive Split Dollar Plan; and (c) all amounts contributed by the
Company to the account of each named executive under the Companys
401(k) plans. During 2003, the only amounts deemed compensation as a
result of premiums paid or reimbursed for life insurance coverage for
the Named Executive Officers were $12,177 for Mr. Ziegler and $8,960
for Mr. Campbell. During 2003, the amounts contributed by the Company
to the accounts of the Named Executive Officers under the Companys
401(k) plans were $51,745 for Mr. McNerney; $6,877 for Mr. Ziegler;
$8,807 for Dr. Reich; $8,807 for Mr. Wiens; and $17,557 for Mr.
Campbell.

Footnotes to Option Grants in Last Fiscal Year
Table 
        (1)  The Company did not grant any stock
appreciation rights (SARs) during 2003. The options shown for
each individual include both annual grants of nonqualified stock
options and grants of Progressive Stock Options (PSOs).
Nonqualified options granted to certain participants are subject to a
reload feature when exercised with the payment of the option price in
the form of previously owned shares of the Companys common stock.
Such an exercise results in further grants of PSOs. The first grant
shown for each individual is the annual grant. The remaining lines are
PSOs. The PSO grants for each individual were made on a single date,
but are, pursuant to SEC rules, shown in multiple lines because of
different expiration dates. 
        PSO grants were made to participants who exercised
nonqualified stock options and who paid the purchase price using shares
of previously owned Company common stock. The PSO grant is for the
number of shares equal to the shares utilized in payment of the
purchase price and tax withholding, if any. The option price for the
PSO is equal to 100 percent of the market value of the Companys
common stock on the date of the exercise of the primary option. The
option period is equal to the remaining period of the options
exercised. 
        The participant must have owned Company common stock used for
payment for at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified
options per participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO
grants by the Compensation Committee. 
        The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of nonqualified
stock options, without foregoing the opportunity for further
appreciation, and promotes retention of the Company stock acquired. 
        In any event, a participant receiving an annual grant of
nonqualified stock options can never acquire more shares of Company
common stock through successive exercises of the primary option and
subsequent PSO grants than the number of shares covered by the primary
annual option grant from the Committee. 
        (2)  All options granted during the period were
granted at the market value on the date of grant, as calculated from
the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Index. The option price shown for the All
Optionees line is $62.294 and represents the weighted average
exercise price of the options granted in 2003. 
        (3)  The expiration date for the All Optionees line is
shown as May 13, 2013, since that is the applicable date for
the vast majority of options granted during 2003. 







24 










        (4)  Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, the Company has
elected to provide a grant date present value for these option grants
determined by a modified Black-Scholes pricing model. The Companys
use of this model should not be construed as an endorsement of its
accuracy at valuing options. All stock option valuation models,
including the Black-Scholes model, require a prediction about the
future movement of the stock price. Among key assumptions utilized in
this pricing model were: (i) that the time of exercise of stock options
would be 66 months (28 months for PSOs) into the term of the option,
which could be for terms as long as ten years, in recognition of the
historical exercise patterns at the Company for these types of options;
(ii) expected volatility of 25.0 percent (24.1 percent for PSOs);
(iii) risk-free rate of return of 4.6 percent (2.6 percent
for PSOs); and (iv) dividend growth rate of 3.2 percent. No
adjustments for nontransferability or risk of forfeiture have been
made. The Company expresses no opinion that the present value will, in
fact, be realized and expressly disclaims any representation to that
effect.

        (1)  The Value Realized or the
unrealized Value of Unexercised In-the-Money Options at FY-End
represents the aggregate difference between the market value on the
date of exercise or at December 31, 2003, in the case of the
unrealized values, and the applicable exercise prices. These
differences accumulate over what may be, in many cases, several years.
These stock options all have option periods of ten years when first
granted, and Progressive Stock Options have option periods equal to the
remaining option period of the primary nonqualified options resulting
in Progressive Stock Options.

FOOTNOTES TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS TABLE 
        (1)  The Companys Performance Unit Plan (the Plan)
provides long-term compensation to approximately 120 key management
personnel based upon the Companys attainment of long-term performance
and growth criteria. 







25 










        The Compensation Committee administers the Plan. The Committee has sole
discretion in the selection of participants, performance criteria, size
of awards, performance period, and the timing and form of payment, as
well as all other conditions regarding awards. 
        Awards made in 2003 under the Performance Unit Plan are based on
performance criteria that focus management attention on two key factors
that create shareholder value: Economic Profit Growth and Improvement
in Net Working Capital Turns. The payout can vary from $0 to $360 per
unit. More detail about current performance goals is available in the
Report of the Compensation Committee. 
        The right to receive payment is contingent upon continued employment to
the payment date, and is subject to forfeiture prior to the payment
date in the event of termination of employment for any reason other
than retirement under a pension plan of the Company, death, or physical
or mental disability. Participants receiving awards during 2003,
including the Named Executive Officers, will receive payment in 2006,
provided that such individuals continue employment with the Company
until such payment date (except in the event of death, retirement, or
disability). Payment under the Plan may be made in cash, shares of the
Companys common stock, or any combination of cash and stock, at the
discretion of the Compensation Committee. In the past, payment has been
made only in cash. 
        (2) The value of awards granted for 2003 will be determined
by the Companys attainment of Economic Profit Growth and Improvement
in Net Working Capital Turns performance criteria during a three-year
performance period of 2003, 2004, and 2005. More detail about current
performance goals is available in the Report of the Compensation
Committee. 
Employment Contracts, Termination of Employment, and
Change-In-Control Arrangements 
Chief Executive Officer 
        3M has entered into an employment agreement with W. James McNerney, Jr.
providing for his employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company
and for his election as Chairman of the Board of 3M. The initial term
of the agreement ends on January 1, 2004, but, beginning on
January 1, 2002, the term automatically extends so that the
remaining term is always two years. The agreement provides for an
initial base salary of $1,300,000 per year and for annual profit
sharing initially designed to pay $2,200,000 per year, depending on the
Companys performance. The agreement also recognizes that Mr. McNerney
will be entitled to participate in the same retirement and welfare
benefit programs that the Company provides to other senior executives. 
        The agreement also required 3M to grant Mr. McNerney the
following stock options, restricted stock, and performance units under
the Performance Unit Plan: 
        Stock Options  Effective December 4, 2000, Mr. McNerney was granted options to purchase 1,200,000 shares of 3M
common stock at $51.525 per share. A portion of these options was
designed to compensate Mr. McNerney for the restricted stock
and stock options he forfeited upon leaving his prior employer. 800,000
of these options become exercisable in increments of 20 percent on the
1st of January in the years 2002 through 2006, and the remaining
400,000 of these options become exercisable in increments of one-third
on the 1st of January in the years 2002 through 2004, in each case
assuming he remains employed by the Company. All 1,200,000 options will
become exercisable in full immediately upon termination of Mr.
McNerneys employment by reason of death or disability, termination
without cause, a termination for good reason, or a change in control of
the Company. 
        Restricted Stock  In order to compensate Mr. McNerney for
the restricted stock and stock options he forfeited upon leaving his
prior employer, the Company also granted Mr. McNerney 220,000 shares of restricted stock. These shares of restricted stock vest
in increments of 10 percent on the 1st of January in the years 2002
through 2011, assuming he remains employed by the Company, although
such vesting accelerates in the event of the termination of Mr.
McNerneys employment by reason of death or disability, termination
without cause, a termination for good reason, or a change in control of
the Company. 
        Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. McNerney 10,000
performance units for the performance period commencing January 1, 2001, and ending December 31, 2003, subject to the 







26 













terms of the Companys Performance Unit Plan. The value of these units
and the amount paid to Mr. McNerney will depend on the
performance of the Company, but in no event will the value be less than
$100 per unit nor more than $200 per unit. 
        The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. McNerney
supplemental retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at
least ten years, the supplemental benefits will be equal in value to an
annuity payable for his lifetime commencing at age 62 and based on 50
percent of his highest average annual compensation over a three-year
period. If Mr. McNerney is employed by 3M for less than ten years, the
amount of these supplemental retirement benefits will be prorated
accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be reduced by the amount
of his benefits under 3Ms pension plans or the pension plans of his
prior employer. These supplemental retirement benefits vest after five
years of employment with the Company, although they vest immediately in
the event of the termination of his employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, a termination for good reason,
or a change in control of the Company. 
        In the event that Mr. McNerneys employment is terminated by the
Company other than for cause, or if Mr. McNerney terminates
his employment for good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum cash
payment equal to three times his annual base salary and profit sharing.
As a condition to receiving such payment, Mr. McNerney would
be required to sign a release of all claims against the Company. 
Chief Financial Officer 
        3M has also entered into an employment agreement with Patrick D.
Campbell providing for his employment as Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The term of this agreement
began on February 1, 2002, and ends on February 1,
2005. If Mr. Campbells employment with the Company continues beyond
February 1, 2005, his employment would be governed by the
same terms and conditions that apply to other similar executives of the
Company. The agreement provides for an initial base salary of $450,000
per year and for annual profit sharing initially designed to pay
$300,000 per year, depending on the Companys performance. The
agreement also recognizes that Mr. Campbell will be entitled
to participate in certain retirement and welfare benefit programs that
the Company provides to other senior executives, and will be entitled
to reimbursement of his reasonable relocation expenses. For purposes of
3Ms postretirement medical program, Mr. Campbell will be
credited with an opening retiree medical credit balance as if he had
completed 12 years of service with the Company. 
        The agreement also required 3M to grant Mr. Campbell the
following stock options, restricted stock, and performance units under
the Performance Unit Plan: 
        Stock Options  Effective February 1, 2002, Mr. Campbell was granted options to purchase 48,000 shares of 3M common
stock at $55.965 per share. These options become exercisable in
increments of one-third on the 1st of February in the years 2003
through 2005, assuming he remains employed by the Company. All 48,000
options will become exercisable in full immediately upon termination of
Mr. Campbells employment by reason of death or disability,
termination without cause, or termination for good reason, and in that
event such options shall remain exercisable for up to two years
following Mr. Campbells death, the termination of his employment due
to disability, termination without cause, or termination for good
reason. In addition, any portion of these 48,000 options that have
already become exercisable may be exercised by Mr. Campbell
within 90 days following his resignation from the Company without good
reason. 
        In May 2002, Mr. Campbell was granted options to purchase 40,000 shares
of 3M common stock at $64.50 per share. All 40,000 options will become
exercisable in full immediately upon termination of Mr. Campbells
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause,
or termination for good reason, and in that event such options shall
remain exercisable for up to two years following Mr. Campbells death,
the termination of his employment due to disability, termination
without cause, or termination for good reason. In addition, any portion
of these 40,000 options that have already become exercisable may be
exercised by Mr. Campbell within 90 days following his resignation from
the Company without good reason. 
        Restricted Stock  The Company also granted Mr. Campbell 6,000 shares
of restricted stock. These shares vest in increments of one-third on
the 1st of February in the years 2003 through 2005, 







27 










assuming he remains employed by the Company, although such vesting
accelerates in the event of termination of Mr. Campbells employment
by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason. 
        Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. Campbell 2,400 performance
units for the performance period commencing January 1, 2002, and ending
December 31, 2004, subject to the terms of the Companys Performance
Unit Plan. These units will vest at the end of such three-year
performance period, assuming he remains employed by the Company,
although such vesting accelerates in the event of termination of Mr.
Campbells employment by reason of death or disability, termination
without cause, or termination for good reason. The value of these units
and the amount paid to Mr. Campbell will depend on the
performance of the Company, although in the event that the vesting of
such units accelerates due to the termination of Mr. Campbells
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause,
or termination for good reason, the value of such units is limited to
their par value ($120 per unit) multiplied by the ratio of the number
of days he was employed by the Company to the total number of days
between February 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004. 
        The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. Campbell supplemental
retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at least ten
years, the supplemental benefits will be payable in the form of an
annuity payable for his lifetime commencing at age 60 and based on 45
percent of his highest average annual compensation over a four-year
period. If Mr. Campbell is employed by 3M for less than ten years, the
amount of these supplemental retirement benefits will be prorated
accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be reduced by the amount
of his benefits under 3Ms pension plans and the pension plans of his
prior employer. Once he has completed two years of employment with 3M,
the sum of these supplemental retirement benefits and the benefits
payable under 3Ms pension plans will not be less than $100,000 per
year. These supplemental retirement benefits (other than the $100,000
minimum benefit, which vests after two years of employment with the
Company) vest after five years of employment with the Company, although
they vest immediately in the event of the termination of his employment
by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason. 
        In the event that Mr. Campbells employment is terminated by the
Company other than for cause, or if Mr. Campbell terminates his
employment for a good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum payment
equal to (i) two times his annual base salary and profit sharing if
such termination occurs during the first five years following his
employment commencement date, or (ii) one times his annual base salary
and profit sharing if such termination occurs more than five but no
more than ten years following his employment commencement date. As a
condition to receiving such payment, Mr. Campbell would be
required to sign a release of all claims against the Company. 
Senior Vice President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel 
        3M has also entered into an employment agreement with Richard F.
Ziegler providing for his employment as Senior Vice President, Legal
Affairs and General Counsel of the Company. The term of this agreement
began on January 1, 2003, and ends on January 1, 2006. If Mr.
Zieglers employment with the Company continues beyond January 1,
2006, his employment would be governed by the same terms and conditions
that apply to other similar executives of the Company. The agreement
provides for an initial base salary of $600,000 per year and for annual
profit sharing initially designed to pay $400,000 per year, depending
on the Companys performance. The agreement also recognizes that
Mr. Ziegler will be entitled to participate in the same
retirement and welfare benefit programs that the Company provides to
its other similarly situated executives, and will be entitled to
reimbursement of his reasonable relocation expenses. For purposes of
3Ms postretirement medical program, Mr. Ziegler will be credited with
an opening retiree medical credit balance as if he had completed 13
years of service with the Company. 
        The agreement also required 3M to pay Mr. Ziegler the following cash
bonus and to grant him the following stock options, restricted stock,
and performance units under the Performance Unit Plan: 
        Cash Bonus  The agreement provides for a cash-signing bonus in the
amount of $850,000, payable in equal installments on the 1st of January
in the years 2003 through 2005, assuming Mr. Ziegler remains
employed by the Company. Any unpaid installments would become payable
in full 







28 













immediately upon the termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by reason
of death or disability, termination without cause, termination for good
reason, or a change in control of the Company. 
        Stock Options  In May 2003, Mr. Ziegler was granted options to
purchase 46,000 shares of 3M common stock at $61.85 per
share. All 46,000 options will become exercisable in full immediately
upon termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, or termination for good reason,
and in that event such options shall remain exercisable for up to two
years following Mr. Zieglers death, the termination of his employment
due to disability, termination without cause, or termination for good
reason. In addition, any portion of these 46,000 options that have
already become exercisable may be exercised by Mr. Ziegler within 90
days following his resignation from the Company without good reason. 
        Restricted Stock  The Company also granted Mr. Ziegler 12,000 shares
of restricted stock. These shares vest in increments of one-third on
the 1st of January in the years 2006, 2008, and 2010, assuming he
remains employed by the Company, although such vesting accelerates in
the event of termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by reason of
death or disability, termination without cause, termination for good
reason, or a change in control of the Company. 
        Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. Ziegler 2,400 performance
units for the performance period commencing January 1, 2003, and ending
December 31, 2005, subject to the terms of the Companys Performance
Unit Plan. These units will vest at the end of such three-year
performance period, assuming he remains employed by the Company,
although such vesting accelerates in the event of termination of Mr.
Zieglers employment by reason of death or disability, termination
without cause, or termination for good reason. The value of these units
and the amount paid to Mr. Ziegler will depend on the performance of
the Company, although in the event that the vesting of such units
accelerates due to the termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by
reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason, the value of such units is limited to
their par value ($120 per unit) multiplied by the ratio of the number
of days he was employed by the Company to the total number of days
between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2005. 
        The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. Ziegler supplemental
retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at least nine
years, the supplemental benefits will be payable in the form of an
annuity payable for his lifetime commencing at age 62 and based on 45
percent of his highest average annual compensation over a four-year
period. If Mr. Ziegler is employed by 3M for less than nine years, the
amount of these supplemental retirement benefits will be prorated
accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be reduced by the amount
of his benefits under 3Ms pension plans. Once he has completed two
years of employment with 3M, the sum of these supplemental retirement
benefits and the benefits payable under 3Ms pension plans will not be
less than $300,000 per year. These supplemental retirement benefits
(other than the $300,000 minimum benefit, which vests after two years
of employment with the Company) vest after five years of employment
with the Company, although they vest immediately in the event of the
termination of his employment by reason of death or disability,
termination without cause, or termination for good
reason. 
        In the event that Mr. Zieglers employment is terminated by the
Company other than for cause, or if Mr. Ziegler terminates his
employment for a good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum payment
equal to (i) two times his annual base salary and profit sharing if
such termination occurs during the first three years following his
employment commencement date, or (ii) one times his annual base salary
and profit sharing if such termination occurs more than three but no
more than ten years following his employment commencement date. As a
condition to receiving such payment, Mr. Ziegler would be required to
sign a release of all claims against the Company. 
Retirement Benefits 
        The Company maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan for
its eligible employees in the United States. Effective January 1, 2001,
the Company amended this plan (the Employee Retirement Income Plan, or
the ERIP) to include a pension equity feature for (1) employees
hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who
voluntarily elected the pension equity feature during the one-time
choice election period in 2001. Of the Named Executive Officers, Dr.
Reich and Mr. Wiens participate in the non-pension equity portion of
the ERIP (the Portfolio I Pension Plan), 







29 













while Mr. McNerney, Mr. Ziegler, and Mr. Campbell participate in the
pension equity portion of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Pension Plan).
Retirement benefits under the ERIP are based on an employees years of
service and average annual earnings during the employees highest four
consecutive years of service. Since the Internal Revenue Code limits
the amount of benefits that can be paid from the ERIP as well as the
amount of compensation upon which such benefits may be earned, the
Company also maintains several nonqualified pension plans for eligible
employees. The following table shows the estimated annual benefits
payable on retirement under both the ERIP and these nonqualified plans
to the Companys eligible employees in the United States.

FOOTNOTES TO PENSION PLAN TABLES 
        (1)  Earnings include base salary and profit sharing
actually earned by the participant and does not include any other forms
of remuneration. The benefits are computed on the basis of
straight-life annuity amounts and are not subject to any deduction for
social security or other offset amounts. 
        (2)  Under the Portfolio I plan, a participant may retire
with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after
1942) and if the participants age and years of service total at least
90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942) he or she would receive a
social security bridge to age 62. Under the Portfolio II plan, a
participant may retire anytime after age 55 with at least five years of
service and their pension is based on the total pension value
determined at retirement converted to an actuarially equivalent
annuity. The Named Executive Officers are presently entitled to the
respective years of service credit set opposite their names:

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
        The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
Committee) reviews the Companys compensation practices and
policies, annually reviews and approves (subject to ratification by the
independent directors of the Board) the compensation of the Chief
Executive Officer, annually reviews and approves the compensation for
the other senior executives, evaluates the performance of the Chief
Executive Officer, and annually prepares this report on executive
compensation for inclusion in the proxy statement. The Committees
membership is determined by the Board of Directors, and is composed
solely of independent nonemployee directors. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Practices 
        The Board believes that providing appropriate motivation of the
Companys executives and effective leadership are essential for
establishing 3Ms preeminence in the markets we serve and creating an
attractive investment for stockholders. The Committee is responsible to
the Board for ensuring that Company executives are highly qualified and
are compensated in a manner that aligns the interests of executives and
stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the following core
principles provide a framework for the Companys executive
compensation programs: 



  
 
Total compensation must be competitive to attract the best
talent to 3M; motivate employees to perform at their highest levels;
reward outstanding achievement; and retain those individuals with the
leadership abilities and skills necessary for building long-term
stockholder value;  


  
 
A significant portion (targeted at 65 percent to 89 percent)
of an executives total compensation is variable and at risk and tied
to both the annual and long-term financial performance of the Company,
such as economic profit and stock price appreciation; and  


  
 
Stock ownership is emphasized so that executives manage from
an owners perspective. The Committee believes that broad and deep
employee stock ownership effectively aligns the interests of employees
with those of stockholders and strongly motivates executives to build
stockholder value. The Committee has established specific stock
ownership guidelines for key management employees and has created
programs that encourage employees to have an ownership interest in the
Company.  






        The Committee annually surveys the executive compensation practices of
large industrial companies that are likely competitors for executive
talent. The Committees objective of maintaining the total
compensation at a competitive level has resulted in short-term
compensation (base salary and profit sharing) being at or very close to
the median and long-term compensation (Performance Unit Plan and stock
options) in the 50th to 75th percentile, with more variability and risk
based on Company performance. 
        Executive compensation is linked to Company performance compared to
specific financial and nonfinancial objectives. These objectives range
from achieving earnings and sales growth targets to upholding the
Companys Statement of Corporate Values (which include customer
satisfaction through superior quality and value, attractive investor
return, ethical business conduct, respect for the environment, and
employee pride in the Company). 
Components of Executive Compensation 
        The compensation program for executive officers consists of the
following components: base salary, profit sharing, Performance Unit
Plan, stock options, and (in appropriate circumstances) restricted
stock. The Committee determines the amount of compensation under each
component of executive compensation granted to the executive officers
to achieve the appropriate ratio between performance-based compensation
and other forms of compensation, and to reflect the level of
responsibility of the executive officer. 


31 










        Base Salary 
        The Committee establishes base salaries annually in relation to base
salaries paid by companies included in the compensation surveys. Base
salary for an executive officer is established each year based on (1) a
compensation range corresponding to the executives responsibilities
and (2) the executives overall individual job performance. 
        Profit Sharing 
        Profit sharing is variable compensation based on the quarterly economic
profit of the Company and its business units. Economic profit is
defined as quarterly net operating income minus a charge for operating
capital used by the business. The economic profit measurement is
directly related to the creation of stockholder value since it
emphasizes the effective use of capital and solid profitable growth.
Compensation paid under the profit sharing plan fluctuates based on
Company performance. 
        The amount payable under this plan is based on the number of shares of
profit sharing assigned to a participant, multiplied by an amount based
on quarterly economic profit. The total amount paid under this plan to
the Companys five most highly compensated executive officers never
exceeds one-half percent of the Companys consolidated net income for
any period, and no single executive officer ever receives more than
one-sixth percent of the Companys consolidated net income for any
period. Profit sharing payments to these individuals are subject to
limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to
planned compensation. 
        Currently, all profit sharing payments are made in cash. However, the
plan does permit the Committee to pay all or a portion of the profit
sharing payable to the Named Executive Officers in shares of the
Companys common stock. 
        Performance Unit Plan 
        The Performance Unit Plan is variable compensation based on the
Companys long-term performance. The amount payable with respect to
each performance unit granted is determined by and is contingent upon
attainment of the performance criteria selected each year by the
Compensation Committee over the applicable three-year performance
period (each year weighted equally). 
        The performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee for
performance units granted during 2003 were designed to focus management
attention on two key factors that create shareholder value: Economic
Profit Growth and Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns. 
        Performance Criteria:
        (1)  Economic Profit Growth is the percentage amount by which the
Economic Profit of the Company for a year exceeds the Economic Profit
of the Company for the immediately preceding year; and 
        (2)  Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns is the percentage
amount by which the Net Working Capital Turns of the Company for a year
increases from the Net Working Capital Turns for the immediately
preceding year; where the term Net Working Capital Turns means
the Companys net sales during the fourth quarter of a year multiplied
by four, and divided by the Companys Net Working Capital as of the
end of such year; and where the term Net Working Capital means
the sum of the Companys accounts receivable and inventories, minus
the Companys accounts payable. 
        Performance Unit Plan Payments:
        The amount payable for each performance unit granted in 2003 is linked
to the performance criteria of Economic Profit Growth and Improvement
in Net Working Capital Turns. The amount payable may be anywhere from
$0 to $360 per unit, depending on the performance of the Company during
the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2005. Payment
for the units granted in 2003 will be made no later than June 2006, in
the form (at the discretion of the Committee) of cash, stock, or a
combination of cash and stock. 
Stock Options and Restricted Stock 
        The objectives of the Management Stock Ownership Program are to help
the Company attract and retain outstanding employees, and to promote
the growth and success of the Companys business by 







32 













aligning the financial interests of these employees with the other
stockholders of the Company. The Program authorizes the Committee to
grant stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and
other stock awards to employees of the Company. Currently, the
Committee makes annual grants of stock options under the Program to the
executive officers. These options have an exercise price equal to the
market price of the Companys common stock on the grant date, and
generally expire ten years after the grant date. Stock options
encourage executives to become owners of the Company, which further
aligns their interests with those of the stockholders. These options
only have value to the recipients if the price of the Companys stock
appreciates after the options are granted. Currently, the Committee has
made grants of restricted stock under the Program only to selected
executive officers in appropriate circumstances. These circumstances
have included the hiring of new executive officers as well as the need
to retain current executive officers. These shares of restricted stock
vest over periods ranging from one to ten years after the grant date,
which encourage the executives to remain employed by the Company until
the shares have vested. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
        The Companys stock ownership guidelines are designed to increase an
executives equity stake in 3M and more closely align his or her
interests with those of our stockholders. The guidelines provide that
the CEO should attain an investment position in 3Ms stock equal to
five times his or her annual base salary, Executive and Senior Vice
Presidents should attain an investment position in 3Ms stock equal to
three times their annual base salary, and Vice Presidents who are
members of 3Ms Quarterly Management Council should attain an
investment position in 3Ms stock equal to two times their annual base
salary. While the stock ownership guidelines provide that executives
attain these investment positions in 3M stock within five years of
their appointment to these positions, most of our executives have
already attained or exceeded these investment positions. 
Chief Executive Officer Compensation 
        Effective January 1, 2001, the Company hired W. James McNerney, Jr., as
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and entered into an
employment agreement. In determining Mr. McNerneys compensation, the
Board focused on competitive levels of compensation for CEOs managing
companies of similar size and complexity and the importance of hiring a
chief executive officer with the strategic, financial, and leadership
skills to ensure the continued growth and success of the Company. 
        In his third year as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
Mr. McNerney continued to demonstrate strong leadership and vision for
the Company. He continued the implementation of five initiatives (Six
Sigma, Global Sourcing Effectiveness, 3M Acceleration, Indirect Cost
Reduction, and e-Productivity) that strengthen 3M and enhance its
competitiveness. 
        The compensation of Mr. McNerney is governed by his employment
agreement and generally consists of the same short-term and long-term
components (base salary, profit sharing, Performance Unit Plan, and
stock options) as those of other Named Executive Officers. A higher
portion of Mr. McNerneys total compensation is variable and
at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures of the Companys
performance. These measures are Economic Profit, Economic Profit
Growth, and Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns, as defined above,
and appreciation in the value of 3M stock. 
        In order to compensate Mr. McNerney for the restricted stock and stock
options he forfeited upon leaving his prior employer, the Company also
granted Mr. McNerney 220,000 shares of restricted stock. These shares
of restricted stock vest in increments of ten percent on the 1st of
January in the years 2002 through 2011, assuming he remains employed by
the Company, although such vesting accelerates in the event of the
termination of Mr. McNerneys employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, a termination for good reason,
or a change in control of the Company. 
        The terms of Mr. McNerneys employment agreement appear under
Employment Contract, Termination of Employment, and
Change-In-Control Arrangements of this proxy statement. 
Limit on Tax Deductible Compensation 
        Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits the Company from
deducting compensation paid in any year to certain executives in excess
of $1 million but does not subject performance-based compensation to
this limit. The Committee continues to emphasize performance-based
compensation 







33 













for executives and thus minimize the effect of Section 162(m). However,
the Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a
compensation program that attracts, retains, and rewards the executive
talent necessary for the Companys success. Consequently, in any year
the Committee may authorize nonperformance-based compensation in excess
of $1 million. The Committee recognizes that the loss of the tax
deduction may be unavoidable under these circumstances. 
Conclusion 
        The Committee is satisfied that the short-term and long-term
compensation paid to the executive officers of the Company is aligned
with the Companys strategic objectives and ensures that payouts are
determined by Company and employee performance.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
        The members of the Compensation Committee are named in the preceding
section. No members of the Compensation Committee were officers or
employees of 3M or any of its subsidiaries during the year, were
formerly 3M officers, or had any relationship otherwise requiring
disclosure. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
        The role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in
its oversight of the Companys financial reporting process. The Board
of Directors, in its business judgment, has determined that all members
of the Committee are independent, as required by applicable
listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC
rules. In addition, the Board has determined that the Chair of
the Committee, Edward M. Liddy, is both independent and an
audit committee financial expert as defined by SEC rules. The
Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, a copy of which is
set forth in Appendix B. As set forth in the Charter,
management of the Company is responsible for the preparation,
presentation, and integrity of the Companys financial statements, the

        Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and
subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the
Committee referred to in the Charter, the Committee recommended to the

Audit Committee Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible
Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors 
        The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing and overseeing the
work of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has established
the following procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and
permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. 
        Before engagement of the independent auditor for the next years
audit, the independent auditor will submit a detailed description of
services expected to be rendered during that year for each of the
following categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
        1.  Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation of
consolidated financial statements, as well as work that generally only
the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide,
including comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services and
consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards. 
        2.  Audit related services
are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed
by the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers
and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures
required to meet certain regulatory requirements. 
        3.  Tax services include all services performed by the independent
auditors tax personnel except those services specifically related to
the audit of the financial statements, and includes fees in the areas
of tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. 
        4.  Other services are those services not captured in the other
categories. 
        Before engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by
category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee
requires the independent auditor to report actual fees versus the
budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During
the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to
engage the independent auditor for additional services not contemplated
in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee
requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent auditor. 
        The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the chair
of the committee. The chair must report, for informational purposes
only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting. 
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FEES 
        The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the audit of the Companys consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003,
and December 31, 2002, and fees billed for other services rendered by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during those periods.

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH 
        The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total stockholder
return for 3M common stock (assuming reinvestment of dividends) against
the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA), both of which are well-known and published industry
indices. The Company is included in both the S&P 500 Stock Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial group of 30 companies. The Company,
as a highly diversified manufacturer and seller of a broad line of
products, is not easily categorized with other, more specific, industry
indices. 
        The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are
based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in 3M stock and
each index on December 31, 1998, as required by SEC rules,
and that all quarterly dividends were reinvested at the average of the
closing stock prices at the beginning and end of the quarter. The total
cumulative dollar returns shown on the graph represent the value that
such investments would have had on December 31, 2003.

APPENDIX A

3M CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES 






A. 
  

THE ROLES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT 






1. 
  
The Board of Directors  The business of the Company is
conducted under the oversight of the Board of Directors. The Board
selects the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and delegates to the
CEO the authority and responsibility to manage the Companys
operations. The Board of Directors serves as elected representatives of
the shareholders, acts as an advisor and counselor to the CEO and
senior management, and oversees management performance on behalf of
shareholders. 






2. 
  
Management  The CEO and senior management are responsible
for running the Companys business operations. 






B. 
  
BOARD COMPOSITION AND LEADERSHIP 






1. 
  
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer  The
Board has the authority to decide whether the positions of Chairman and
CEO should be held by the same person and shall determine the best
arrangement for the Company and its shareholders in light of all
relevant and changing circumstances. The Board currently believes that
the same individual should hold the position of Chairman and CEO
(Chairman/CEO). 






2. 
  
Size of the Board  The number of Directors should not
exceed a number that can function efficiently. The Nominating and
Governance Committee considers and makes recommendations to the Board
concerning the appropriate size and needs of the Board. 






3. 
  
Board Independence  The Board believes in having a
substantial majority of independent Directors on the 3M Board. A
Director is independent if the Board affirmatively determines
that the Director has no material relationship with the Company
directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization
that has a relationship with the Company and otherwise meets the
requirements for independence of the listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange. The independent Directors will make the Board decisions
on corporate governance matters. 






4. 
  
Board Membership Criteria  The Nominating and Governance
Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills
and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board
composition. It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will
be a high performance organization creating competitive advantage for
the Company. To perform as such, the Board will be comprised of
individuals who have distinguished records of leadership and success in
their arena of activity and who will make substantial contributions to
Board operations and effectively represent the interests of all
stockholders. The Boards assessment of Board candidates includes, but
is not limited to, consideration of: (i) roles and contributions
valuable to the business community; (ii)
personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and whether the
candidate possesses and maintains throughout service on the Board a
reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect,
competence and adherence to the highest ethical
standards; (iii) relevant
knowledge and diversity of background and experience in such things as
business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing,
international business, government and the like; or (iv) whether the
candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for
preparation, participation and attendance at all meetings. A
Directors qualifications in light of these criteria is considered at
least each time the Director is re-nominated for Board membership. 






5. 
  
Selection of New Director Candidates  The Nominating and
Governance Committee screens and recommends Board candidates to the
Board. 






6. 
  
Director Orientation and Continuing Education  The Company
provides Directors with an orientation and education program to
familiarize them with the Companys business operations and plans,
industry trends and corporate governance practices, as well as ongoing
education on issues facing the Company and on subjects that would
assist the Directors in discharging their duties. 









A-1 










7. 
  
Directors Who Experience Change in Present Job Responsibilities
or Other Relevant Circumstances  When a Directors principal
occupation or business affiliation changes, or other circumstances
arise which may raise questions about the Directors continuing
qualifications in relation to the Board Membership Criteria set forth
above, then the Director will tender her/his resignation, or the
Nominating and Governance Committee will ask for such tender. The
Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the tendered
resignation and recommend to the Board the action to be taken. 






8. 
  
Service On Other For-Profit Boards  Independent Directors
are encouraged to evaluate carefully the time required to serve on
other boards (excluding non-profit) taking into account board
attendance, preparation, participation and effectiveness on these
boards. Independent Directors must advise the Chairman/CEO before
accepting an invitation to serve on another board to enable the Company
to determine whether (i) any regulatory issues or potential conflicts
are raised by the Director accepting such an invitation and (ii) the
Director will have the time required for preparation, participation and
attendance at 3M Board meetings. Independent Directors should not serve
on more than five other boards of public companies in addition to the
Company Board. The current position in excess of these limits will be
in compliance by the end of 2004. 






9. 
  
Retirement Policy  Each nonemployee Director must tender
her/his resignation at the annual meeting following her or his 72nd
birthday. If circumstances dictate, the Nominating and Governance
Committee may ask a Director to continue to serve on the Board past age
72. 






10. 
  
Board Compensation Review  The Nominating and Governance
Committee will periodically receive reports on the status of Board
compensation in relation to other large U.S. companies and is
responsible for recommending to the Board changes in compensation for
nonemployee Directors. 






11. 
  
Boards Interaction with Stakeholders  The Chairman/CEO
is responsible for establishing effective communications with the
Companys stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees,
communities, suppliers, creditors, governments and corporate partners.
It is the policy of the Board that management speaks for the Company.
This policy does not preclude independent Directors from meeting with
stakeholders, but management where appropriate should be present at
such meetings. 






C.
  
BOARD OPERATIONS 






1. 
  
Selection of Agenda Items for Board Meetings  At the first
Board meeting of each year, the Chairman/CEO will propose for the
Boards approval agenda items to be discussed during the course of the
year. Before each meeting, the Chairman/CEO will review proposed agenda
items that fall within the scope of responsibilities of a Board
committee with the chair of that committee and distribute the agenda in
advance to the Board. Any Board member may ask to include items on the
agenda. 






2. 
  
Board Materials Distributed in Advance  Board members
receive materials related to agenda items in advance of Board meetings
so that the Directors may prepare to discuss the items at the meeting.
Sensitive subjects may be discussed at the meeting without distributing
written materials in advance or at the meeting. 






3. 
  
Director Responsibilities  Directors must exercise their
business judgment to act in the best interests of the shareholders and
the Company. In discharging this obligation, Directors reasonably may
rely on the Companys senior executives and its advisors and auditors.
Directors are expected to attend and participate in all meetings of the
Board and of committees on which they serve and to spend the time
needed and prepare for and meet as frequently as necessary to discharge
their responsibilities. 






4. 
  
Board Presentations and Access to Employees  Members of
senior management may be invited to attend part or all of a Board
meeting in order to participate in discussions. Generally, the
executive responsible for an area of the Companys operations the
Board is to consider makes the presentation. Board members have
complete access to all other members of management and Company
employees. 








A-2 










5. 
  
Board Access to Independent Advisors  The Board and its
committees may seek advice from outside advisors as appropriate. The
Board shall have sole authority to approve related fees and retention
terms. 






6. 
  
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors  Independent
Directors regularly meet without the Chairman/CEO and may select a
Director to facilitate the meeting. The chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues Committees
of the Board may chair executive sessions of the independent Directors
at which the principal items to be considered are within the scope of
the committee chairs authority. The Board believes that this practice
ensures leadership at all executive sessions of the independent
Directors without needing to designate a lead Director.






D 
  
BOARD COMMITTEES






1. 
  
Committees  The current committees are Audit,
Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues. 






2. 
  
Assignment and Term of Service of Committee Members  The
Board is responsible for the appointment of committee members and
chairs, based on recommendations of the Nominating and Governance
Committee. The Board at its first meeting following the annual meeting
of stockholders shall elect the members of each Committee. 






3. 
  
Agenda, Frequency, Length and Reports of Committee Meetings
 The chair of each committee approves the agenda, length of and
attendance at each committee meeting and determines the frequency of
meetings. Materials related to agenda items are given to the committee
members sufficiently in advance to allow the members to prepare for
discussing the items at the meeting. The committee chairs report a
summary of their meeting to the Board following each regular committee
meeting. 






4. 
  
Membership  All Board members may serve on the Public
Issues Committee, but only independent Directors may serve on the
Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees. 






5. 
  
Responsibilities  The Board periodically reviews the
responsibilities of each committee and approves the committee charters,
copies of which are attached to these
Guidelines. 






E. 
  
BOARD AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION






1. 
  
Formal Evaluation of the Chairman/CEO  The Compensation
Committee, in consultation with the Chairman/CEO, sets annual and
long-term performance goals for the Chairman/CEO. The Chair of the
Compensation Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEOs
performance against such goals with the independent Directors and
communicates the Boards evaluation to the Chairman/CEO. The
Compensation Committee will use the evaluation when determining the
compensation of the Chairman/CEO. 






2. 
  
Board Self-Assessment  The Board will conduct an annual
self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are
functioning effectively. The Nominating and Governance Committee will
receive comments from all Directors and share those comments with the
Board. Based on the comments and further discussion, the Board will
make an assessment specifically reviewing areas in which the Board
and/or the management believe improvements could be made to increase
the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. 






3. 
  
Succession Planning  The Board plans the succession to the
position of Chairman/CEO and certain other senior management positions.
To assist the Board, the Chairman/CEO annually assesses senior managers
and their succession potential. The Chairman/CEO also provides the
Board with an assessment of persons considered potential successors to
certain senior management positions. 






4. 
  
Management Development  The Chairman/CEO annually should
report to the Board on the Companys program for management
development. 








A-3 










Policy on Adoption of a Rights Plan 
        In 2002 and 2003, Mr. Nick Rossi, a 3M stockholder, submitted a
shareholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting
a stockholders rights plan (also known as a poison pill). 3M
does not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting
one. The Board continues to believe, however, that there may be
circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would be necessary
to give the Board the negotiating power and leverage to obtain the best
result for 3M stockholders in the context of a takeover effort. 
        Following consideration of the favorable vote Mr. Rossis proposal
received in the past two years and in light of this belief, the Board
has adopted and reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The
Boards policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either (1)
stockholders have approved adoption of the rights plan or (2) the Board
in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, including a majority
of the independent members of the Board, makes a determination that,
under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best
interests of 3Ms stockholders to adopt a rights plan without the
delay in adoption that would come from the time reasonably anticipated
to seek stockholder approval. 
        The Board has directed the Nominating and Governance Committee to
review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the
Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The
terms of the policy, as in effect, will be included in 3Ms published
Corporate Governance Guidelines and its proxy statement.
