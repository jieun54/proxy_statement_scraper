Abbott Laboratories Proxy Statement

  
 
   Solicitation of Proxies     

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 26, 2013, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 15, 2013. 

 
 
  Information about the Annual Meeting     
 
  Who Can Vote     

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2013 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2013, Abbott had 1,570,677,029
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
 
 
  Notice and Access     

In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's e-proxy rules, Abbott mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to certain shareholders in
mid-March of 2013. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how the shareholders can access the proxy materials online. It also provides instructions on
how those shareholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a print version of the proxy materials, unless you request one. If you would like to receive a print
version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
 
 
  Cumulative Voting     

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees,
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
 
 
  Voting by Proxy     

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. Abbott's By-Laws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at
the meeting. Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The
instructions for voting can be found with your proxy card or on the Notice. 
 
 
  Revoking a Proxy     

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 

by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott,
by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or
by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 
 
 
  Discretionary Voting Authority     

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 11 nominees named in
Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 11 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders,
such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees
(or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive
compensation, or the approval of the shareholder proposals, or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified.
Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, and AGAINST the
shareholder proposals. 
With
the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may
properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 

1

 

 
 
  Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy     

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
 
 
  Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions     

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and
entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the
ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors, the
advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, and the shareholder proposals are considered "non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination
of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on
that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
 
 
  Inspectors of Election     

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
 
 
  Cost of Soliciting Proxies     

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
 
  Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan     

Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive a voting instruction card for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust
is administered by both a trustee and an investment committee. The trustee of the Trust is Mercer Trust Company. The members of the investment committee are Stephen R. Fussell and Valentine Yien,
employees of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the investment committee and the participants. The investment committee must solicit voting instructions
from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The investment committee may use its own discretion with respect to those shares for which no voting instructions are received. 
 
 
  Confidential Voting     

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 

where
disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
where
disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims,
where
a shareholder provides comments with a proxy,
where
a shareholder expressly requests disclosure,
to
allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or
in
other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors. 

 
 
  Information Concerning Security Ownership     

The table below reports the number of common shares beneficially owned as of December 31, 2012, by BlackRock, Inc. (directly or through its subsidiaries) the only person known to Abbott
to own beneficially more than 5% of Abbott's outstanding common shares. It is based on information contained in a Schedule 13G filed by BlackRock, Inc., with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 8, 2013. BlackRock, Inc. reports it has sole voting and investment power with respect to these shares.

The Board of Directors and its Committees     
 
  The Board of Directors     

The board of directors held eight meetings in 2012. The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 2012 was ninety-eight percent and each director attended at least
seventy-five percent of the total number of board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. Abbott encourages its board members to attend the annual shareholders
meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern, R. S. Austin, S. E. Blount, W. J.
Farrell, H. L. Fuller, E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn, S. C. Scott III, and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the board applied the categorical
standards attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that
none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or
entities to which Abbott sold products or made contributions or from which Abbott purchased products and services during the year. In making its determination, the board relied on both information
provided by the directors and information developed internally by Abbott. 
The
board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. 
The
board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of chairman and chief executive officer are held by one individual and an independent director acts as lead
director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of Abbott and its
shareholders. 
Currently,
the chairman of the nominations and governance committee acts as the lead director to facilitate communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the
independent directors or sessions where the chairman of the board is not present. It is the role of the lead director to review and approve matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and,
where appropriate, information provided to other board members. The lead director is chosen by and from the independent members of the board of directors, and serves as the liaison between the
chairman and the independent directors; however, all directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chairman on each of the above topics, as well. The lead director, and each of the
other directors, communicates regularly with the chairman and chief executive officer regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters. The lead director also has the authority to
call meetings of the independent directors and, if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication. 
Abbott
directors have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Director nominees are considered on the basis
of a range of criteria including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective
and commitment to good corporate citizenship. They must have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board's oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each
director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the board to conclude that the director should serve on the board. The directors' biographies are on pages 4
to 7. 
 
 
  Committees of the Board of Directors     

The board of directors has five committees established in Abbott's By-Laws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and
public policy committee. Each of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee is independent. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, R. S. Austin, W. J. Farrell, P. N. Novakovic, and W. A. Osborn, did not hold any meetings in 2012. This committee may exercise all the
authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are R. S. Austin, chair, E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry, S. C. Scott III, and G. F. Tilton, held seven meetings in 2012. The committee is governed by a written charter.
This committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process, the quality and
integrity of Abbott's financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance, the performance of Abbott's internal audit function and internal auditors, and
certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. 
Each
of the members of the audit committee is financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. The board of directors has determined that
R. S. Austin, the committee's chair, is an "audit committee financial expert." A copy of the report of the audit committee is on page 46.

The
compensation committee, whose members are W. J. Farrell, chair, R. S. Austin, E. M. Liddy, W. A. Osborn, and S. C. Scott III, held eight meetings in 2012. The committee is governed
by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in carrying out the board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive officers and directors. The
compensation committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the board and gives its recommendations to the full board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should
be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director compensation, the compensation committee takes comparable director fees into account and
reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. 
This
committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate
the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or with the listing
rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of the proxy captioned,
"Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The
compensation committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The committee has engaged Aon Hewitt to provide counsel and
advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Aon Hewitt, and its principal, report directly to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as
needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The committee
determines what variables it will instruct Aon Hewitt to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's
relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The committee negotiates and approves any fees paid
to Aon Hewitt for these services. In 2012, the committee authorized payment of approximately $316,000 to Aon Hewitt for services rendered to the committee relating to executive compensation.
Separately, Abbott management engaged Aon Hewitt to perform and paid approximately $6 million for unrelated services, including actuarial work, pension design and administration, insurance, and
general consulting. The compensation committee was informed about these services, but its formal approval was not requested. A copy of the compensation committee report is on page 22. 
The
nominations and governance committee, whose members are W. A. Osborn, chair, R. J. Alpern, S. E. Blount, W. J. Farrell, and P. N. Novakovic, held two meetings in 2012. The committee is governed by
a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become board members and recommends to the board the nominees for election as directors at the
next annual meeting of shareholders, recommends to the board the persons to be elected as executive officers of Abbott, develops and recommends to the board the corporate governance guidelines
applicable to Abbott, and serves in an advisory capacity to the board and the chairman of the board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major changes in the organizational
structure of Abbott, and the conduct of board activities. The process used by this committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the board of directors depends on the qualities being sought.
From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the committee in identifying individuals qualified to be board members. Board members should have backgrounds that when combined
provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the board of directors, the
nominations and governance committee considers the board's diversity of ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. Board candidates
will be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of
endeavor, as well as a global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board of directors'
oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. 
The
public policy committee, whose members are P. N. Novakovic, chair, R. J. Alpern, S. E. Blount, N. McKinstry, and G. F. Tilton, held four meetings in 2012. The committee is governed by a written
charter. This committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and
governmental affairs and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott. 
 
 
  Communicating with the Board of Directors     

Interested parties may communicate with the board of directors by writing a letter to the chairman of the board, to the chairman of the nominations and governance committee, who acts as the lead
director at the meetings of the independent directors, or to the independent directors c/o Abbott Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, D-364, AP6D, Abbott Park, Illinois
60064-6400 Attention: corporate secretary. The general counsel and corporate secretary regularly forwards to the addressee all letters other than mass mailings, advertisements, and other
materials not relevant to Abbott's business. In addition, directors regularly receive a log of all correspondence received by the company that is addressed to a member of the board and may request any
correspondence on that log.

(1)Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $10,500 for each month of service as a director and $1,000 for each
month of service as a chairman of a board committee, other than the chairman of the audit committee. The chairman of the audit committee receives $1,500 for each month of service as a chairman of that
committee and the other members of the audit committee receive $500 for each month of service as a committee member. 

Fees
earned under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an
independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by the director. The
distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon retirement from the board of directors. The director may
elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to either a guaranteed interest account or to a stock equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in
Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent
of the market value of the related Abbott common stock at year end. Abbott pays the director for any tax owed with respect to the income earned by the trust or any supplemental contributions to the
trust by Abbott. 


(2)The
amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott common share on the
date of grant. 

In
addition to the fees described in footnote 1, the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program provides that each non-employee director elected to the board of directors at
the 


11

 


annual shareholder meeting receives vested restricted stock units having a value of $113,000 (rounded down). In 2012, this was 1,819 units. The non-employee directors receive cash
payments equal to the dividends paid on the Abbott shares covered by the units at the same rate as other shareholders. Upon termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of
Abbott, a non-employee director will receive one Abbott common share for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. 
The
following restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2012: R. J. Alpern, 8,559; R. S. Austin, 16,222;
S. E. Blount, 1,819; W. J. Farrell, 14,333; E. M. Liddy, 3,986; N. McKinstry, 1,819;
P. N. Novakovic, 3,986; W. A. Osborn, 10,476; S. C. Scott III, 12,206; and G. F. Tilton, 12,206. 


(3)The
following options were outstanding as of December 31, 2012: H. L. Fuller, 12,321; N. McKinstry, 6,280; and
P. N. Novakovic, 7,072.
(4)The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan during the year.
(5)Charitable
contributions made by Abbott's non-employee directors are eligible for a matching contribution (up to $25,000 annually). The amounts reported in this column
include charitable matching grant contributions, as follows: S. E. Blount, $12,500; S. C. Scott III, $25,000; and
G. F. Tilton, $25,000. These amounts also include tax payments made primarily in connection with the director's existing trust established under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, as follows: W. J. Farrell, $14,320; and H. L. Fuller, $10,928.

   Executive Compensation     
 
  Compensation Discussion and Analysis
 
  INTRODUCTION     

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes Abbott's (the "Company") executive compensation program in 2012. In particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the
"Committee") and Board of Directors made its compensation decisions for the Company's executives, including the five named officers: Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer;
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer; Richard A. Gonzalez, Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Products Group; Laura J. Schumacher, Executive Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Carlos Alban, Senior Vice President, Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, Global Commercial Operations. 
It
is organized in three primary sections: a description of the pay philosophy the Committee has established for the Company's executive officers; a description of the process the Committee utilizes
to examine performance in the context of executive pay decisions; and lastly, a description of the performance goals and results for each named officer. 
The
Committee believes performance must always be evaluated compared to the goals of the business and assessed in the context of market and business conditions. 
In
2012, Abbott prepared for the launch of AbbVie, a new biopharmaceutical company, and achieved its business performance plan, its two principal goals for the year. 
On
January 1, 2013, Abbott separated its former research-based pharmaceuticals business to create AbbVie, a Fortune 200 biopharmaceutical company. Abbott is now a diversified healthcare company
comprised of four roughly equal-sized businesses: established pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics and nutritional products. 
2012
was again a very successful year for Abbott in what continues to be a challenging global business environment with changing industry dynamics. The Company produced a 20.3 percent total
shareholder return, compared to 10.2 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 16.0 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index over the same time period. 



The
Company achieved record sales of nearly $40 billion, and a 200 basis point improvement in gross margin in 2012, resulting in ongoing earnings-per-share in excess of
the Company's initial guidance range. Abbott also generated record operating cash flow of more than $9 billion, returning approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders in the form of
dividends. Abbott's dividend payout has increased for 40 consecutive years. 
Abbott's
stock price appreciation and dividends generated a 5-year total shareholder return of 37.1 percent, significantly outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a
return of 13.8 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, with a return of 8.6 percent for that same period. At the same time, the Company has remained strategically active to
help ensure the sustainability of its top-tier performance. 



During
2012, the Company continued its expansion in emerging markets, launched numerous new products, and continued to expand margins, particularly in its nutritional products business. In addition,
prior to the launch of AbbVie, Abbott continued to build and augment the proprietary pharmaceutical pipeline. 
 
 
  COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPONENTS OF PAY     

Abbott and its Compensation Committee have established a compensation philosophy that aligns executives' interests with both short- and long-term profitable growth and shareholder returns
and is designed to attract and retain executives whose talent and contributions sustain the profitable growth of the Company. The intent of this philosophy is to directly support achievement of the
Company's primary business strategies and goals, while also aligning executives' performance and rewards with shareholders' interests. Consequently, the Committee believes the vast majority of
executive compensation at Abbott is, by definition therefore, performance-based. 
There
are four primary pay components that make up our executive pay program: base pay, annual bonuses, long-term incentives and benefits. Each serves complementary, but different and
specific purposes. 

14

 
 
 
  Base Pay    
Setting
appropriate levels of base pay ensures Abbott can attract and retain a leadership team that will continue to meet our commitments to customers and patients and sustain profitable growth for
our shareholders. Talented executives have choices of where they work, and our base pay rates need to be competitive in the context of total compensation. 
 
 
  Annual Bonus    
Abbott's
annual bonus (short-term incentive) is intended to align executives' interests directly with the annual operating strategies, financial goals, and leadership requirements of the
business. It provides a direct link between executives' short-term incentives and the Company's annual performance results through both measurable financial and operational performance and
subjective assessments of strategic progress. Some goals, strategies, and leadership requirements may apply to all executives and as such, may be corporate priorities that are shared by all executive
officers in any given year (for example, earnings per share targets in 2012, as will be disclosed later). Measurable financial goals apply to some executives, reflecting their specific areas of
responsibility. 
Most
executives also carry strategic or leadership-oriented goals, which require qualitative, subjective assessment of their progress during the year. Finally, the process allows for Committee
discretion, since many goals, especially for certain positions, cannot be reduced to formulaic, numerical targets, or anticipated in advance. By definition, therefore, short-term
incentives directly tie executives' pay with both company and individual results allowing for Committee discretion to address unforeseen developments. In the aggregate, short-term
incentives should be paid roughly at target when results are substantially met, below target if not substantially met, and above target if substantially exceeded. 
 
 
  Long-Term Incentives    
Long-term
incentives serve two primary purposes: first, to directly align the largest component of executive pay with shareholders' direct, long-term interests; and secondly,
to help ensure continued performance success through effective focus and retention of executive talent. Executives' interests are directly aligned with those of shareholders in two
ways  first, through direct stock ownership. Executives, as shareholders, benefit from the results they create for other shareholders. Secondly, the level of awards executives
receive vary, by plan design and each executive's individual performance, as reviewed by the Committee. The Committee considers, among other factors, measures that either directly track shareholder
returns or operating or strategic results which lead to the creation or loss of shareholder value. Awards are further differentiated based on each executive's specific contribution to
long-term strategic results and leadership contribution. To achieve this outcome, Abbott grants non-qualified stock options, full-value performance-based shares,
and full-value restricted shares, subject to vesting requirements. 
Historically,
and in 2012, long-term incentives have comprised roughly two-thirds of total compensation for Abbott named officers. Accordingly, there is a compelling and direct
link of executives' long-term incentive with Company and shareholder results. 
 
 
  Benefits    
As
with all Abbott employees, executive officers are provided certain employment and post-employment benefits. Benefits are an important part of retention and capital preservation for all
levels of employees, protecting against the expense of unexpected catastrophic loss of health and/or earnings potential, as well as providing a means to save and accumulate for retirement or other
post-employment needs. 
 
 
  SAY-ON-PAY VOTE     

The Committee annually evaluates the Company's compensation policies and programs to ensure alignment with short- and long-term interests of our shareholders, evolving market practices and
other relevant factors. The Committee considers the following: whether the performance criteria and corresponding objectives appropriately balance objective performance and the quality of that
performance, the relationship between performance and incentive plan payouts, the mix of short- and long-term incentives, and whether the overall structure and application of the incentive
plans encourages appropriate risk taking. 
The
Committee also considers the perspectives of shareholders, through the Say on Pay advisory vote, which was approved by 92% of shareholders in 2012 and was above the average of the Company's health
care peer group. All of these factors are important in determining whether the Company's compensation programs are appropriately balanced between defining and incentivizing performance, encouraging
appropriate risk taking, and retaining executive talent which strongly aligns our compensation policies and programs with our shareholders' best interests. 
 
 
  PROGRAM CHANGES IN 2012     

In 2012, after careful consideration of shareholder input and evaluation of market and governance best practices, Abbott made three significant changes to its compensation plans. 

1.Abbott
replaced its change in control agreements during 2012. The new agreements eliminated three features: (i) the automatic renewal feature; (ii) the right to receive a
tax "gross-up" payment from Abbott if the executive is subject to the "golden parachute" excise tax; and (iii) the "modified single-trigger" severance provision, which was replaced
with a "double trigger" severance provision. Previously, executives could receive change in control severance benefits upon a resignation for any reason during a 30-day period commencing
after the six-month anniversary of the change in control. The new agreements provide that if the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive in a
"good reason" termination during the two-year period following the change in control, the executive will be eligible to receive change in control severance benefits. These new agreements
provide that if an executive's change in control severance payments would subject the executive to 

15

 

the
golden parachute excise tax, then (1) the executive will bear the cost of such excise tax or (2) if it would leave the executive in a better after-tax position, the
executive's change in control severance payments will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax. The new agreements' terms were developed with the assistance of the Committee's independent
compensation consultant. 


Mr. White
does not have a change in control agreement. 


2.The
vesting terms of officers' equity awards in the event of a change in control have been modified. Beginning with the 2013 grants, accelerated vesting of equity awards will be
limited to the circumstance where, within six months prior to and through two years after a change in control, an officer's employment is terminated without cause, or the officer resigns for good
reason, each as defined by the plan agreement. Previously, grants to officers would fully vest upon a change in control.
3.Beginning
in 2013, officers will not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. These trusts and their treatment in 2012 are discussed below in the sections captioned
"Retirement Benefits" and "Deferred Compensation". 
 
 
  HOW EXECUTIVE PAY DECISIONS ARE MADE     

The vast majority of pay decisions at Abbott are performance-based. Specific goals and targets are the foundation of our pay-for-performance process and this section will
describe how they apply to each pay component. It is important to remember, however, that while our pay process is based on a comprehensive, multi-level review at all levels, it is not formulaic. Some
goals can be measured objectively against pre-determined financial results. Others take the form of the Committee's subjective assessment of success and progress against strategic
objectives or leadership results, which cannot be scored by numeric or formulaic application of measurable criteria. Consequently, while final pay decisions are guided by specific, objective measures,
the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant also considers, at both the Company and individual level, a combination of objective and subjective measures in the overall
assessment of performance and the pay decisions that result from that assessment. Discussion of the decision-making criteria for each component follows. 
 
 
  Peer Group    
To
provide the appropriate context for executive pay decisions, the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, assesses market pay practices and levels of two peer groups
of relevant high-profile companies. The Committee thoughtfully considers on an annual basis which companies should be included in the peer groups and selects companies that are the most
appropriate for comparison. In addition to similar talent requirements and employee mix, the peer companies also operate complex business operations with significant global reach and share many
similar operational characteristics. Accordingly, for 2012, Abbott's comparison groups for setting targets for compensation included the following two global reference groups: 

1.Primarily,
direct health care competitors, including Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Glaxo SmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson,
Merck & Company, Inc., Novartis A.G., and Pfizer, Inc.
2.Secondarily,
the Committee also considers a group of global, diversified high performing companies with a five-year average return on equity of 18 percent or higher
that are similar to Abbott in terms of size and/or scope of operations, including 3M Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Caterpillar, The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company,
General Dynamics Corporation, General Mills, Inc., H.J. Heinz Company, Kellogg Company, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, McDonald's Corporation, Merck & Company, Inc.,
PepsiCo, Inc. and The Procter & Gamble Company. 
 
 
  Base Pay    
Base
pay targets must be competitive with the market from which talent is obtained. Generally, base pay targets are set in a manner that references the median of the health care comparison group as an
initial benchmark, but may be adjusted upon secondary reference to the high-performing group. Specific pay rates, however, are based on an executive's profile, performance, experience,
unique skills, and internal equity with others at Abbott. Once the rate of pay is set in this manner at either hire or upon promotion or transfer, subsequent changes in pay, including salary
increases, when appropriate, are based on the executive's performance, the job he or she is performing or assuming, internal equity, and the Company's operating budget. In this sense, base pay is
performance-based as well and is aligned with the individual's relative contribution / performance and body of work. 
 
 
  Annual Bonus    
During
2012, all of Abbott's five named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (the "PIP"). The PIP is designed to comply with the requirements of
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. 
Each
year, maximum award allocations for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings are set. For 2012, the maximum award for the Chief Executive Officer was .0015 of adjusted
consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year-end, and, for all of the other named officers, .00075 of adjusted consolidated net earnings. Historically, and in 2012, the Committee
exercised its discretion to deliver PIP awards that were below the maximum awards that are authorized by these formulae. 
Assessments
of performance against financial results take into account the impact of specified factors or events, and the appropriateness of these adjustments is reviewed annually. For a
reconciliation of these adjustments to GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to Abbott's Form 8-K, furnished on January 23, 2013. 

16

 

In
making its determination regarding the actual award to all participants, the Committee considers pre-determined financial goals and individual goals, some of which are objective and
quantifiable, and other strategic or leadership goals for which their subjective assessment is not solely dictated by numeric or formulaic applications of measurable criteria. Moreover, while each
participant has pre-determined goals, the Committee also considers relative achievements, or developments (in the Company, marketplace, and the global economy) that could not have been
foreseen when individual goals were written. 
Goals
that were specific for each named officer will be described separately. 
 
 
  Long-Term Incentives    
Long-term
incentive targets are driven by two primary factors: first, internal equity and the executive's relative contribution to the Company's long-term success; secondly,
the Company's performance against both short- and long-term returns to shareholders, as well as relative performance against financial or operating measures that drive shareholder returns,
and performance against strategic objectives, such as pipeline development or acquisitions (which may actually dilute returns in the short-term, but are, in the Committee's judgment, in
the best long-term interest of the Company and its shareholders). While long-term incentive awards may be awarded annually, the Committee's assessment includes
one-, three-, and five-year measures of a number of relative benchmarks, including total shareholder return, return on equity, return on net assets, and earnings per share
growth. The results are compared to both our direct health care competitors and the high performance reference group mentioned earlier. 
These
long-term measures are all taken into consideration without specific weighting. In aggregate, they provide the Committee with a relative performance rating of Abbott to peers on a
one-, three- and five-year period. Then, starting with the independent compensation consultant's recommendations regarding target or reference levels of appropriate
long-term incentive by individual, the Committee determines grants for each individual based on their objective and subjective assessment of performance, progress against strategic
milestones, and environmental factors, which affected the individual's or Company's performance. 
It
is important to note that while the Committee may target pay levels for a group of executives or a specific executive at, higher than, or below a certain performance percentile which the
independent compensation consultant may forecast, the actual awards are made without knowledge of the actual long-term incentive awards made by competitors for the current performance
period, since some elements of competitors' actual performance and their actual compensation awards for the current performance period are unknown at the time of award. The independent compensation
consultant's long-term incentive information always reflects prior performance periods, so it is impossible at the time of the award to precisely predict where actual pay decisions will
leave Abbott's executive officers in comparison to others. 
 
 
  Long-Term Incentives  Equity Awards    
Based
on the Committee's assessment of performance, the goals of the Company's long-term incentive program, each individual's relative performance against his or her
pre-determined goals, current outstanding awards held by the officers and the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant, the Committee delivered long-term
incentive awards that were intended to, in aggregate, reflect performance at the median of the health care peer comparison group. 
Applying
these standards, the Committee determined the value for each named officer and made the awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement. Further, the Committee
determined, in 2012, based on market practice, advice from its independent compensation consultant and in consideration of the recommendations of institutional shareholders, the long-term
incentive award for named officers should be in the form of 25 percent stock options and 75 percent performance-vested shares. 
Abbott's
policy with respect to its annual equity award for all employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers and all other officers of the Company, is to grant this award and
set the grant price at the same time each year, at the Compensation Committee's regularly scheduled February meeting. These meeting dates are generally the third Friday of February and are scheduled
two years in advance. In 2012, the annual grant was dated and the grant price set on February 17th. The historical practice for setting the grant price is the average of the
highest and lowest trading price of a common share on the date of the grant (rounded up to the next even penny). The grant price for the 2012 annual grant was set at $56.26. The high, low and closing
price of an Abbott common share on February 17th was $56.48, $56.04 and $56.36, respectively. 
In
establishing criteria for performance vesting shares, the Committee considered the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant, and the fact that the secondary comparison of
"High-Performance Companies" is currently defined by five-year average return on equity of 18 percent or greater. 
Accordingly,
the Committee established that performance-based stock awards granted in 2012 be earned (vested) over a period of up to five years, with not more than one-third of the award
vesting in any one year, dependent upon the Company achieving an annual return on equity threshold of 18 percent from continuing operations adjusted for specified items per the quarterly
earnings releases (which is currently above the median of Abbott's Standard Industrial Classification peer group). 
The
Incentive Stock Program requires that performance goals be equitably adjusted to reflect the separation of Abbott and AbbVie. For awards granted in 2011 and 2012 that are scheduled to vest in the
future, the performance requirement will be dependent upon the Company achieving an annual return on equity threshold of 10 percent from continuing operations adjusted for specified items per
the quarterly earnings releases. 

17

 

If
the thresholds are met in three of the five years, 100 percent of the performance shares will vest. If the thresholds are missed in all five years, 100 percent of the
performance-based shares will be forfeited. Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the same rate as all other shareholders. 
 
 
  PERFORMANCE GOALS     

Abbott's payment of annual bonuses to each of its named officers is subject to the achievement of financial and other performance goals, which are described below with respect to the 2012 fiscal year. 
 
 
  Financial Goals    
Each
officer carried a financial goal of Adjusted Diluted EPS that comprised 20% of his or her total goals. In addition to EPS, most officers had other financial goals specific to each officer's area
of responsibility. The process of determining annual bonus awards allows for the Committee's discretion, since many goals cannot be reduced to formulaic, numerical targets, or anticipated in advance.
The following comprised the financial goals, considered in the aggregate, in determining each named officer's bonus.

  GOAL PERFORMANCE AND 2012 COMPENSATION DECISIONS     

The individual goals described above are determined at the beginning of the year as part of the Company's annual performance and compensation planning process. The Committee considers, both at the
Company and individual level, achievement with respect to these goals, as well as the performance of the individual overall with respect to all matters not specifically defined in the
pre-determined goals, including leadership competencies and other individual contributions to Company performance on a qualitative basis. Additionally, the Committee may also consider
unforeseen circumstances or developments (in the Company, marketplace, and/or the global economy) that may have affected performance. 
For
each participant, a target bonus is set as follows: 
Base
Salary * Target Bonus Percentage = Target Bonus Amount 
To
determine each individual's annual bonus, the Committee considered the executive's target bonus, expressed as a percentage of base pay, and made its final determination of the appropriate award at,
above or below the target, considering all of these factors, and in consultation with its independent compensation consultant. While the review is comprehensive, it is not solely formulaic. 
In
each case, for all of the named officers, and furthermore, all other executive officers not subject to this disclosure, there were multiple levels of review of the proposed award. For the CEO, the
Compensation Committee and the independent compensation consultant reviewed the proposed compensation. For the other named officers and other executive officers not subject to this disclosure, the
CEO, Compensation Committee and the Committee's independent compensation consultant reviewed the proposals. 
Actual
bonuses were above the target based on a comprehensive review of individual and corporate performance by the Committee, and its independent compensation consultant.

transfer of certain key senior executives to AbbVie, Mr. Alban's base salary was set at $710,000. He also received a 18,453 share performance-vesting restricted stock award, which converted
100 percent to AbbVie performance-vesting restricted stock at separation. The award will cliff vest after January 1, 2016 subject to continued employment with AbbVie and the satisfaction
of AbbVie performance criteria. 
 
 
  Post Termination and Other Benefits     

Each of the benefits described below was chosen to support the Company's objective of providing a total competitive pay program. Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other
benefits or pay components, except to the extent that all benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. Mr. Gonzalez, who had retired from Abbott in
2007, returned to work at Abbott in 2009. Upon his return to Abbott, Mr. Gonzalez did not become an active participant in any of Abbott's employee benefits plans. Instead, he continued to
receive previously earned Abbott retiree benefits, including pension and retiree healthcare benefits through December 31, 2012. AbbVie will assume responsibility for providing post termination
and other benefits for the named officers who transferred to AbbVie as part of the business separation. 
 
 
  Retirement Benefits     

The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are
described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned "Pension Benefits." 
Since
officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust, officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in
present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited
amounts may be credited with the difference between the officer's actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8 percent). Amounts deposited in the
individual trusts are not tax deferred. In 2012, since amounts contributed to the trust had already been taxed, Abbott remitted the tax owed on the income earned by the trust or any Company funded
adjustment paid to the trust, thus preserving the parity of the benefit to those payable under the Annuity Retirement Plan. As noted previously, beginning in 2013, officers will not receive tax
gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon retirement from the Company generally follows the manner elected by the
officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse depending upon the pension distribution method elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan) live
beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit, and therefore exhaust the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid to the
officer by Abbott. 
 
 
  Deferred Compensation     

Officers of the Company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary, on a pre-tax basis, to the Company's qualified 401(k) plan, up to the IRS
contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18 percent of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan. All U.S. employees
may defer up to 18 percent as well, subject to IRS limits. One hundred percent (100 percent) of annual incentive awards earned under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan are also
eligible for deferral to a non-qualified plan. Officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into 

20

 


individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. As noted previously, beginning in 2013 officers will not receive tax
gross-ups on their grantor trusts. In 2012, since amounts contributed to the trusts had already been taxed, Abbott remitted the tax owed on the income earned by the trusts or any Company
funded adjustment paid to the trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the Company. 
 
 
  Change in Control Arrangements     

As described previously, Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement. The other named officers have change in control agreements, the purpose of which is to aid in retention and
recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the Company, and to protect the earned benefits of the officer
against adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to
the Committee by its independent compensation consultant. These arrangements are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in
Control." 
 
 
  Financial Planning     

Named officers are eligible for up to $10,000 of annual costs associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation and general financial planning fees. If an officer chooses to utilize this
benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation are paid by the Company and are treated as imputed income to the officer, who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due on the
fees paid by the Company. 
 
 
  Company Automobile     

Named officers are eligible for use of a Company-leased vehicle, with a lease term of 50 months. Seventy-five percent (75 percent) of the cost of the vehicle is imputed to
the officer as income for federal income tax purposes. 
 
 
  Company Aircraft     

Non-business related flights on corporate aircraft by Messrs. White and Freyman are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant to which certain costs associated
with those flights are reimbursed by the executives to the Company in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. 
 
 
  Disability Benefit     

In addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, the named officers are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is described in greater detail in the section of the
proxy captioned, "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
 
 
  SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES     

To further promote sustained shareholder return and to ensure the Company's executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives, the Company has established share ownership
guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the position. The share ownership requirements are 175,000
shares for the Chief Executive Officer; 50,000 shares for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents and 25,000 shares for all other officers. All named officers meet or substantially exceed
the guidelines. 
As
provided in Abbott's Incentive Stock Program, no award may be assigned, alienated, sold or transferred otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order or as permitted by the Committee for estate planning purposes, and no award and no right under any award, may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered. All
members of senior management, including the Company's executive officers and certain other employees, are required to clear any transaction involving Company stock with the General Counsel prior to
entering into such transaction. 
 
 
  COMPLIANCE     

The Performance Incentive Plan and Incentive Stock Program, which are described above, are intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) to ensure deductibility. 
The
Committee reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not
restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, the
Committee may from time to time approve components of compensation for certain officers that are not deductible. 
While
the Committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award decisions were based would occur, the Committee, in
evaluating such circumstances, has discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of shareholders up to and including actions to recover such incentive awards. Such circumstances
have never occurred.

  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT     

The Compensation Committee of the Board is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing Abbott's compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the Committee's
independent consultant to establish Abbott's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and has
recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

  Compensation Risk Assessment     

During 2012, Abbott, through its Human Resources department in coordination with Internal Audit, conducted a risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for employees, including those
related to its executive compensation programs. Abbott's risk assessment included a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its employee compensation and benefit programs, including those for its
executive officers. Abbott also considered how these programs compare, from a design perspective, to programs maintained by other companies. Based on this assessment, Abbott determined its
compensation and benefit programs appropriately incentivize employees and any risks arising from its compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Abbott. The following factors were among those considered in making this determination: 


Abbott's
long-established compensation structure has contributed to a corporate culture that encourages employees to regard Abbott as a career employer. For
example, Abbott's U.S. employees participate in an Abbott sponsored defined benefit pension plan. Equity awards (discussed in more detail below) also vest over multi-year periods. Both
forms of compensation encourage Abbott employees to consider the long-term impact of their decisions and align their interests with those of Abbott's shareholders.
Abbott's
long-term incentive program focuses executives on longer-term operating performance and shareholder returns. In 2012, Abbott's named
officers received roughly two-thirds of their total compensation in the form of long-term equity incentives (25% of which are stock options, vesting over multi-year
periods and 75% of which are performance awards, which vest over a period of up to five years with not more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year). Abbott's officers do not
receive any of their long-term incentive compensation in cash.
Abbott's
annual incentive program places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other factors. Since earnings are a key component of stock
price performance, this aspect of Abbott's compensation plan also promotes alignment with shareholder interests.
Abbott
makes equity awards and sets grant prices at the same time each year, at the compensation committee's regularly scheduled meeting. In addition, Abbott does not award
discounted stock options or immediately vesting stock options or restricted stock.
Abbott
has share ownership guidelines for its officers, which promotes alignment with shareholder interests.
Abbott's
compensation committee has the ability to exercise downward discretion in determining annual incentive plan payouts. Historically, and in 2012, the compensation
committee exercised its discretion to deliver annual incentive plan awards below the maximums.
Abbott
requires mandatory training on its codes of conduct and policies and procedures to educate its employees on appropriate behaviors and the consequences of taking
inappropriate actions.
Abbott
does not include certain design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, including: over-weighting toward
annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable thresholds, and steep payout cliffs at certain levels that may encourage short-term business decisions to meet payout
thresholds. 

This
assessment was discussed with the compensation committee and its independent compensation consultant.

(1)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines grant date fair value by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott
common share on the award's date of grant.
(2)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts include the grant date fair values of $34,169 and $4,393 attributable to replacement stock options issued in 2012 to L. J. Schumacher and
C. Alban, respectively, with respect to original option grants made before 2005. Except for outstanding options that have a replacement option feature, options granted after 2004 do not include a
replacement option feature. When the exercise price of an option with a replacement option feature is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise
price or the withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with Abbott common shares held by the named officer, a replacement option may be granted for the number of shares used to
make that payment. Abbott uses the closing price of an Abbott common share on the business day before the exercise to determine the number of shares required to exercise the related option and the
exercise price of the replacement option. The replacement option is exercisable in full six months after the date of grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option. Other
terms and conditions of the replacement option award are the same in all material respects to those applicable to the original grant.
(3)These
amounts were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative
disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined using a Black-Scholes stock option 

25

 

valuation
model would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. For options, other than the replacement options, the assumptions are the same as those described in
Note 8 entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Abbott's 2012
Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. For replacement options, the model used the following assumptions: expected volatility of 14%; dividend yield ranging
between 2.4% and 2.6%; risk-free interest of 0.2%; and an option life equal to 60% of the option's remaining life. 


(4)This
compensation is earned as a performance-based incentive bonus, pursuant to the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan. Additional information regarding the
Performance Incentive Plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis  How Executive Pay Decisions Are
Made  Annual Bonus."
(5)Except
as provided below, the plan amounts shown below are reported in this column. 

For
Messrs. White, Freyman, and Gonzalez and for Ms. Schumacher, the amounts shown alongside the officer's name are for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For Mr. Alban, the
amount shown is for 2012. 
Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan 
M. D.
White: $177,433 / $153,557 / $150,820; T. C. Freyman: $210,536 / $210,878 / $125,416; R. A. Gonzalez: ($426,732) / $33,248 / $3,001; L. J. Schumacher: $129,541 /
$85,875 / $37,903; and C. Alban: $204,199. 
Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan 
M. D.
White: $5,444,865 / $4,855,579 / $5,164,591; T. C. Freyman: $1,771,959 / $1,963,122 / $1,375,435; R. A. Gonzalez: ($4,420,361) / $743,082 / $245,389; L. J.
Schumacher: $1,464,372 / $939,737 / $541,637; and C. Alban: $1,521,110. 
As
required by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the 2012 plan amounts shown above for R. A. Gonzalez are excluded from the total reported in this column. 
Non-Qualified
Defined Contribution Plan Earnings 
The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, the Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan, and the 1986 Abbott
Laboratories Management Incentive Plan (although none of the named officers currently receives awards under this plan). 
M. D. White:
$540,649 / $409,944 / $224,973; T. C. Freyman: $66,693 / $37,250 / $16,403; R. A. Gonzalez: $64,503 / $106,658 / $63,866;
L. J. Schumacher: $177,393 / $112,511 / $49,329; and C. Alban: $75,700. 


(6)The
present value of a pension benefit is determined, in part, by the discount rate used for accounting purposes. As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, that
discount rate is determined by reference to the prevailing market rate of interest. In 2012, interest rates declined and the discount rate used for the Annuity Retirement Plan and Supplemental Pension
Plan was reduced to reflect that decline. A reduction in the discount rate increases the present value of participants' pensions while actual payments to be made to participants are not changed. The
discount rate used for 2012 was 4.49%. The discount rate used for 2011 was 5.18%. 

The
change in pension value included in this total is the result of the following factors: (i) the impact of changes in the actuarial assumptions Abbott uses to calculate plan liability for
financial reporting purposes, primarily the change in discount rate, (ii) additional pension benefit accrual under the Annuity Retirement Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan, (iii) the
impact of the time value of money on the pension value, and (iv) with respect to Mr. Gonzalez, payments made from these plans.

For
Messrs. White, Freyman, and Gonzalez and Ms. Schumacher, the amounts shown alongside the officer's name are for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For Mr. Alban, the amount
shown is for 2012. 
Earnings,
Fees and Tax Payments for Non-Qualified Defined Benefit and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plans (net of the reportable interest
included in footnote 5). 
M. D. White:
$392,759 / $416,263 / $352,026; T. C. Freyman: $45,320 / $46,438 / $43,730; R. A. Gonzalez: $154,681 / $72,623 / $76,225;
L. J. Schumacher: $97,801 / $88,141 / $65,627; and C. Alban: $42,667. 
Each
of the named officers' awards under the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan is paid in cash to the officer on a current basis and may be deposited into a grantor trust established
by the officer, net of maximum tax withholdings. Each of the named officers has also established grantor trusts in connection with the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, the Abbott
Laboratories 401(k) 


26

 



Supplemental Plan, and the 1986 Abbott Laboratories Management Incentive Plan (although none of the named officers currently receives awards under this plan). These amounts include the earnings (net
of the reportable interest included in footnote 5), fees, and tax payments paid in connection with these grantor trusts. 
Employer
Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans 
M. D. White:
$95,000 / $95,000 / $94,669; T. C. Freyman: $47,335 / $47,335 / $47,096; R. A. Gonzalez: $0 / $0 / $0; L. J. Schumacher: $41,584 /

These
amounts include employer contributions to both Abbott's tax-qualified defined contribution plan and the Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan. The Abbott Laboratories 401(k)
Supplemental Plan permits Abbott's officers to contribute amounts in excess of the limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions to 401(k) plans up to the excess of (i) 18%
of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to Abbott's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Abbott matches participant contributions at the rate of 250% of the first 2% of
compensation contributed to the Plan. The named officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by the officer, net of maximum tax
withholdings. 
Other
Compensation 
Messrs. White's
and Freyman's non-business related flights on corporate aircraft are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant to which they reimburse Abbott
for certain costs associated with those flights in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. The following amounts are included in the totals in this column, which reflect Abbott's
incremental cost less reimbursements for non-business related flights, M. D. White: $213,435 / $206,464 / $176,560; T. C. Freyman: $13,686 / $5,182 / $4,704;
and R. A. Gonzalez: $294,607 / $372,823 / $185,808. 
Abbott
determines the incremental cost for flights based on the direct cost to Abbott, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees, catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous direct
costs. 
For
Mr. White, the following costs associated with security are included: $168,519 / $178,556 / $184,473. Abbott determines the cost for these expenses based on its actual costs. The security
is provided on the recommendation of an independent security study. 
Also
included in the totals shown in the table is the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the officer: T. C. Freyman: $17,280 / $17,497 / $17,862;

(1)During
2012, each of the named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, an annual, non-equity incentive plan. The annual cash
incentive award earned by the named officer in 2012 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table under the column captioned, "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No
future payouts will be made under the plan's 2012 annual cash incentive award. The Performance Incentive Plan is described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned,
"Compensation Discussion and Analysis  How Executive Pay Decisions Are Made  Annual Bonus."
(2)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a 5-year term and vest upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target, with no more than
one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2012, Abbott reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards made on February 17,
2012, vested on February 28, 2013. The equity targets are described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis  How Executive Pay
Decisions Are Made  Long-Term Incentives  Equity Awards."
(3)In
the event of a grantee's death or disability or a change in control of Abbott, as defined in Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock programs, these awards are deemed fully earned.
Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the same rate as all other shareholders.
(4)L. J.
Schumacher and C. Alban are officers of AbbVie. At the time of separation, these awards were converted into equivalent AbbVie awards. They will vest after
January 1, 2016, subject to continued employment with AbbVie from the grant date through the vesting date and AbbVie reaching a minimum return on equity target for the period of 2013 through
2015.
(5)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years. The options vest in the
event of the grantee's death or disability or a change in control of Abbott. Under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the average of
the high and low market prices (rounded-up to the next even penny) of an Abbott common share on the date of grant. These options do not contain a replacement option feature.
(6)These
are replacement options. When the exercise price of an option with a replacement feature is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's
exercise price or the withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with Abbott common shares held by the named officer, a replacement option may be granted for the number of shares
used to make that payment. Abbott uses the closing price of an Abbott common share on the business day before the exercise to determine the number of shares required to exercise the related option and
the exercise price of the replacement option. The replacement option is exercisable in full six months after the date of grant, and has a term 

28

 

expiring
on the expiration date of the original option. Other terms and conditions of the replacement option award are the same in all material respects to those applicable to the original grant. 


(7)Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of restricted shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott common
share on the grant date.
(8)These
values were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The model uses the assumptions described in Note 8, entitled,
"Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" in Abbott's 2012 Annual Report on Securities
and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. The assumptions for replacement options are described in footnote 3 to the Summary Compensation table on pages 25 and 26.

  Pension Benefits     

During 2012, the named officers participated in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the
Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature Abbott uses to attract officers who
are at the mid-point of their career. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have spent most of
their career at Abbott. AbbVie has assumed responsibility for providing these benefits to Messrs. Gonzalez and Alban and Ms. Schumacher, who transferred to AbbVie as part of the business
separation. Except as provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change in control agreements are
described on pages 41 and 42. 
The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 25. 
 
 
  Annuity Retirement Plan     

The Annuity Retirement Plan covers most employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or
C below. 

A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied
by years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 

0.50%
of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of
benefit service. 


C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 
The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and
employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The
Annuity Retirement Plan covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003 who terminate
prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to
age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50
with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
The
Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Employees
who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with
10 years of service. Employees hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit service
total 70 or more. Messrs. White, Freyman, and Alban are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching
age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit
is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement: 

In
general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62
and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62.
Employees
who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age plus Seniority Service points
of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94 before age 65. Seniority
Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early 

37

 

Special
Retirement applies, Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced
12/3 percent for each year between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings
portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced
3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 
 
  Supplemental Pension Plan     

With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement Plan: 

Officers'
5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of payments under
Abbott's non-equity incentive plans.
The
Annuity Retirement Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of a
participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a participant under the
Deferred Compensation Plan in its
calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election as an officer, Abbott officers are no longer eligible to defer compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
In
addition to the benefits outlined above for the Annuity Retirement Plan, officers are eligible for a benefit equal to 0.6% of 5-year final average earnings
for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum percentage allowed under the
Annuity Retirement Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B and C above). The portion of this additional officer benefit attributable to service prior to 2004 is reduced 3 percent per year
for each year that payments are made before age 60. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 60 if the
participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65.
The
Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The benefits provided to officers under the
Supplemental Pension Plan are not, however, reduced for the period between age 60 and age 62, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. Messrs. White, Freyman, and Alban are
eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan.
Vested
plan benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the officer. Consistent with the distribution
requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those officers who were elected prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan benefits funded through a
grantor trust. Officers elected after 2008 may only have the vested plan benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which the officer is first elected funded through a grantor trust. Vested
plan benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the participants' income. 
Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental
Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

(1)Abbott
calculates these present values using: (i) a 4.49% discount rate, the same discount rate it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715
calculations for financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's unreduced retirement age, which is age 62 under the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and age 60 under the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for those officers who are eligible for early retirement benefits and is age 65 under both plans for other officers. The present values shown in the table
reflect postretirement mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2000 Combined Healthy table), but do not include a factor for preretirement
termination, mortality, or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan benefits, to the extent not previously
funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the officer's individual trust are expected to offset Abbott's
obligations to the officer under the plan. During 2012, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established by the named officers. Grantor trusts
are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis  Goal Performance and 2012 Compensation
Decisions  Retirement Benefits".
(3)Mr. Gonzalez
retired from Abbott in 2007 and began receiving payments from the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and distributions from his Abbott Laboratories
Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust. When he returned to work at Abbott in 2009, these payments and distributions continued. 

A
portion of Mr. Gonzalez's accumulated benefit under the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan was assigned to his ex-spouse in accordance with a qualified domestic relations
order. The assigned amount is included in the "Payments During Last Fiscal Year" column above and Mr. Gonzalez no longer has any interest in that amount. A portion of Mr. Gonzalez's
accumulated benefit under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan also was assigned to his ex-spouse in accordance with a domestic relations order, resulting in the transfer of
grantor trust assets of $5,196,751 to his ex-spouse. Mr. Gonzalez no longer has any interest in that amount. His ex-spouse will not accrue any additional pension
benefits under any AbbVie or Abbott plan.

(1)Ms. Schumacher's
contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan ceased after she became an Abbott officer.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 75 percent of their base salary and up to 100 percent of their annual cash incentives and credits a participant's account
with an amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under Abbott's tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Participants may
direct the investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral and the deferral account is credited with investment returns based on
the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2012, the weighted average rate of return credited to Ms. Schumacher's account was 16.4 percent. 

The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make
distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants
may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the hardship. 


(3)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(4)The
amounts reported in this column have not been previously reported as compensation in Abbott's Summary Compensation Tables because they relate to contributions made before
Ms. Schumacher became a named officer.

  Potential Payments Upon  Termination or Change in Control   
 
 
  Potential Payments Upon Termination  Generally     

Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. 
The
following summarizes the payments that the named officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2012. Earnings, fees, and tax payments would have continued
to be paid for the named officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully distributed and fees would have
continued to be paid for the named officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust, until its assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the period over which the
trusts' assets were distributed, tax rates, and the trusts' earnings and fees. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current tax rates, earnings, and
fees, the named officers would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period: M. D. White, $730,995; T. C. Freyman, $117,820;
L. J. Schumacher, $273,114; and C. Alban, $125,588. Pursuant to an election made at the time of his retirement in 2007, R. A. Gonzalez trust assets began to be
distributed over a 35-year period when he retired. Based on current tax rates, earnings and fees, and assuming the distributions continue during the remaining 30 years of the
distribution period, he will receive an average annual payment of $127,698 over the distribution period. In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for each of the following named officers, respectively, M. D. White, $1,852,553; T. C. Freyman, $285,157;
L. J. Schumacher, $565,860; and C. Alban, $2,014,030. As Messrs. White, Freyman, and Alban are eligible to retire, each of them would be eligible to begin to receive the
pension benefits described on pages 37 to 38. If the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers also would have received, in addition to Abbott's
standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability benefit in the amount of $195,833 for M. D. White; $52,917 for T. C. Freyman; $52,917 for
L. J. Schumacher; and $28,125 for C. Alban. This long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 18 months following termination of employment. It ends if
the officer retires, recovers, dies or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In
addition, if the named officer's employment had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31, 2012 with
values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards." 
 
 
  Potential Payments Upon Change in Control     

Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement with Abbott. 
Abbott
has change in control arrangements with key members of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for certain other
management personnel. The agreements with Messrs. Freyman, Gonzalez and Alban and Ms. Schumacher are described below. 
Each
change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2014, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of
non-renewal is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given,
the agreement will expire on the one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below)
that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years
following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this
purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and
the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid
bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for
good reason during a potential change in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of
the bonus to which the officer is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the
potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer
in the preceding three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including
welfare benefits; outplacement services and tax and financial 

41

 


counseling; and the value of three more years of pension accruals). If change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code, payments under the agreement will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the executive in a better after-tax position
than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options
to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. Independent compensation consultants have confirmed that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market
practice. 
For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the
outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the board of directors whose appointment was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under
the agreements includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the
executive's position, duties, or authority; the company's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of the company's
principal executive offices to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2012, immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Mr. Freyman, Mr. Gonzalez,
Ms. Schumacher, and Mr. Alban would have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements: 

Mr. Freyman:
Cash termination payments  $7,234,300; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits  $943,354; Welfare and
fringe benefits  $93,390.
Mr. Gonzalez:
Cash termination payments  $9,598,900; Welfare and fringe benefits  $68,198.
Ms. Schumacher:
Cash termination payments  $5,548,318; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits  $977,177; Welfare and
fringe benefits  $68,741.
Mr. Alban:
Cash termination payments  $4,635,000; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits  $3,586,270; Welfare and
fringe benefits  $84,570. 
The
separation of AbbVie from Abbott was not a change in control under the agreements, and no payments or benefits were triggered in connection with the separation. 
Effective
January 1, 2013, AbbVie assumed the change in control agreements for Messrs. Gonzalez and Alban and Ms. Schumacher, as well as for certain other AbbVie officers. 
 
 
  Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards     

Under the Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units granted prior to February 2013 vest upon a change in control,
including performance-based restricted shares, which are deemed earned in full. These Programs, which were approved by Abbott's shareholders, cover approximately 14,000 participants, including a broad
group of management and professional staff. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2012: 

Mr. White
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 597,299 unvested stock options with a value of $7,589,970, and (2) in an aggregate of 373,933
restricted shares with a value equal to $24,492,612.
Mr. Freyman
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 193,866 unvested stock options with a value of $2,398,189, and (2) in an aggregate of 152,066
restricted shares with a value equal to $9,960,323.
Mr. Gonzalez
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 144,033 unvested stock options with a value of $1,685,706, and (2) in an aggregate of 98,866
restricted shares with a value equal to $6,475,723.
Ms. Schumacher
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 141,477 unvested stock options with a value of $1,674,509, and (2) in an aggregate 147,421
restricted shares with a value equal to $9,656,076.
Mr. Alban
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 92,648 unvested stock options with a value of $1,149,473, and (2) in an aggregate of 95,686
restricted shares with a value equal to $6,267,433. 
The
value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of an Abbott common share on December 31, 2012 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of
unvested stock options held by the named officer. The value of restricted shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted shares that would vest as of December 31, 2012 and
the closing price of an Abbott common share on December 31, 2012.

  Approval Process for Related Person Transactions     

It is Abbott's policy that the nominations and governance committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott participates and in which any related person has a direct or indirect
material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related person transactions requiring review by the nominations
and governance committee pursuant to this policy are identified in: 

questionnaires
annually distributed to Abbott's directors and officers;
certifications
submitted annually by Abbott officers related to their compliance with Abbott's Code of Business Conduct; or
communications
made directly by the related person to the chief financial officer or general counsel. 
In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the nominations and governance committee will consider the following items, among others: 

the
related person's relationship to Abbott and interest in the transaction;
the
material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal involved;
the
benefits to Abbott of the transaction;
if
applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;
an
assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally;
whether
a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and
whether
the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 
This
process is included in the nominations and governance committee's written charter, which is available on the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations Web site
(www.abbottinvestor.com). Abbott did not have any related person transactions in 2012 requiring nominations and governance committee approval under this policy.

   Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Auditors (Item 2 on Proxy Card)     

Abbott's By-Laws provide that the audit committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as auditors. In December 2012, to provide continuity
and permit an orderly transition, the audit committee appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as auditors for 2013. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as Abbott's auditors
since 2002. As discussed in the section captioned, "Change of Independent Public Accountants," the Audit Committee has approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Abbott's
independent registered public accounting firm beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014. 
Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors
for 2013. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for 2013, the
audit committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for
2013.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to
do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
 
 
  Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees     

The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Limited, and their respective affiliates (the
"Deloitte Entities") for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, and fees billed for other services rendered by the
Deloitte Entities during these periods.

related fees include: accounting consultations and audits in connection with proposed acquisitions and divestitures; audits of certain employee benefit plans' financial
statements; and, in 2012, audits and audit related services in connection with the separation of AbbVie from Abbott, including associated filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(3)Tax
fees consist principally of professional services rendered by the Deloitte Entities for tax compliance and tax planning and advice including assistance with tax audits and
appeals, and tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions.
(4)All
other fees primarily represent consulting services for an information technology project engagement Abbott entered with a firm before that firm's acquisition by a Deloitte Entity
in 2011. 
 
 
  Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Auditor     

The audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the Deloitte Entities. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public
accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the
independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific
pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The
audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to
the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.

  Change of Independent Public Accountants     

As previously reported on Abbott's Current Report on Form 8-K, dated December 14, 2012, the Audit Committee approved the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche LLP
("Deloitte") as Abbott's independent registered public accountant, effective as of the date of Deloitte's completion of the audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2013 and the
filing of Abbott's 2013 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. 
The
reports of Deloitte on Abbott's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and
were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle, and included explanatory paragraphs. The 2012 report included an explanatory paragraph regarding the distribution
of the shares of AbbVie Inc. to the Company's shareholders and the Company's change to the year end of its foreign subsidiaries. The 2011 report included an explanatory
paragraph regarding Abbott's change to the year end of its foreign subsidiaries and change to its presentation of comprehensive income during 2011. 
During
Abbott's fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, and through February 15, 2013, (i) there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between Abbott and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte would have caused Deloitte to make reference to the subject matter of
the disagreement in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no "reportable events" (as that term is defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
On
December 14, 2012, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Abbott's independent registered public accounting firm to perform independent audit
services beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2014. During Abbott's fiscal years ending December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, and through February 15, 2013, neither
Abbott, nor anyone on its behalf, consulted Ernst & Young regarding either (i) application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered with respect to the consolidated financial statements of Abbott, in any case where a written report or oral advice was provided to Abbott by Ernst &
Young that Ernst & Young concluded was an important factor considered by Abbott in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter
that was the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a "reportable event" (as that term is
defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 

45


   





 
 
  Report of the Audit Committee     

Management is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the
consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this context, the Audit
Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public
accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standards Section AU 380  (Communication with Audit Committees), as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 44 under the caption "Audit Fees and
Non-Audit Fees" is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Say on Pay  An Advisory Vote on the Approval of Executive Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card)     

Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including the compensation discussion and analysis,
the compensation tables and related material included in this proxy statement. 
In
2012, 92% of shareholders approved Abbott's Say on Pay proposal. However, after careful consideration of shareholder input and evaluation of market and governance best practices, Abbott made three
significant changes to its compensation plans, as outlined on pages 15 and 16. 
On
January 1, 2013, Abbott separated its former research-based pharmaceuticals business to create AbbVie, a Fortune 200 biopharmaceutical company. Abbott is now a diversified healthcare company
comprised of four roughly equal-sized businesses: established pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics and nutritional products. Returns for Abbott in 2012 were 20.3 percent, nearly twice
the Dow Jones Industrial Average return of 10.2 percent and above the S&P 500 return of 16.0 percent. Additionally, Abbott achieved the company's 2012 financial and strategic
goals in all material aspects, and has consistently performed among the best of its health care peers in sales and earnings growth over each of the last five years. 
In
terms of long-term performance, the company significantly outperformed the broader market on five-year total shareholder return. Total returns for Abbott on this basis were
37.1 percent, more than 2.5 times greater than the Dow Jones Industrial Average return of 13.8 percent and over four times higher than the S&P 500 return of 8.6 percent.
Given the company's strong operational results and shareholder return, the Compensation Committee concluded the compensation reported herein was earned and appropriate. CEO direct compensation,
including salary, bonus, and long-term incentives, increased by 2.2 percent in total, which was less than
Abbott's budget of 3 percent for U.S. payroll merit increases. The specific details of Abbott's executive compensation program and compensation paid to the named officers are described on
pages 14 through 21 of this proxy statement. 
The
independent Compensation Committee of the Board, with the counsel of its independent consultant, has thoroughly examined Abbott's programs, the company's performance related to our industry and
high-performing peer group and market factors. The committee determined the specific pay decisions for the named officers are appropriate given the company's performance, the executives'
contributions, and our shareholders' interests. 
While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the board of directors and Compensation Committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results, and take into
account the results and our ongoing dialogue with shareholders when future compensation decisions are made. 
Accordingly, the board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers'
compensation.

47


   





 
 
  Shareholder Proposals     

Six shareholder proposals have been received. Abbott is advised that the proposals will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed resolutions and the statements made in support
thereof, as well as the board of directors' statements in opposition to these proposals, are presented on the following pages. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposals.

  Shareholder Proposal on Genetically Modified Ingredients (Item 4 on Proxy Card)     

David A. Rudd, c/o As You Sow, 1611 Telegraph Avenue, Suite 1450, Oakland, CA 94612, has informed Abbott that he intends to present the following proposal at the meeting and that he owns over
$2,000 worth of Abbott common shares. 
WHEREAS: Abbott Laboratories' uses genetically modified (GMO) ingredients in products of its nutritional lines of foods including in its nine Similac
Soy Isomil Products intended for infants; 
Our
competitor, Gerber Products announced it would not allow genetically engineered (GE) corn or soybeans in any of their baby foods (7/99); 
Investors
are starting to scrutinize "off-balance sheet" liabilities, such as risks associated with activities harmful to human health and the environment that can impact
long-term shareholder value; 
The
entire European Union, Australia, China, Japan, and Russia require GMO labeling, and several of the US states have passed or proposed similar labeling laws. According to a 2010 poll conducted by
Reuter Thompson, more than 90 percent of Americans thought GMO-containing foods should be labeled; 
An
analysis of current toxicity protocols, Debate on GMOs Health Risks after Statistical Findings in Regulatory Tests. (Int J Biol Sci 2010;
6:590-598) calls for longer, more detailed, and transparent toxicological tests on GMOs or GE-foods; 
The
recently published peer reviewed study, "Long Term Toxicity of Roundup-Tolerant Genetically Modified Maize" (Food and Chemical Toxicology Sept. 2012) found that lab rats fed GMO NK603 over two
year period had significantly shorter lifespans than controls due to increased tumor growth in the breasts, pituitary, and liver; 
Some
GE crops have been engineered with higher levels of toxins, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) a soil bacterium with insecticidal effects, to make them insect resistant that may involve the
synthesis of natural carcinogens posing a public health risk. A 2011 study, reported the presence of pesticides associated with GM foods in both non-pregnant women and pregnant women and
their fetuses; 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board of Directors to adopt a policy of removing genetically engineered crops, organisms, or products thereof from
all nutritional products sold or manufactured by the company, whenever feasible, until long-term safety testing has shown that they are not harmful to humans, animals, and the environment;
with the interim step of labeling and identifying these products that may contain these ingredients, and reporting to the shareholders, at reasonable cost and excluding proprietary information, on
such policy and its implementation by October 2013. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

We believe that this technology involves significant social, economic, and environmental risks. Our company should take a leadership position regarding sale of genetically engineered crops and foods.
Failure to do so could leave our company financially liable and at risk of damage to its brand and reputation, should detrimental effects to public health or the environment appear in the future. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Genetically Modified Ingredients (Item 4 on Proxy  Card)     

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Abbott
is committed to the safety of its nutritional products and providing solutions to improve the quality of life of our patients and consumers all over the world. Despite the proponent's reliance
on limited and one-sided studies and polls, many well respected organizations and regulatory agenciesincluding the United States Food and Drug Administration, the American
Medical Association, the European Food Safety Authority, Health Canada, the Food Standards Agency of Australia New Zealand, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations among othershave judged the science supporting the safety of genetically modified ingredients to be reliable. 
Abbott
follows a careful and comprehensive process to determine appropriate ingredients, based on a thorough evaluation of safety, sound science, quality and regulatory requirements. In contrast, the
proponents seek to limit the use of ingredients that have been accepted and determined by global regulatory bodies as safe without regard to the issues of availability, consumer preference and in
reliance on a small number of studies that do not represent scientific consensus. 
As
part of our ingredient selection process, it is necessary to consider the availability of ingredient supply. The large-scale production of certain genetically-modified crops has made it difficult
to obtain enough non-GMO supply to meet global demand. Globally, countries have different preferences and requirements around the use and labeling of genetically-modified ingredients and
Abbott fully complies with all local, regional and national standards related to the use and labeling of all ingredients. 

49

 
Biotechnology
has enabled farmers in the United States and worldwide to maintain and improve crop yields, helping farmers to be sustainable and meet the ever expanding demand for food. The
subsequent increase in food products is particularly important for developing countries where nutrition is an ever-growing concern. Genetically modified crops also have the potential to
offer greater resistance to insect infestation and plant disease, allowing for increased crop yields, less use of chemicals and cost to protect plants, and more affordable foods. 
As
a leader in nutrition, Abbott will continue to work to set the standard by delivering products that are grounded in science, meet or exceed regulatory requirements and address the needs and
preferences of our consumers globally. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Shareholder Proposal on Lobbying Disclosure (Item 5 on Proxy Card)     

The AFSCME Employees Pension Plan and six other proponents have informed Abbott that they intend to present the following proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide the proponents' names and
addresses to any shareholder who requests that information and, if provided by a proponent to Abbott, the number of Abbott common shares held by that proponent. 
Whereas,
corporate lobbying exposes our company to risks that could affect the company's stated goals, objectives, and ultimately shareholder value, and 
Whereas,
we rely on the information provided by our company to evaluate goals and objectives, and we, therefore, have a strong interest in full disclosure of our company's lobbying to assess whether
our company's lobbying is consistent with its expressed goals and in the best interests of shareholders and long-term value. 
RESOLVED, the shareholders of Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott") request that the Board authorize the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 

1.Company
policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.
2.Payments
by Abbott used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.
3.Abbott's
membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.
4.Description
of the decision making process and oversight by management and the Board for making payments described in section 2 above. 
For
purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects
a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. "Indirect lobbying" is lobbying
engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Abbott is a member. 
Both
"direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. 
The
report shall be presented to the Audit Committee of the Board or other relevant oversight committees of the Board and posted on the company's website. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

As shareholders, we encourage transparency and accountability in the use of staff time and corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation both directly and indirectly. We believe such
disclosure is in shareholders' best interests. Abbott is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, which is characterized as "by far the most muscular business lobby group in Washington" ("Chamber of
Secrets," Economist, April 21, 2012). In 2010 and 2011, the Chamber spent $198 million on lobbying. Abbott does not disclose its trade association payments or the portions used for
lobbying on its website. Absent a system of accountability, company assets could be used for objectives contrary to Abbott's long-term interests. Abbott spent approximately
$9.5 million in 2010 and 2011 on direct federal lobbying activities, according to Senate disclosure reports. In 2011, Abbott also spent at least $1,027,355 in 18 states that require lobbying
expenditure disclosure (according to state disclosure reports). These figures may not include grassroots lobbying to directly influence legislation by mobilizing public support or opposition and do
not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation or regulation in states that do not require disclosure. 
We
encourage our Board to require comprehensive disclosure related to direct, indirect, and grassroots lobbying. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Lobbying Disclosure (Item 5 on Proxy Card)     

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Abbott's
existing reporting, combined with extensive federal, state and local disclosure, provide transparency into and accountability regarding Abbott's lobbying activities. Preparation and
maintenance of the report requested would expend company funds and resources to produce a document that would not provide meaningful additional insight into Abbott's lobbying activities. Such a waste
of resources is not in the best interests of the Company or its shareholders. 
In
recognition of the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders in information about Abbott's lobbying activities, Abbott already provides extensive information about our political participation
on the "Corporate Political Participation" page of our web site.(1) On this page, Abbott discusses the policies and procedures governing our efforts in the area. Abbott also provides
links to where our federal quarterly lobbying disclosure reports can be found and posts semi-annual contribution reports, which list the candidates and organizations receiving
contributions, as well as the amount of the 

51

 


contributions. Memberships in trade organizations to which Abbott pays dues of $100,000 or more per year are reported annually. Finally, Abbott describes the decision making process and the Board and
Public Policy Committee oversight of our political participation activities, and expressly discloses that we do not currently make direct expenditures towards U.S. federal or state grassroots lobbying
communications to the general public. 
A
significant amount of information is also readily available through other public sources. Payments made for direct federal lobbying consultants or third parties are calculated and included as part
of Abbott's federal quarterly lobbying reports. In those states in which we have a registered lobbyist, reports are filed consistent with state law and are publicly available at the appropriate state
agency, either in the state capitol or on the state's public web site. We and our registered lobbyists also report indirect contributions (such as payments for events honoring covered elected
officials, or entities named for covered legislative officials, or an organization controlled by covered officials, etc.) as part of mandatory Form LD-203 filings, and payments made
by Abbott for outside lobbying services are required to be disclosed by lobbyists on a Form LD-2. Both the Form LD-203 and Form LD-2 are
available and searchable in the lobbying disclosure web sites of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chair (Item 6 on Proxy Card)     

The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' Pension Benefit Fund, 900 Seventh Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001, has informed Abbott that it intends to present the following proposal at the
meeting and that it owns 64,806 Abbott common shares. 
RESOLVED: The shareholders of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") urge the Board of Directors to adopt a policy that the Board's chairman be an
independent director. The policy should be implemented so as not to violate any contractual obligation and should specify: (a) how to select a new independent chairman if a current chairman
ceases to be independent during the time between annual meetings of shareholders; and, (b) that compliance with the policy is excused if no independent director is available and willing to
serve as chairman. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to protect shareholders' long-term interests by providing independent oversight of management. By setting agendas, priorities and
procedures, the position of Chairman is critical in shaping the work of the Board. 
In
our opinion, a board of directors is less likely to provide rigorous independent oversight of management if the chairman is the CEO, as is the case with our Company. CEO Miles D. White has served
as both Chairman and CEO since 1999. 
We
believe that having a board chairman who is independent of the Company and its management is a governance practice that will promote greater management accountability to shareholders and lead to a
more objective evaluation of management. 
According
to the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance (Yale School of Management), "The independent chair curbs conflicts of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the
relationship between the board and CEO, serves as a conduit for regular communication with shareowners, and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board." (Chairing the Board: The
Case for Independent Leadership in Corporate North America, 2009). 
An
NACD Blue Ribbon Commission on Directors' Professionalism recommended several years ago that an independent director should be charged with "organizing the board's evaluation of the CEO and provide
ongoing feedback; chairing executive sessions of the board; setting the agenda and leading the board in anticipating and responding to crises." A blue-ribbon report from The Conference
Board echoed that sentiment a few years later. 
A
number of institutional investors believe that a strong, objective board leader can best provide the necessary oversight of management. Thus, the California Public Employees' Retirement System's
Global Principles of Accountable Corporate Governance recommends that a company's board should generally be chaired by an independent director, as does the Council of Institutional Investors. We thus
believe that an independent director serving as chairman can help ensure the functioning of an effective board. We urge you to vote FOR this resolution. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chair  (Item 6 on Proxy Card)     

The Board recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Abbott's
shareholders are best served by giving the Board flexibility to select the individual best suited to serve as Chairman. Effective corporate governance is not merely a "one size fits all"
checklist, and it is unwise to place arbitrary constraints on the Board's ability to determine the most effective leadership structure for the Company. 
At
present, Abbott's shareholders are best served by Abbott's CEO also serving as the Chairman of the Board. With this structure, Abbott benefits from coherent leadership and direction for the Board
and executive management, with clear accountability and a single focus for the chain of command to execute Abbott's strategic initiatives and business plans. In addition, the CEO's extensive industry
expertise, leadership experience and familiarity with Abbott's complex business make him uniquely qualified to lead discussions on important matters affecting the Company. With the CEO both leading
management and chairing the Board, Abbott continues to benefit from his strong leadership skills and strategic and operational insights throughout the entire continuum of challenges it
facesenabling a focused vision that encompasses the full range from long-term strategic direction to day-to-day operational execution. 
The
Board regularly reviews this leadership structure and has taken numerous measures to create a balanced governance structure that ensures substantial independent oversight of Abbott's management.
The Board is composed of 11 individuals, all of whom, other than the Chairman, are independent, and all members of each of the key Board committeesnamely, the Audit, Compensation,
Nominations and Governance, and Public Policy Committeesare independent. This means that oversight of key matters, such as the integrity of Abbott's financial statements, executive
compensation, the nomination of directors and evaluation of the Board and key committees is entrusted to independent directors. In addition, the CEO's performance is evaluated on an annual basis by
the full board of independent directors. The Board and each of its committees have unrestrained access to management and the authority to retain independent advisors, as they deem appropriate. 

53

 

In
addition, the Board has appointed an independent Lead Director, who is elected by and from the independent board members. The Lead Director facilitates communications with the Board and presides
over regularly conducted executive sessions and sessions where the Chairman is not present. 
Indeed,
Abbott's governance structure is consistent with the majority of S&P 500 companies.(1) In a separate survey of the 100 largest U.S. public, non-controlled
companies that have equity securities listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ, only 9 have adopted an explicit policy of separating the offices of Chairman and CEO and only 12 have an independent
chairman.(2) 
Abbott's
shareholders have repeatedly considered and rejected the proposal that the Company should adopt a policy requiring an independent Chairman. This proposal was most recently defeated at
Abbott's 2012 Annual Meeting, with only 19.5% of shareholders voting in favor of the proposal. The same rationale for opposing this proposal continues to apply today: there are clear advantages to
adopting a flexible, tailored approach to determining a company's governance structure. 
Based
on the foregoing, a policy that requires an independent Chairman is unnecessary and not in the best interests of Abbott and its shareholders. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Shareholder Proposal on Equity Retention and Hedging (Item 7 on Proxy Card)     

The AFL-CIO Equity Index Fund, c/o Chevy Chase Trust Investment Advisors, 7501 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1500 W. Bethesda, MD 20814, has informed Abbott that it intends to present the
following proposal at the meeting and that it owns 315,964 shares of Abbott common stock. 
RESOLVED: Shareholders of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") urge the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") to adopt a
policy requiring that senior executives retain a significant percentage of shares acquired through equity compensation programs until reaching normal retirement age or terminating employment with the
Company. For the purpose of this policy, normal retirement age shall be defined by the Company's qualified retirement plan that has the largest number of plan participants. The shareholders recommend
that the Committee adopt a share retention percentage requirement of at least 75 percent of net after-tax shares. The policy should prohibit hedging transactions for shares subject
to this policy which are not sales but reduce the risk of loss to the executive. This policy shall supplement any other share ownership requirements that have been established for senior executives,
and should be implemented so as not to violate the Company's existing contractual obligations or the terms of any compensation or benefit plan currently in effect. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

Equity-based compensation is an important component of senior executive compensation at our Company. While we encourage the use of equity-based compensation for senior executives, we are concerned
that our Company's senior executives are generally free to sell shares received from our Company's equity compensation plans. In our opinion, the Company's current share ownership guidelines for its
senior executives do not go far enough to ensure that the Company's equity compensation plans continue to build stock ownership by senior executives over the long-term. 
For
example, according to the 2012 proxy statement, our Company's share ownership guidelines require the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") to hold 175,000 shares. In comparison, the CEO currently
owns 1.2 million shares. In 2011, our Company granted the CEO 209,500 performance-based restricted stock and 294,700 stock options. In other words, the equivalent of one year's equity awards is
nearly three times the Company's share ownership guidelines for the CEO. Furthermore, the CEO has an additional 3.6 million in equity awards that will vest over the next eight years. 
Our
proposal seeks to better link executive compensation with long-term performance by requiring a meaningful share retention ratio for shares received by senior executives from the
Company's equity compensation plans. Requiring senior executives to hold a significant percentage of shares obtained through equity compensation plans until they reach retirement age will better align
the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders and the Company. A 2009 report by the Conference Board Task Force on Executive Compensation observed that such
hold-through-retirement requirements give executives "an ever growing incentive to focus on long-term stock price performance as the equity subject to the policy increases"
(available at http://www.conference-board.org/pdf_free/ExecCompensation2009.pdf). 
We
believe that requiring senior executives to only hold shares equal to a set target loses effectiveness over time. After satisfying these target holding requirements, senior executives are free to
sell all the additional shares they receive in equity compensation. 
We
urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Equity Retention and Hedging (Item 7 on Proxy Card)     

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Sensible
share ownership guidelines balance the importance of aligning executives' and shareholders' interest against the need to allow executives to prudently manage their personal financial affairs.
The Board believes that Abbott's current share ownership guidelines strike that balance effectively. By contrast, the proponent's proposal strikes no balance and would unnecessarily damage Abbott's
ability to attract and retain talent. This would be acutely true in the competition for young and mid-career executive talent who would not be able to access the value of their shares for
decades. 
Abbott's
current share ownership guidelines require the Chief Executive Officer to own 175,000 shares and Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents to own 50,000 shares within five years of
their appointment. In each case, the officer is required to retain shares at this level until they retire. These share ownership guidelines are consistent with those adopted by Abbott's peer companies
and by public companies generally and obviously aligns executives' financial success with those of other shareholders. All of Abbott's executive officers are in full compliance with these guidelines,
and many exceed the guideline in practice. As indicated in this Proxy, the CEO holds approximately 25 times the CEO's base salary and the CFO holds approximately 15 times the CFO's base salary.
Clearly, there is no lack of alignment between the interests of shareholders and senior management. 
Moreover,
as more fully described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, Abbott has crafted its compensation program so that approximately two-thirds
of named 

55

 


executive officer compensation consists of long-term equity awards, 75% of which have performance-based vesting criteria. As such, the vast majority of executives' current income can only
be earned in the future through meeting established performance criteria which are directly related to returns for all shareholders. Depriving executives of the ability to realize a reasonable benefit
from increased shareholder value may undermine the alignment between shareholder and executive interest. 
A
requirement to hold 75% of net after-tax shares until retirement would impose upon executives a rigid requirement that would cause these individuals to adopt an
anti-diversification approach to their personal finances. Clearly, this approach would never be suggested by any investment advisor. In the competitive marketplace for executive talent, a
policy so restrictive could motivate critical executives to leave the Company prematurely in order to access the value of their equity compensation and/or impede the Company's ability to attract
talented executives to the Company. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Shareholder Proposal on Incentive Compensation (Item 8 on Proxy Card)     

The Comptroller of the State of New York, Thomas P. DiNapoli, as trustee of The New York State Common Retirement Fund and administrative head of the New York State and Local Retirement Fund, and one
other proponent, have informed Abbott that they intend to present the following proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide the proponents' names and addresses to any shareholder who requests that
information and, if provided by a proponent to Abbott, the number of Abbott common shares held by that proponent. 
RESOLVED that shareholders of Abbott Laboratories ("Abbott" or the "Company") urge the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
"Committee") to adopt a policy that no financial performance metric shall be adjusted to exclude Compliance Costs when evaluating performance against financial results for purposes of determining the
amount or vesting of any senior executive Incentive Compensation award. "Compliance Costs" are expenses or charges associated with any (a) health care compliance investigation, litigation or
settlement, including legal fees and amounts paid in fines, penalties or damages; (b) product recall; and (c) withdrawal of a product from the market. "Incentive Compensation" is
compensation paid pursuant to short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans and programs. The policy should be implemented in a way that does not violate any existing
contractual obligation of the Company or the terms of any compensation or benefit plan. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

As long-term Abbott shareholders, we favor compensation arrangements that reward senior executives for generating sustainable value. To that end, we recognize that it may be appropriate to
adjust financial metrics for incentive compensation awards to exclude the impact of events that are extraordinary or unrelated to management of the core business. We do not, however, believe it is
appropriate to adjust metrics to exclude the financial impact of matters that are central to the company's business. 
Creating
appropriate incentives is especially important, we think, at companies such as Abbott that have settled multiple allegations of health care fraud in recent years, paying fines and penalties
totaling billions of dollars. Most recently, in May 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Abbott pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $1.5 billion to resolve its criminal and civil
liability arising from the Company's unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote. 
According
to Abbott's 2011 proxy statement, the Committee adjusted a metric to remove the impact of certain Compliance Costs. Specifically, consolidated net earnings were adjusted by six cents per
share for costs of a product recall and drug withdrawal in 2010. (2011 Proxy Statement at 14) 
Although
the proxy statement does not identify the products involved, Abbott's press release discussing fourth quarter 2010 financial results refers to a nutritional product recall announced in
September 2010 and identifies the withdrawn product as sibutramine. (See http://www.abbott.com/PressRelease/ 2011Jan26.htm). The nutritional product recall involved potentially contaminated infant
formula (see http://www.abbott.com/global/url/pressRelease/en_US/Press_Release_0900.htm) and sibutramine was withdrawn because a postmarking study showed that it raised the risk of cardiovascular
events. (See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000097/). 
In
our view, the safety of Abbott's products and the integrity of its manufacturing processes are critical to its long-term success and managing these functions (as well as other health
care compliance-related functions) is a core part of senior executives' stewardship of the business. It is thus not appropriate to exclude the financial impact of these kinds of events from the
metrics used in determining incentive compensation. 
We
urge shareholders to vote for this proposal, which received 34.5% of votes cast at Abbott's 2012 annual meeting. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Incentive Compensation (Item 8 on Proxy Card)     

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Abbott's
methods for evaluating performance against financial results best serve the interests of Abbott's shareholders by providing executives with the ability to make decisions based on Abbott's
long term success, rather than short-term, temporary results. The rigid and formulaic approach advocated by the proponents removes the Compensation Committee's ability to review Abbott's
executive compensation program, including incentive plan performance measures, for susceptibility to adverse or risky behaviors and to make adjustments to compensation awards to address compliance
issues, even when appropriate. In this way, the proposal obstructs the alignment of executive and shareholder's interests. 
The
proposal disregards the need to analyze the facts and circumstances of a particular situation. For example, in some circumstances, it may be in the best interests of shareholders to settle a legal
or compliance matter, such as when the costs of 

57

 


defense outweigh the benefits, or when the outcome is uncertain. In other circumstances, pursuing costly litigation or conducting internal investigations to ensure the safety of our products as well
as compliance with the law and the Company's policies and procedures may be appropriate and key to our future success. Likewise, an event such as a voluntary recall of a product often reflects
Abbott's commitment to product safety and patient and consumer health and is consistent with the long-term reputation and value of the Company. 
The
proposal's one-size-fits-all methodology also fails to consider that compliance matters frequently relate to events that occurred prior to the appointment of
the executive team responsible for resolving such matters and thus may be irrelevant to an evaluation of their performance. If approved, the rigid and formulaic approach advocated by the proposal
would remove the Compensation Committee's ability to consider these and other factors in determining executive compensation and provide incentives for Abbott decision-makers to base their
determinations on the short-term, least costly method of resolution, without regard to what is most beneficial to Abbott and its stakeholders in the long term. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Shareholder Proposal on Accelerated Vesting of Awards Upon Change in Control (Item 9 on Proxy Card)     

The Marco Consulting Group Trust I, 550 W. Washington Boulevard, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60661, has announced that it intends to present the following proposal at the meeting and that it owns
37,577 shares of Abbott common stock. 
RESOLVED: The shareholders ask the board of directors to adopt a policy that in the event of a change in control (as defined under any applicable
employment agreement, equity incentive plan or other plan), there shall be no acceleration of vesting of any equity award granted to any named executive officer, provided, however, that the board's
Compensation Committee (the "Committee") may provide in an applicable grant or purchase agreement that any unvested award will vest on a partial, pro
rata basis up to the time of the named executive officer's termination, with such qualifications for an award as the Committee may determine. 
For
purposes of this Policy, "equity award" means an award granted under an equity incentive plan as defined in Item 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which addresses
executive compensation and named executive officer (or "executive") are those persons covered under Items 401 and 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K . This resolution shall be
implemented so as not affect any contractual rights in existence on the date this proposal is adopted. 

 
 
  Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     

SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
Abbott
Laboratories (the "Company") allows executives to receive an accelerated award of unearned equity under certain conditions after a change of control of the Company. We do not question that some
form of severance payments may be appropriate in that situation. We are concerned, however, that current practices may permit windfall awards that have nothing to do with an executive's performance. 
According
to last year's proxy statement, a change in control at the end of the 2011 fiscal year could have accelerated the vesting of $56 million worth of equity awards to Abbott Laboratories'
top five executives, with the Chairman and CEO, Mr. White, entitled to $26 million. 
In
this regard, we note that the Company's stock programs use a "double trigger" mechanism for equity awards, meaning executives are entitled to receive the accelerated vesting of awards in a change
in control only if there is a termination in employment as defined in the plan or agreement. 
We
are unpersuaded by the argument that executives somehow "deserve" to receive unvested awards. To accelerate the vesting of unearned equity on the theory that an executive was denied the opportunity
to earn those shares seems inconsistent with a "pay for performance" philosophy worthy of the name. 
We
do believe, however, that an affected executive should be eligible to receive an accelerated vesting of equity awards on a pro rata basis as of his
or her termination date, with the details of any pro rata award to be determined by the Committee. 
Other
major corporations, including Apple, Chevron, Dell, ExxonMobil, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Occidental Petroleum, have limitations on accelerated vesting of unearned equity, such as providing pro
rata awards or simply forfeiting unearned awards. 
We
urge you to vote FOR this proposal. 

 
 
  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Accelerated Vesting of Awards Upon a Change in Control  (Item 9 on Proxy Card)     

The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 
Abbott's
policies on treatment of outstanding equity awards upon a change in control serve the best interests of Abbott's shareholders by creating retention incentives that enable employees to avoid
distractions and potential personal conflicts of interest at a critical juncture for the Company, thus promoting a continued focus on the business and reducing the risk of management turnover. The
proposal would eliminate the Board's ability to exercise its business judgment in designing equity awards that it believes are in the best interest of Abbott's shareholders and competitive in the
marketplace. 
Responsive
to discussions with investors in 2012, for future grants to its senior executives, the Compensation Committee eliminated the single-trigger provision of its equity award plans that
accelerated the vesting of equity awards merely upon a change in control. Consequently, accelerated vesting will now be limited to the circumstance wherein, within six months prior to and through two
years after a change in control, an award holder's employment is terminated without cause, or the executive resigns for good reason, as defined by the plan agreement, but simply put, results in the
diminution of the executive's compensation or other material terms and conditions of employment. 
This
amendment, thereby, replaced the single-trigger approach the proponents oppose with a double-trigger, that is activated only when the executive experiences a real and significant loss without
cause. The Board believes that this approach promotes stability and focus during an uncertain time by ensuring that executives do not risk a substantial loss by supporting a transaction that is in the
best 

59

 


interest of shareholders, but would cause them to lose their jobs or suffer a material financial loss through no fault of their own. 
The
proposal seeks to substitute the proponent's view that the amount of time an executive is employed represents the extent to which an award is "earned" for the Compensation Committee's considered
judgment. Contrary to the proponents, the Committee believes that an executive should not be deprived of the opportunity to realize the full value of a previously-granted equity award due following a
change in control because the award (and the opportunity to vest in the award) is part of the executive's total compensation package. Abbott is committed to a pay-for-performance
philosophy and as such roughly two-thirds of named executive officers' total compensation is comprised of equity awards whose value is realized over three to five years based on continued
service and/or the achievement of pre-determined performance criteria. Putting executives in a position to lose the opportunity to earn these awards undermines the pay for performance
objectives of this balance. 
We
note that the vast majority of S&P 500 companies provide single- or double-trigger accelerated vesting of equity upon a change in control, without pro-ration. Adoption of the
proposal would put Abbott executives in a worse position than those at most other large public companies, including most of our peer companies, thus impairing our ability to attract and retain highly
qualified executives. 
Finally,
the proponent's proposal that senior executives be treated differently than all other plan participants serves no legitimate shareholder interest and undermines the objectives stated above. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance     

One report for David Forrest, reporting a sale of shares, was filed late and one report for Richard A. Gonzalez, reporting a gift of shares, was filed late by Abbott. 

 
 
  Other Matters     

In accordance with Abbott's articles of incorporation, Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of two current and five former officers in connection with the United States Department of Justice's
criminal and civil investigation of Abbott's Depakote sales and marketing activities. 
In
2011 and 2012, shareholder derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the Circuit Court for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit, Lake
County, Illinois, against Abbott and certain current and former directors and officers alleging breaches of fiduciary responsibilities in connection with Depakote's sales and marketing activities.
Plaintiffs seek damages, reimbursement of legal fees and costs, and various other forms of relief. Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of the directors and officers named in these lawsuits. 

 
 
  Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2014 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement     

Shareholder proposals for presentation at the 2014 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 15, 2013 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2014 meeting. 

 
 
  Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting     

A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and governance committee or the secretary
of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these
procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on: 

the
record date for that Annual Meeting,
the
date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and
the
date of the Annual Meeting, 
may
directly nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the secretary of Abbott. 
That
notice must include certain information required by Article II of Abbott's By-Laws, including information about the shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the
nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
For
each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business
at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director nomination,
the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's principal executive offices not less
than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within
twenty-five days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such
notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for the 2014
Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by Abbott no later than January 26, 2014. 
In
addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the Annual Meeting and
as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the secretary of Abbott at Abbott's principal executive offices not more than five
business days after the record date for the Annual Meeting, and not less than eight business days before the date of the Annual Meeting in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as
of ten business days prior to the Annual Meeting.

EXHIBIT A



 
 
  Director Independence Standard     

No director qualifies as "independent" unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Abbott or its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner,
shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Abbott or any of its subsidiaries). In making this determination, the Board shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances,
including the following standards: 

A

has been within the last three years, an executive officer of Abbott or its subsidiaries.
A
director is not independent if the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years,
more than $120,000 in direct compensation from Abbott or its subsidiaries, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such
compensation is not
contingent in any way on continued service), and other than amounts received by an immediate family member for service as an employee (other than an executive officer).
A
director is not independent if (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is Abbott's internal or external auditor;
(B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on Abbott's or its
subsidiaries' audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on Abbott's or its
subsidiaries' audit within that time.
A
director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company
where any of the present executive officers of Abbott or its subsidiaries at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee.
A
director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments to, or
received payments from, Abbott or its subsidiaries for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other
company's consolidated gross revenues.
A
director is not independent if the director is an executive officer of a charitable organization that received charitable contributions (other than matching contributions)
from Abbott and its subsidiaries in the preceding fiscal year that are in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable organization's consolidated gross revenues.
