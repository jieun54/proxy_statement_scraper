The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 29, 2016, at

 DIVERSIFIED GROWTH AND INCOME










Abbott's
investment identity is one of long-term diversified growth and increasing returns to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, Abbott has delivered a cumulative
total shareholder return (TSR) of 123%, significantly outperforming both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over that same time horizon. 
 
 






  5-YEAR TSR*: LONG-TERM GROWTH  Over the past 5 years, Abbott has outperformed both major stock market indices



 




*Source:
Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters applied an adjustment factor to adjust Abbott historical share prices prior to and up through December 31,
2012 to account for the AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) separation, which was effective on January 1, 2013. To accurately reflect the TSR created by Abbott since the AbbVie separation, Abbott uses the
daily dividend reinvestment methodology to calculate TSR. Other financial data providers may use different methodologies to adjust for the AbbVie separation, which may produce different results.

 PEER GROUP










Our investors compare us to other global multinational companies, not necessarily in healthcare. These companies share similar characteristics that
are aligned with our investment identity of diversified growth and returns to shareholders.  
Therefore, our peer group was selected to strike the appropriate balance between size (both revenues and market capitalization), similar return profiles, geographic breadth,
and management and operating structure. The peer group purposely includes companies that are outside the healthcare industry. 
After the separation with AbbVie on January 1, 2013, the peer group excludes companies that focus primarily on proprietary pharmaceuticals. It also
excludes companies whose revenues are predominantly derived from the U.S. as well as small non-diverse healthcare companies. Our investors tell us
that these companies are not viable peers. 
In
selecting our peer group for performance and compensation benchmarking, we considered: 


 Globally diverse manufacturing-driven organizations with significant international operations  
 Consumer-facing organizations 
 Similar financial and operating measures, including market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees  
 Similar return of cash profiles, including dividends and share repurchases 
 Similar geographic mix of revenues and profits

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS










In
2015, we received 96% shareholder support for our annual advisory vote on "Say on Pay" demonstrating strong support for our approach to executive compensation. We
continue to evolve our compensation program based upon feedback we receive during our ongoing shareholder outreach, as well as continual review of market practices. We implemented the following
features to strengthen the alignment between the interests of our executive officers and shareholders. 















 



 RECENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CHANGES




    


 


 






     Increased the ROE target for vesting of
performance shares granted in 2015
(with further increase for performance shares granted in 2016)     Increased director share ownership guidelines     Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology
 






     Revised long-term incentive measures to
reflect sustained performance over a three-year period     Increased disclosure related to payouts for both annual and long-term incentives     Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy     Implemented a strengthened recoupment policy
    




 
  






  KEY FEATURES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM



 
The compensation program for our executive officers includes key features that align the interests of our executive officers with our business
strategies and goals, as well as the interests of our shareholders. The program does not include features that could misalign these interests. 





















 ​
 








 What We Do
 









 What We Don't Do 





​




​


 ​




​



 ​




​


 ​




​


 ​







 
 



 
 Use three performance hurdles to determine long-term incentive awards
    1) 1-, 3-, and 5-year relative TSR determine award guidelines
    2) Individual performance determines percentage of guideline awarded to officer
    3) The ROE target determines award vesting
 



 
 No tax gross-ups under our executive officer pay program






 
 







 


 








 Benchmark peers with investment profile, operating characteristics, and employment and business markets similar to Abbott
 







 


 








 No change in control agreement for the Chief Executive Officer



 
 



 
 Align annual incentive payouts to drivers of shareholder value (growth, EPS, etc.)
 



 
 No employment contracts






 ​
 







 


 








 Provide change in control benefits under double-trigger circumstances only
 






 


 









 No repricing of stock options



 
 



 
 Include forfeiture for misconduct provision in equity grants and recoup compensation when warranted
 



 
 No guaranteed bonuses






 ​
 







 


 








 Require significant share ownership for officers and directors
 






 


 









 No discounted stock options



 
 



 
 Require retention of vested long-term incentive awards until share ownership guidelines are met
 



 
 No hedging of Abbott shares






 ​
 







 


 








 Apply pledging policy for Abbott shares
 






 


 









 No highly leveraged incentive plans that encourage excessive risk taking



 
 



 
 Cap incentive award payments
 



 
 No immediate vesting of stock options or restricted stock

  COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR 2015 NEO PROXY DISCLOSURES



 
Compensation for named executive officers (NEO) is determined by the Compensation Committee based on Company performance relative to our peer group,
officer performance relative to goals, and compensation levels relative to our peer group. Over 80% of our NEO compensation is based on performance. The compensation decisions reflected in this proxy
summary are detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) section of the proxy statement. In summary, the Committee decided to:


 Pay executive officers 2015 annual incentives ranging from 54% to 121% of target, with an average of 89% of target.  
 Grant executive officer long-term incentive (LTI) awards in February 2015 ranging from 90% to 125% of guideline, with an average of
104% of guideline. 

 
  






  OVERVIEW OF CHANGES TO INCENTIVE PROCESSES



 
During 2015, we made several changes to our incentive processes in response to shareholder feedback received after the LTI awards described in this
proxy statement were granted. While we are not required to disclose the updates to our LTI process until our 2017 proxy statement, we have included the changes to both our short-term and our long-term
incentive process in this proxy statement to illustrate our responsiveness to our shareholders' feedback. The details of these changes are shown in the CD&A and summarized below. 
Annual
Incentive for 2015, paid in February 2016 and shown in this proxy statement 
The
annual incentive plan was revised to:


 Add a funding trigger of earnings per share (EPS). The EPS goal must be achieved in order for officers to receive a payout from the
plan. 
 Evaluate officers against four specific, documented criteria (Sales Growth, Financial Return, Strategic Initiatives, and Leadership).
The weightings for the criteria vary based on each executive's role. 

Additional
details can be found on pages 32 and 33. 
Preview
of February 2016 LTI Grants, required to be included in our 2017 proxy statement 
As
in prior years, LTI guidelines were set based upon Abbott's 1-, 3-, and 5-year TSR relative to its peers. These guidelines were then adjusted based upon individual officer performance, as in the
past. 
For
the 2016 grants, the individual officer assessment focused on rewarding sustained performance over a three-year period (2013-2015) by scoring each officer's achievements in three categories (Sales
and Market Share Growth, Margin Contribution, and Strategic Milestones) for those three years. With these changes, our LTI plan uses different measures and different measurement periods than those
used for our annual incentive plan. These changes were made based on feedback from our shareholders. 
Additional
details can be found on page 35.

  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING



 
 




Who Can Vote  
Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2016 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of
January 31, 2016, Abbott had 1,473,241,861 outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of
directors and one vote per share on all other matters.  




Notice and Access  
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Notice and Access" rules, Abbott mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials (the "Notice") to certain shareholders in mid-March of 2016. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how the shareholders can access the proxy materials
online. It also provides instructions on how those shareholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a print version of the proxy materials, unless you request one.
If you would like to receive a print version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice.  




Cumulative Voting  
Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one
nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees, as the shareholder desires. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes against a nominee. If shares are voted cumulatively and there are more
nominees than there are director vacancies, nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend
the Annual Meeting.  




Voting by Proxy  
All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. Abbott's By-Laws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two
persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need
to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found with your proxy card or on the Notice.  




Revoking a Proxy  
You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the
meeting:


 by delivering a written notice to the Secretary of Abbott, 
 by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or
 by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy.  





Discretionary Voting Authority  
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies
they receive to elect the 11 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the Board of
Directors, or for fewer than 11 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively in
their sole discretion so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. The proxy holders
may not cast your vote for any nominee from whom you have withheld authority to vote. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors or the advisory vote on the approval of executive
compensation or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will
be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors and FOR the approval of executive compensation.

Table of Contents
With
the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Board of Directors is not aware of any other issue which may
properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.
 




Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy  
A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter.
 




Effect of Withhold Votes, Broker Non-Votes, and Abstentions  
Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to withhold authority to vote for one or more
directors or to abstain from voting on another matter will have the effect of votes against those directors or that matter. A proxy submitted by an institution, such as a broker or bank that holds
shares for the account of a beneficial owner, may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for
example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not
present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority
to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary
authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors and the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation are "non-routine" matters.
Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting.  




Inspectors of Election  
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not
Abbott employees.  




Cost of Soliciting Proxies  
Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses

  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES



 
 
















 



 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS










The
Board of Directors held six meetings in 2015. The average attendance of all directors at Board and committee meetings in 2015 was ninety-seven percent and each director
attended at least seventy-five percent of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. Abbott encourages its Board members to attend the annual
shareholders meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern,
R. S. Austin, S. E. Blount, W. J. Farrell, E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn,
S. C. Scott III, and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the Board applied the categorical standards attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The Board
also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's
independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which Abbott sold products or made contributions or from
which Abbott purchased products and services during the year. In making its determination, the Board relied on both information provided by the directors and information developed internally by
Abbott. 
The
Board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees.  
















 



 LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE










The
Board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by one individual and an independent
director acts as lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all Board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests
of Abbott and its shareholders. 




Chairman/Chief Executive Officer  


 Coherent leadership and direction for the Board and executive management 
 Clear accountability and a single focus for the chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans  
 CEO's extensive industry expertise, leadership experience, and familiarity with our business  
 By leading management and chairing the Board, we benefit from our CEO's strategic and operational insights, enabling a focused vision
encompassing the full range, from long-term strategic direction and day-to-day execution 





Lead Independent Director  


 Currently, the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee acts as the lead director  
 Chosen by and from the independent members of the Board of Directors, and serves as the liaison between the Chairman of the Board and
the independent directors 
 Facilitates communication with the Board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or
sessions where the Chairman of the Board is not present 
 Reviews and approves matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other Board
members 
 Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors and, if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he or she is
available for consultation and direct communication 
 The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer regarding
appropriate agenda topics and other Board related matters

 DIRECTOR SELECTION










The
Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board the nominees
for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The process used by the Nominations and Governance Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors
depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. 
Abbott's
outline of directorship qualifications, which as part of Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). These qualifications describe specific characteristics that the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board take into
consideration when selecting nominees for the Board, such as: strong management experience and senior level experience in medicine, hospital administration, medical and scientific research and
development, finance, international business, government, and academic administration. An individual nominee is not required to satisfy all the characteristics listed in the outline of directorship
qualifications and there is no requirement that all such characteristics be represented on the Board. 
In
addition, Board members should have backgrounds that, when combined, provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Board candidates will
be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence, and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a
global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the Board of Directors' oversight role with
respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the Board to conclude that the director should serve on the Board.
The directors' biographies are on pages 13 through 18. 
A
description of the procedure for the recommendation and nomination of directors, including by proxy access, is on page 67.  















 



 BOARD DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION










In
the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Nominations and Governance Committee considers the Board's diversity of relevant experience, areas of
expertise, ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. Currently, 50% of the independent directors are women or minorities. 
The
process used to identify and select nominees has resulted in an experienced, diverse, and well-rounded Board of Directors that possesses the skills and perspectives necessary for its oversight
role. All of Abbott's directors exhibit: 















     Global business perspective     Knowledge of corporate governance requirements and
practices
 


     Successful track record 
   High integrity
 


     Innovative thinking 
   Commitment to good
corporate citizenship

*Each
of the committee members is financially literate, as is required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. The Board of Directors has
determined that Roxanne S. Austin, the Audit Committee's Chair, is an "audit committee financial expert."  





Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial
reporting practices and the audit process; the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements; the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance; the performance of
Abbott's internal audit function and internal auditors; and certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. The Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the report of the Audit
Committee is on page 62. 




Compensation Committee  
The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in carrying out the Board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's
executive officers and directors. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the Board and gives its
recommendations to the full Board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending
director compensation, the Compensation Committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. 
This
Committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate
the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or with the listing
rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of the proxy captioned,
"Compensation Discussion and Analysis."

Table of Contents
The
Compensation Committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain, and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The Committee engaged Meridian as its compensation
consultant for 2015. Meridian performs no other work for Abbott. The Committee engages compensation consultants to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation
matters. The consultant and its principal report directly to the Chair of the Committee. The principal meets regularly and as needed with the Committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the
Chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The Committee determines what variables it will instruct the consultant to consider, and they
include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the
marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The Committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to the consultant for these services. Based on its evaluation of Meridian's
independence in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and information provided by Meridian, the Committee determined that the work performed by Meridian does not present any
conflicts of interest. A copy of the Compensation Committee report is on page 41. 




Nominations and Governance Committee  
The Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends
to the Board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders; recommends to the Board the people to be elected as executive officers of Abbott; develops and
recommends to the Board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to Abbott;
and serves in an advisory capacity to the Board and the Chairman of the Board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major changes in the organizational structure of Abbott, and the
conduct of Board activities. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The process used by this Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors depends on the
qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. The process used by the Committee
to identify nominees is described on page 20 in the section captioned, "Director Selection." 




Public Policy Committee  
The Public Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain
areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott. The Committee is governed by a written charter. 




Executive Committee  
The Executive Committee may exercise all the authority of the Board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for
Board action.

(1)Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $10,500 for each month of service as a director
and $1,000 for each month of service as a chairman of a Board committee (other than the Audit Committee). For each month of service on the Audit Committee, the Chairman receives $1,500 and the other
Audit Committee members receive $500. Effective as of May 1, 2016, the Board committee chairman monthly fees will be $2,083.33 for the Audit Committee Chairman, $1,666.66 for the Compensation
Committee Chairman, $1,250.00 for the Public Policy Committee Chairman, and $1,250.00 for the chairman of any other Board committee; in addition, the lead director will earn $2,500 for each month of
such service and will not receive a fee for service as Nomination and Governance Committee Chairman. Fees earned under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the
director, paid in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott), or paid currently into an
individual grantor trust established by the director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon
retirement from the Board of Directors, if later. The director may elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to either a guaranteed interest account or to a stock equivalent
account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account
balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related common stock at year-end.
(2)The
amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low
market prices of an Abbott common share on the date of grant. In addition to the fees described in footnote 1, each non-employee director elected to the Board of Directors at the annual
shareholders meeting receives vested restricted stock units having a value of $135,000 (rounded down) under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program (effective as of the 2016 Annual
Meeting, this will increase to $150,000 (rounded down)). In 2015, this was 2,793 units. The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the
units at the same rate as other shareholders. Upon termination, retirement from the Board, death, or a change in control of Abbott, a non-employee director will receive one share of common stock for
each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. The following Abbott restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2015: R. J. Alpern,
17,984; R. S. Austin, 25,647; S. E. Blount, 11,244; W. J. Farrell, 23,758; E. M. Liddy, 13,411; N. McKinstry, 11,244;

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



















 

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS










 
  






  INTRODUCTION



 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes Abbott's executive compensation program in 2015. Since the long-term incentive (LTI) shown
in this CD&A reflects awards granted in February 2015, we also will preview changes made to our 2016 LTI process in response to shareholder feedback on page 35. 
In
particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and Board of Directors made its compensation decisions for the Company's executives, including the six named officers:
Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration (previously also Chief Financial Officer until
June 1, 2015); Brian B. Yoor, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (effective June 1, 2015); Brian J. Blaser, Executive Vice President, Diagnostic Products;
John M. Capek, Executive Vice President, Ventures; and Michael J. Warmuth, Executive Vice President, Established Pharmaceuticals. 
The
CD&A also describes the pay philosophy the Committee has established for the Company's executive officers, the process the Committee utilizes to examine performance in the context of executive pay
decisions, the performance goals and results for each named officer, and recent updates to our compensation program. 
 
  






  RELATIVE PERFORMANCE



 
In 2015, Abbott achieved another strong year of financial results and returns. Operational sales,
which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, increased 9.1%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), excluding specified items, increased 8.6% vs. 2014, notably outpacing our peer group
averages. Abbott also continued to deliver strong total shareholder returns (TSR) relative to its peer group, with 5-year performance ranked at the 83rd percentile.

 COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPONENTS OF PAY










Abbott
and its Compensation Committee have designed a compensation program to attract and retain executives whose talent and contributions support and advance the profitable
growth of the Company and growth in shareholder value. The program is designed to be:


Competitive: While we target competitive total compensation, actual payouts vary based
upon Company and individual performance. LTI awards are pegged to the appropriate relative Company performance. Each year, we look at LTI market percentiles between the 10th and the
90th to determine appropriate award levels. Actual pay reflects actual performance relative to peers. 
Aligned to our shareholders' interests: Almost two-thirds of our pay is equity-based,
directly tying executive returns with shareholder returns. 
Performance-based: Other than base salary, which is the smallest component of our
executives' compensation, all components of our Total Direct Compensation program (i.e., base salary, annual cash incentive, performance-based restricted stock awards, and stock options) are aligned
with Company and/or division performance. 
Balanced: Short- and long-term objectives focus our executives on actions that create
value today while building for sustainable future success. Our compensation program rewards the achievement of short-term goals and milestones that will accelerate our success over the long-range
plan.

 CHANGES BASED ON SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK AND MARKET PRACTICES










Last
year, 96% of our shareholders approved the compensation of our named executive officers. We reached out to and conducted meetings with investors representing more than
40% of our outstanding shares. In those meetings, we discussed our pay programs broadly, including aspects that were previously subject to shareholder resolutions. Based on shareholder discussions and
recommendations, the Committee, during its annual evaluation of the Company's compensation programs and evolving market practices, made several changes to our programs. 

















  



 RECENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CHANGES
    






 


 






     Increased the ROE target for vesting of
performance shares granted in 2015
(with further increase for performance shares granted in 2016)     Increased director share ownership guidelines     Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology
 






     Revised long-term incentive measures to
reflect sustained performance over a three-year period     Increased disclosure related to payouts for both annual and long-term incentives     Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy     Implemented a strengthened recoupment policy
    




These
changes made in 2015 and 2016 continue our practice of evolving our program based upon shareholder feedback as well as a review of market practices. Over the past several years, we have made
numerous other changes to our program, including:


 Using three performance assessments to determine the amount of equity awards:


 Relative TSR (compared to peer companies)Determines, as an aggregate target, where our equity grant guidelines should be
positioned relative to the market 
 Individual performanceDetermines individual officer awards based on equity grant guidelines (grant guideline x
individual performance factor) 
 The ROE targetEnsures that performance has been sustained before awards vest  

 Granting equity awards with double-trigger vesting in the event of a change in control  
 Eliminating tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Engaging a Compensation Committee consultant that performs no other work for Abbott  
 Adding a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met  
 Revising executive share ownership guidelines:


 Chief Executive Officer6 times base salary 
 Executive Vice President/Senior Vice President3 times base salary  
 All other officers2 times base salary

 HOW EXECUTIVE PAY DECISIONS ARE MADE










The
Committee makes compensation decisions in the context of the objectives of our program. They ensure the compensation delivered to our executives is competitive, based on
performance, balanced between the short- and long-term, and aligned with shareholder interests. 
 
  






  BENCHMARKING USING PEER COMPANIES



 
To determine the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, the Committee, in consultation with its independent consultant, annually
compares the level of compensation, market pay practices, and our relative performance to those of peer companies. 
Our shareholders compare us to other global multinational companies, not necessarily in healthcare. These companies share similar characteristics aligned with our investment
identity of diversified growth and returns to shareholders.  
Therefore, our peer group was selected to strike the appropriate balance between size (both revenues and market capitalization), similar return profiles, geographic breadth,
and management and operating structure. The peer group purposely includes companies that are outside the healthcare industry. 
After the separation with AbbVie, the peer group excludes companies that focus primarily on proprietary pharmaceuticals. It also excludes companies
whose revenues are predominantly derived from the U.S. as well as small non-diverse healthcare companies. Our investors tell us that these companies are not viable peers. 
In
selecting our peer group for performance and compensation benchmarking, we considered:


 Globally diverse manufacturing-driven organizations with significant international operations  
 Consumer-facing organizations 
 Similar financial and operating measures, including market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees  
 Similar return of cash profiles, including dividends and share repurchases 
 Similar geographic mix of revenues and profits 

As
it pertains to healthcare peers, Johnson & Johnson most closely reflects our diversified growth and income identity, as well as the lines of business in which we operate. Other healthcare
companies in our peer group reflect major lines of our business and/or compete directly with Abbott in specific businesses or product areas, while also reflecting our financial and operating scale. 
Although Standard & Poor's has assigned Abbott to the General Industry Classification Standard of "Health Care Equipment," this classification does not accurately
describe Abbott or our peers:


 Less than 50% of our sales are generated by healthcare equipment products; 
 Approximately 50% of our sales are generated by nutritional and pharmaceutical products; and  
 Approximately 50% of our sales are direct to consumers and patients. Therefore, our peer group includes consumer and household product
companies: Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's. 

Our
peer group also includes companies that reflect the breadth of our international operations. We currently generate approximately 70% of our revenues
internationally. 
In
partnership with the Committee's independent consultant and other consultants, this particular set of peer companies was determined shortly after the separation of AbbVie in 2013 to reflect the
nature of our business going forward. In 2015, the Committee reviewed with its consultant and reaffirmed that these companies (after removing Covidien, which was acquired by Medtronic in 2015)
continue to represent an appropriate peer group. This group has been overwhelmingly supported by our investors during shareholder outreach.

​ 


​ 






 
Table of Contents
Given that there had been no significant relative change in Abbott's revenue size or market capitalization, the positive feedback we had
received from investors, and the Committee's strong opinion that stability in a peer group is important, the Committee and its consultant determined that the only change to the peer group would be the
removal of Covidien (which was acquired by Medtronic in 2015).  
This updated group is summarized below, showing the primary characteristics for which each company was selected.

Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) Analysis  
The Company has not changed materially since the separation of AbbVie. We have maintained the same peer group since separation, yet ISS has
significantly changed the peer group used in their analysis each year in the three years since the separation. 
For
their 2014 analysis, ISS selected a peer group which closely matched our own. They selected 16 peers, 13 of which were consistent with the peer group selected by our Compensation Committee. 
Conversely,
for their 2015 analysis, ISS chose to make significant changes to the peer group it used to analyze Abbott's pay and performance. ISS removed five (including Johnson & Johnson, our
most relevant peer) of the 16 peers they used in their 2014 analysis, and added two new peers (Raytheon, a government contractor with little revenue outside the U.S., and Merck, a proprietary
pharmaceutical company which was part of our peer group prior to the AbbVie separation but which is not an appropriate peer for the Abbott of 2015). 
Whereas
the 2014 analysis included 13 of the 19 peers used by our Compensation Committee to make decisions, the 2015 analysis reflected only 9. Therefore, ISS' analysis evolved to rely on only 47% of
our own peers, making it extremely unlikely that the ISS assessment would align with our Committee's assessment.

Such
frequent and cumulative year-to-year changes in the ISS peer group prevent reasonable year-over-year comparisons. In addition, change of this magnitude inherently corrupts an analysis that is
based upon relative measures (which ISS' Relative Degree of Alignment metric is). While we do not yet know ISS' final 2016 peer group, even without change, this group bears little resemblance to the
original peers. This could create the impression that Abbott's pay and performance are not aligned simply due to the frequent change of peers and inclusion of "peers" that were intentionally excluded
by Abbott. 
We
have shared these concerns with ISS and have asked them to reconsider this approach. 
 
  






  FIXED PAYBASE SALARY



 
Base salary targets are set using the median of the peer group as an initial benchmark. Specific pay rates are based on an executive's performance,
experience, unique skills, and internal equity with others at Abbott. Base salaries range from the 10th to the 90th percentile, depending on experience, expertise, unique
role requirements, and tenure, with an average of the 52nd percentile, or essentially at the market median. Once the rate of pay is set at the time of hire or upon promotion, subsequent
changes in pay, including salary increases, are based on the executive's performance, the job he or she is performing, internal equity, and the Company's operating budget. 
 
  






  PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY



 
Abbott's primary performance-based compensation programs for executive officers are the annual cash incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan.
These plans are described in more detail on the following pages. It is important to note that the annual and long-term incentive performance measures differ both in terms of
the measures and the period over which results are assessed. However, both plans are formula-driven based on specific operating, strategic, and leadership results. 
 
  






  ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN (PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN)



 
Our annual cash incentive plan is a key part of our officers' total compensation. It rewards executives for achieving specific annual goals at the
corporate and divisional levels. It also rewards executives for achieving operational and strategic goals. 
During
2015, Abbott's six named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. 
Each
year, the Committee sets the maximum award allocations under the PIP for each named officer as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2015, the maximum award for the Chief Executive
Officer was 0.15% of adjusted consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year-end and, for all of the other named officers, 0.075% of adjusted consolidated net earnings. Historically and in 2015, the
Committee exercised its discretion to deliver PIP awards that were below the maximum awards that are authorized by these formulas based on achieved performance against annual goals and other factors
described below. 




Process to Determine Awards  
Under the PIP, the Committee sets a target payout (expressed as a percentage of base salary) for each officer based upon market benchmarks and
internal equity. The final payout is determined based upon performance relative to annual goals. This process is described below. In 2015, annual incentive payouts for Abbott's executive officers
ranged from 54% to 121% of target, with an average of 89% of target. 


Step One: Fund Annual Incentive Pool Based on EPS Achievement 
In order for the PIP to pay out, the EPS goal (see 2015 Performance Goals for Performance Incentive Plan on page 38) must be achieved. If the
EPS goal is not achieved, then the PIP is not funded and there are no payouts.

Step Two: Assess Individual Performance vs. Goals 
Individual goals are finalized at the beginning of each year based upon each executive officer's responsibilities. The weighting of goals depends
upon whether the executive is a Business Unit leader or a Corporate leader, as follows:

Sales
growth performance required to earn payouts above 100% varies by business to reflect each business's market. To exceed a target payout in Sales
Growth, the business must grow market share, exceeding both peer sales growth rates and Abbott's internal targets. 
 Financial Return GoalsWhile top-line growth is important, that growth must be profitable in order to drive value for our shareholders. To stress the importance of
profitability, each officer is assessed on relevant return goals, primarily earnings, margin contribution, and cash flow.

 Strategic Initiative GoalsStrategic initiative goals are primarily related to key planned strategic actions, such as portfolio expansion, key R&D milestones, gross
margin expansion, and entry into new markets. Strategic goals are set such that fully successful achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout. 100% is the maximum payout and there is no
additional upside. Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0%. 
 Leadership GoalsLeadership goals are primarily related to talent and succession planning initiatives. These goals are focused on stabilizing business leadership
gaps, ensuring businesses have the talent they need to perform in the current period, and building our leadership bench to sustain our performance. Leadership goals are set such that fully successful
achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout. 100% is the maximum payout and there is no additional upside. Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0%.

  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTI)



 
Our long-term incentive plan is the largest component of our executive officers' total compensation. As such, we believe it is critical that Company
and individual performance, on both an absolute and relative basis, are reflected. The LTI process used in February 2015 (described below) resulted in annual grants to executive officers ranging from
the 43rd percentile to the 75th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 54th percentile. A preview of the process used in February 2016 (which
will be disclosed in our 2017 proxy statement) is described on page 35. 




Process to Determine Awards in February 2015, Shown in this Proxy Statement  
Our process for determining guidelines, individual awards, and vesting of those awards
incorporates:


 TSR performance relative to our peers on a one-, three-, and five-year basis  Absolute performance compared to goals for achieving
our long-range plan  Each officer's performance relative to other officers 

This
process is more rigorous than automatically granting LTI at the median and adjusting the awards only for relative TSR at the time the awards vest. 
We
followed a rigorous two-step process in determining awards ultimately received by our executive officers: 
Step
One: Determine LTI Awards
Step Two: Determine if Options and Shares Vest 
Step One: Determine LTI Awards
In
order to determine LTI awards, Abbott follows three steps. 
Step One (A)Company LTI Award GuidelinesAbbott obtains survey data annually to assess the competitive LTI market for our peer
group companies for each executive position. Each year, we position our LTI award guidelines relative to the competitive LTI market by comparing Abbott's TSR performance to our peers. Our February
2015 LTI grants (based on 2014 performance and shown in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement) were set at the 50th percentile of the market based on the Compensation
Committee's evaluation of one-, three-, and five-year TSR performance through 2014, as shown below.

 2015 LTI Award Guideline
 




 
 
50th percentile
 


  





​




​


​




​



​




​


​




​


​








The
2015 LTI award guideline reflects an increase from the 37th percentile that was used for the February 2014 grants, based on the Committee's evaluation of TSR performance through
2013. 
Step One (B)Determine Individual Officer AwardsThe recommendation for each officer starts with the Company LTI award guideline
(based on relative TSR performance as described above) for the officer's position, as established in Step One (A). Individual officer awards are then further adjusted up or down based upon assessment
of: 


1)Performancegoals,
leadership, and sustained performance (Weighted 50%)  2)Long-range
Plan Progresse.g., product approvals, R&D milestones, and margin expansion (Weighted 50%)  3)Impactassessment
of relative contribution to overall enterprise (Modifier of 10% to +10%) 

Awards
granted in 2015, based on individual officer performance in 2014, resulted in awards ranging from 90%125% of guideline award levels, with an average of 104% of guideline. 
Step One (C)Convert Individual LTI Award Values to Equity GrantsIn 2015, to recognize the continued growth focus of Abbott and
to directly align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, the Compensation Committee granted the long-term incentive awards in the form of 50% stock options and 50%
performance-restricted shares. This mix is consistent with the practices of our peer group. 



​ 34      Abbott Laboratories 


​ 


​ 






 
Table of Contents
Step TwoDetermine if Options and Shares Vest
Stock
options vest over three years. Since stock options only accrue value through share price appreciation, the value realized upon the exercise of vested stock options directly aligns the
compensation earned with the value shareholders received over the same period of time. Options are also aligned with shareholder value through the impact of relative TSR in determining the size of
awards granted (Step One). 
Performance-restricted
shares vest 1/3 each year that the performance target is achieved. Vesting is absoluteeither 100% or 0%. There is no partial vesting if the target is
missed or additional vesting upside if the Company over-performs. The Committee believes adjusted return on equity (ROE) is the appropriate performance measure for vesting because ROE measures how
much profit the Company generates over the long-term with the capital that shareholders have invested. 
Although
Company TSR performance and individual officer performance are used in Step One to grant the appropriate award level, the focus on ROE for vesting provides a second shareholder protection to
ensure our growth and investment return objectives are sustained after the initial grant is made. ROE is only used for vesting; it is not used in the determination of LTI award guidelines or
individual officer performance. 
For
grants made in 2015, the ROE vesting target to determine future vesting was set at 11%, which reflected a 10% increase from the grants made in 2014. For grants made in 2016, the ROE target was
increased further to 12%. This increase is consistent with our stated intent to increase our ROE and ROE targets over time. 
Changes Made for February 2016 LTI Awards (Preview of 2017 Proxy Statement)
In
response to shareholder feedback, we changed our approach to determining individual officer LTI awards in February 2016. Details on the individual awards will appear in our 2017 proxy statement
(according to the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements). However, as transparent and timely disclosures to shareholders are important to us, we describe the revised approach,
which was used to determine the February 2016 grants (based on 2015 performance), below. 
The
most significant revisions were to change the: 


1)Measurement
period used to assess individual officer performance to three years to better reflect each executive's impact on Abbott's long-term success. 2)Measures
used to assess individual officer performance so that completely separate measures are used in the annual and long-term incentive plans. 

Our
process continues to look at LTI market data for each executive position based upon percentiles10th, 25th, 40th, 50th,
60th, 75th, and 90th. The Committee examines overall Company performance and sets our LTI award guidelines relative to the market performance by comparing
Abbott's TSR performance to our peers. The market data at that percentile level is then used to determine the total award pool. For example, if based on 1-, 3-, and 5-year TSR performance, the
Committee determines targeted LTI should be at the 37th percentile (as it did for our 2014 grant), then the 37th percentile market data determines the pool for LTI awards
before adjusting for performance, as described below. 
The
actual grant sizes are then directly linked to individual officer performance. We assess officers in three areas: Sales and Market Share Growth, Margin Contribution, and Strategic Milestones over
a three-year period. Each officer is assigned an overall score based on whether they missed, achieved, or exceeded the specific targets in all three measures for all three years. That resulting
assessment score determines the LTI performance adjustment, which ranged from 75% to 125% of the guideline, based on measurement of continuation and sustainability of performance. 
This
new LTI process resulted in annual grants to Abbott executive officers ranging from the 30th percentile to the 68th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 48th percentile. 
Accordingly,
this process delivers a more precise calculation of the Company's actual relative performance and a more differentiated range of individual awards within that pool based on each officer's
individual contribution to overall results.

  PAY DECISIONS FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



 
The following pages highlight the rationale for the pay decisions for each named officer. It is important to note that annual
incentive pay decisions were made in early 2016 on the basis of 2015 results. Long-term incentive decisions (options and performance shares) shown in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy
statement were made in early 2015 based on 2014 results (see prior year proxy statement for discussion of 2014 results). Specific 2015 financial goals are detailed on page 38.

  BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES



 
Each of the benefits described below was designed to support the Company's objective of providing a competitive total pay program. Individual
benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed.

 Retirement Benefits
 


  The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental
 Pension Plan. These plans are described in greater detail in the "Pension Benefits" section of the proxy.    Since officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be
 secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust, officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual
 payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the officers' actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8%) while
 they are employed. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax deferred.    Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the
 grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon retirement from the Company generally follows the manner elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse, depending upon the pension
 distribution method elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan) live beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit and, therefore, exhaust the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension
 Plan benefit will be paid by the Company.
 
 





​




​


 ​




​


 ​




​



​






 
 
 Deferred Compensation
 


  Officers of the Company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary, on a pre-tax basis, to the Company's qualified 401(k) plan, up to
 the IRS contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18% of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan. Unlike other U.S. managers, officers are not eligible to elect to defer compensation into
 the Deferred Compensation Plan. However, one hundred percent (100%) of annual incentive awards earned under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan is eligible for deferral to a non-qualified plan. Officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book
 accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on
 their grantor trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the Company.

 Change in Control Arrangements
 


  Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement. The other named officers have change in control agreements, the purpose of which is to aid in retention and
 recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the Company, and protect the earned benefits of the officer against adverse changes resulting from a change in
 control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to the Committee by its independent compensation consultant. These arrangements are described in greater
 detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.

  SHARE OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION GUIDELINES



 
To further promote sustained shareholder return and to ensure the Company's executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives, the
Company has established share ownership guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the position.

  HEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from entering into or engaging in any financial transaction that is designed to reduce the financial risk
associated with owning Abbott stock. These financial transactions include, but are not limited to, engaging in short sales, derivative transactions (such as equity swaps, straddles, puts, or calls),
and hedging or monetizing transactions (such as collars, exchange funds, or prepaid forward variable contracts) that are linked directly to Abbott stock. 
 
  






  PLEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from holding Abbott stock in a margin account, pledging Abbott stock, or otherwise securing any of their
obligations by assigning Abbott stock as collateral. The Compensation Committee, or its delegate, may grant an exception provided that:


 The director or officer meets Abbott's applicable minimum stock ownership guideline; and  
 Only Abbott stock in excess of the applicable minimum stock ownership guideline is held in the margin account, pledged, or assigned as
collateral.

  RECOUPMENT POLICY



 
In 2015, following discussions by management with shareholders, the Compensation Committee implemented a recoupment policy. The Compensation
Committee has broad discretion to administer and implement the policy and seek recoupment of equity or cash incentive awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in
a supervisory capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that causes significant financial harm to Abbott. The Compensation Committee may recover incentive compensation
awarded to a senior executive in the prior three years or reduce future awards. The policy will not affect awards made prior to its effective date or following a change in control. 
 
  






  COMPLIANCE



 
The Performance Incentive Plan and Incentive Stock Program, which are described above, are intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code
Section 162(m) to ensure deductibility. 
The
Committee reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not
restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, the Committee
may from time to time approve components of compensation for certain officers that are not deductible. 















 

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT










The
Compensation Committee of the Board is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving, and overseeing Abbott's compensation plans and practices, and works with
management and the Committee's independent consultant to establish Abbott's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis with management and has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

 COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT










During
2015, Abbott conducted its annual risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for employees and executives. Abbott's risk assessment is reinforced by
Abbott's adherence to a number of industry-leading best practices, including: 














 
Compensation Committee chaired by independent, non-employee director





 
Representation from the Audit Committee on the Compensation Committee





 
Review of executive compensation programs by the Compensation Committee's independent consultant





 
Robust review of compensation program elements and key performance drivers





 
Detailed measurement of short- and long-term compensation elements to ensure balance




Based
on this assessment, Abbott determined its compensation and benefit programs appropriately align employees and performance without incentivizing risky behaviors. Any risk arising from its
compensation policies and practices is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Abbott or its shareholders. 
The
following factors were among those considered:


 Compensation structure encourages employees to regard Abbott as a career employer, to consider the long-term impact of their
decisions, and to align their interests with those of Abbott's shareholders (e.g., equity awards that vest over multi-year periods, defined benefit pension plan). 
 Abbott's long-term incentive plan focuses on longer-term operating performance and shareholder returns, (e.g., in 2015, roughly 70% of
CEO and 64% of other named officer total compensation was in the form of long-term equity incentives that vest over multiple years). 
 Equity awards are made, and grant prices are set at the same time each year, at the Compensation Committee's regularly scheduled
meeting. In addition, Abbott does not reprice stock options, award discounted stock options, or immediately vest stock options or restricted stock. The equity awards are based on multiple performance
factors, and executive share ownership guidelines and share retention requirements promote alignment with shareholders. 
 Abbott's annual incentive plan places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other factors, including
operational and strategic measures. Since earnings are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of Abbott's compensation plan promotes alignment with shareholder interests without
creating duplication across incentive plans. 
 Abbott's recoupment policy allows the Compensation Committee to seek recoupment of incentive compensation or reduce future awards if
it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that caused significant financial harm to
Abbott. 
 Annual benchmarking ensures performance achievement and incentive payout opportunities are aligned with a peer group that reflects the
investment profile, operating characteristics, and employment and business markets of Abbott. Appropriateness of this group is assessed annually by the Compensation Committee's independent consultant
and approved by the Compensation Committee. 
 Abbott's hedging policy prohibits directors and officers from entering into financial transactions designed to reduce the financial
risk associated with owning Abbott shares. 
 Abbott's pledging policy prohibits directors and officers from holding Abbott shares in a margin account, pledging Abbott shares, or
securing obligations by assigning Abbott shares as collateral unless granted an exception by the Compensation Committee. 
 Training on code of business conduct and policies and procedures is mandatory for all employees and non-employee directors.  
 Abbott's compensation program does not include features that could encourage excessive risk taking, such as over-weighting toward
annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, uncapped incentive award payments, unreasonable thresholds, or steep payout cliffs at certain levels that may encourage short-term business decisions
to meet payout thresholds. 

This
assessment was discussed with the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant. The Committee and the consultant both agreed with the assessment.

(1)Effective
June 1, 2015, Mr. Freyman was appointed Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration and Mr. Yoor was
appointed Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Prior to assuming his current role, Mr. Freyman served as Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Yoor continues to report to Mr. Freyman in his new role.
(2)In
a typical year, such as 2015 and 2013, Abbott's U.S. salaried employees are paid on a bi-weekly 26 pay period schedule. 2014 included an
extra pay period for Abbott's U.S. salaried employees, resulting in salaries approximately 3.8 percent higher than in a typical year having 26 pay periods.
(3)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of
the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines grant date fair value by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high
and low market prices of an Abbott common share on the award's date of grant.
(4)When
Abbott and AbbVie separated on January 1, 2013, all holders of outstanding Abbott equity awards received (except where prohibited
by local law) an identical number of AbbVie equity awards to preserve the value of the initial Abbott awards. Because these AbbVie awards resulted from an anti-dilution adjustment pursuant to the
terms of Abbott's Incentive Stock Programs meant to preserve the value of the existing Abbott awards, they have no impact on the amounts set forth in the table.
(5)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of
the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model.
These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined
using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. For options other than the replacement options, the assumptions are the
same as those described in Note 9, entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" in Abbott's 2015 Annual Report on 




​ 


​ 


​ Abbott Laboratories      43 






 
Table of Contents


Securities
and Exchange Commission Form 10-K. For Abbott replacement options, the model used the following assumptions: expected volatility of 14%; dividend yield ranging between 1.6% and 1.7%;
risk-free interest of 0.1%; and an option life equal to 60% of the option's remaining life. For AbbVie replacement options, the model used the following assumptions: expected volatility of 32.63%;
dividend yield of 4.5%; risk-free interest of 0.1%; and an option life equal to 60% of the option's remaining life.  


(6)These
amounts include the grant date fair values of $1,407,620 and $57,358 attributable to replacement stock options issued in 2013 to
M. D. White and T. C. Freyman, respectively, with respect to original option grants made before 2005. No options with a replacement option feature remain outstanding. Prior
to 2014, when the exercise price of an Abbott option with a replacement feature was paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise price or the withholding taxes
resulting on exercise of that option were paid) with Abbott common shares held by the named officer, an Abbott replacement option may have been granted for the number of shares used to make that
payment. The closing price of an Abbott common share on the business day before the exercise was used to determine the number of shares required to exercise the related option and the exercise price
of the replacement option. The replacement option was exercisable in full six months after the date of grant, and had a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option. Other terms and
conditions of the replacement option award were the same in all material respects to those applicable to the original grant. AbbVie replacement options had substantially similar terms, except that
AbbVie common stock was used to pay for the exercise price or withholding taxes.
(7)This
compensation is earned as a performance-based incentive bonus, pursuant to the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan.
Additional information regarding the Performance Incentive Plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay
Decisions Are MadeAnnual Cash Incentive Plan."

Management
Incentive Plan). These amounts include the trusts' earnings (net of the reportable interest included in footnote 8).  


Employer Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans
M. D. White:
$95,000 / $98,654 / $95,000; T. C. Freyman: $48,755 / $50,630 / $48,488;
B. B. Yoor: $21,894; B. J. Blaser: $33,750 / $34,500 / $30,730; J. M. Capek $33,750 / $34,840; and M. J. Warmuth: $33,750.
These
amounts include employer contributions to both Abbott's tax-qualified defined contribution plan and the Abbott Laboratories 401(k)
Supplemental Plan. The Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan permits Abbott's officers to contribute amounts in excess of the limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions
to 401(k) plans up to the excess of (i) 18% of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to Abbott's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Abbott matches participant contributions at the
rate of 250% of the first 2% of compensation contributed to the plan. The named officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by
the officer, net of maximum tax withholdings.
Other Compensation
Messrs. White's
and Freyman's non-business-related flights on corporate aircraft are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant
to which they reimburse Abbott for certain costs associated with those flights in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. The following amounts are included in the totals in this
column, which reflect Abbott's incremental cost less reimbursements for non-business-related flights: M. D. White: $216,811 / $217,954 / $218,280; and
T. C. Freyman: $15,972 / $9,682 / $15,687.
Abbott
determines the incremental cost for flights based on the direct cost to Abbott, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees,
catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous direct costs.
For
Mr. White, the following costs associated with security are included: $212,350 / $193,040 / $182,880. Abbott determines
the cost for these expenses based on its actual costs. The security is provided on the recommendation of an independent security study.
Also
included in the totals shown in the table is the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the officer:
T. C. Freyman: $18,916 / $15,395 / $12,199; B. B. Yoor: $18,295; B. J. Blaser: $22,236 / $27,867 / $27,016;
J. M. Capek: $18,300 / $18,710; and M. J. Warmuth: $7,748. The amount paid to Mr. Warmuth was paid in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at the
December 31, 2015 exchange rate of 1.0045 U.S. dollars to the Swiss Franc.
For
Messrs. Freyman, Blaser, and Warmuth, the following costs associated with financial planning are included:
T. C. Freyman: $4,497 / $3,449 / $10,000; B. J. Blaser: $7,487 / $0 / $6,500; and M. J. Warmuth: $10,000.
For
Mr. Warmuth, this amount includes $167,659 for expatriate program benefits and $590,815 for tax equalization payments (to avoid
double taxation in the United States and Switzerland) under Abbott's program for employees working on expatriate assignments. The tax equalization payments were in Swiss francs and converted to U.S.
dollars at the December 31, 2015 exchange rate of 1.0045 U.S. dollars to the Swiss franc.
The
named officers are also eligible to participate in an executive disability benefit described on page 58.

(1)During
2015, each of the named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, an annual, non-equity
incentive plan. The annual cash incentive award earned by the named officer in 2015 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table under the column captioned, "Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation." No future payouts will be made under the plan's 2015 annual cash incentive award. The Performance Incentive Plan is described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement
captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are Made."
(2)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a 5-year term and vest upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target,
with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2015, Abbott reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards made on February 20, 2015,
vested on February 29, 2016. The equity targets are described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeLong-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)."
(3)In
the event of a grantee's death or disability, these awards are deemed fully earned. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control
is described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at
the same rate as all other shareholders.
(4)Options
with respect to one-third of the shares covered by these awards are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all
after three years. The options vest in the event of the grantee's death or disability. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control is described in the section of the proxy statement
captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal
to the average of the high and low market prices (rounded-up to the next even penny) of an Abbott common share on the date of grant. These options do not contain a replacement option feature.
(5)Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of restricted shares granted by the average of the high
and low market prices of a common share on the grant date.
(6)These
values were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The model uses the assumptions
described in Note 9, entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" in
Abbott's 2015 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.

 PENSION BENEFITS










During
2015, the named officers participated in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature Abbott uses to attract officers who are at the
mid-point of their careers. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have spent most of their careers at Abbott. Except as
provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change in control agreements are described on
pages 58 and 59. 
The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary
Compensation Table on page 43. 
 
  






  ANNUITY RETIREMENT PLAN



 
The Annuity Retirement Plan covers most employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at
normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  

A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings
multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 0.50% of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social
security wage base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit service.
C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 
The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and
employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Annuity Retirement Plan
covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003 who terminate
prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to
age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50
with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55.

Table of Contents
The
Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Employees
who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with
10 years of service. Employees hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit service
total 70 or more. Messrs. White, Freyman, and Warmuth are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching
age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit
is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement:


 In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that
payments are made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62.  
 Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55
with age plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at
least 94 before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement
applies, Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 12/3 percent for
each year between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per
year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made
before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 
  






  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN



 
With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement
Plan:


 Officers' 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest
years of payments under Abbott's non-equity incentive plans. 
 The Annuity Retirement Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation
Plan in its calculation of a participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred
by a participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election as an officer, Abbott officers are no longer eligible
to defer compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Annuity Retirement Plan, officers are eligible for a benefit equal to 0.6% of
5-year final average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum
percentage allowed under the Annuity Retirement Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B, and C above). The portion of this additional officer benefit attributable to service prior to 2004 is
reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year
for each year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion
attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
 The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The
benefits provided to Abbott's officers under the Supplemental Pension Plan are reduced from the plan's unreduced retirement age, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65.
Messrs. White, Freyman, and Warmuth are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan.

Table of Contents


 Vested plan benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the officer.
Consistent with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those officers who were elected prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested
plan benefits funded through a grantor trust. Officers elected after 2008 may only have the vested plan benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which the officer is first elected funded
through a grantor trust. Vested plan benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the
participants' income. 

Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental
Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

(1)Abbott
calculates these present values using: (i) a 4.86% discount rate, the same discount rate it uses for Financial Accounting
Standards Board ASC Topic 715 calculations for financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's unreduced retirement age. The present values shown in the table reflect post-retirement
mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2006 Combined Healthy table), but do not include a factor for pre-retirement termination, mortality,
or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension
Plan benefits, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the officer's individual
trust are expected to offset Abbott's obligations to the officer under the plan. During 2015, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established
by the named officers. Grantor trusts are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisBenefits and Perquisites."

(1)Mr. Blaser's
contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan ceased after he became an Abbott officer.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 75 percent of their base salary and up to 100 percent of their annual cash
incentives and credits a participant's account with an amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under Abbott's tax-qualified defined
contribution plan. Participants may direct the investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral and the deferral account are
credited with investment returns based on the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2015, the weighted average rate of return credited to Mr. Blaser's account was (2.6) percent.
The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals
in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the
hardship.
(3)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(4)The
amounts reported in this column have not been previously reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table because they relate to
contributions made before Mr. Blaser became a named officer.

 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL










 
  






  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATIONGENERALLY



 
Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. 
The
following summarizes the payments that the named officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2015. Earnings would have continued to be paid to the named
officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend
on the period over which the trusts' assets were distributed and the trusts' earnings. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current earnings, the named officers
would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period:


 M. D. White, $1,043,664 
 T. C. Freyman, $187,813 
 B. B. Yoor, $5,294 
 B. J. Blaser, $103,755 
 J. M. Capek, $117,891 
 M. J. Warmuth, $191,006 

In
addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for the following named
officers:


 B. B. Yoor, $99,812 
 B. J. Blaser, $86,239 
 J. M. Capek, $21,484 
 M. J. Warmuth, $549,063 

If
the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers also would have received, in addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability
benefit in the amount of:


 M. D. White, $165,000 
 T. C. Freyman, $50,950 
 B. B. Yoor, $21,375 
 B. J. Blaser, $35,000 
 J. M. Capek, $29,250 
 M. J. Warmuth, $35,000 

This
long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the officer retires, recovers, dies, or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In
addition, if the named officer's employment had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31, 2015 with
values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Equity Awards." 
 
  






  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL



 
Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement with Abbott. 
Abbott
has change in control arrangements with other key members of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for certain other
management personnel. The agreements with Messrs. Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, Capek, and Warmuth are described below. 
Each
change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2016, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal
is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the
one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also 



​ 58      Abbott Laboratories 


​ 


​ 






 
Table of Contents
automatically
extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years
following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this
purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and
the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid
bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for
good reason during a potential change in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of
the bonus to which the officer is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the
potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer
in the preceding three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including
welfare benefits, outplacement services and tax and financial counseling, and the value of three more years of pension accruals). 
If
change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, payments under the agreement will be reduced to
prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the executive in a better after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit
the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. 
For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the
outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors whose appointment was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under the agreements
includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the executive's
position, duties, or authority; Abbott's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of Abbott's principal executive offices
to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2015 immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Messrs. Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, Capek, and Warmuth would
have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements:

  EQUITY AWARDS



 
Under Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, upon a change in control, the surviving company may assume, convert, or replace awards to
executive officers on an equivalent basis. If the surviving company does not do so, then the awards vest. If the surviving company does assume, convert, or replace the awards on an equivalent basis,
then the awards vest if the officer's employment is terminated without cause or the officer resigns for good reason during the period six months prior to and through two years after a change in
control. The term "good reason" has the same definition as in the change of control agreements. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2015, and the surviving company did not assume, convert, or replace the awards, then Messrs. White, Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, Capek, and
Warmuth would have vested in the following options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units:

  RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS AUDITORS  (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Abbott's By-Laws provide that the Audit Committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve
as auditors. In October 2015, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to act as auditors for 2016. Ernst & Young LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2014. 
Although
the Audit Committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2016.
For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2016, the Audit Committee will
take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2016.  
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They
will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
 
  






  AUDIT FEES AND NON-AUDIT FEES



 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and fees billed for other services rendered by Ernst & Young during these periods.

  POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR




 
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent
auditor and its related affiliates. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm
and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered
public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent
registered public accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at
its next scheduled meeting.  















 



 REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE










Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing
an audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this
context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered
public accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 16  (Communications with Audit Committees),
 as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 61 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees" is
compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  SAY ON PAYAN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange
Commission rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related material included in this proxy statement. 
As
noted in our proxy summary, 2015 was another strong year of financial results and returns. Operational sales, which excludes the impact of foreign
exchange, increased 9.1% and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), excluding specified items, increased 8.6% vs. 2014, notably outpacing our peer group averages. Abbott also continued to deliver
strong total shareholder return (TSR) relative to its peer group with 5-year performance ranked at the 83rd percentile. 



See
Annex I for a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. 
Abbott
delivered that 83rd percentile performance during the period 2011-2015 by producing a 123% cumulative return to our shareholders. During that same period, our CEO's compensation
declined by nearly 20% as a result of aligning our pay practices to the new peer group that was selected following the separation with AbbVie on January 1, 2013. 



* Cumulative TSR of investment initiated at beginning of performance period. 
Source Thomson Reuters. Thomson Reuters applied an adjustment factor to adjust Abbott historical share prices prior to
and up through December 31, 2012 to account for the AbbVie separation, which was effective on January 1, 2013. To accurately reflect the TSR created by Abbott since the AbbVie
separation, Abbott uses the daily dividend reinvestment methodology to calculate TSR. Other financial data providers may use different methodologies to adjust for the AbbVie separation, which may
produce different results.

Table of Contents
Over the past several years, we described in our proxy statement the many changes we made to our executive compensation program following the separation with
AbbVie, including: 




 Selected a new peer group that reflects the globally diverse and consumer-facing aspects of Abbott  
 Increased executive share ownership guidelines 
 Granted LTI awards based on broader view of long-term performance 
 Added a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met  
 Eliminated single-trigger vesting of equity in the event of a change in control 
 Eliminated tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Reduced CEO annual incentive target from 200% to 160% to align with the practices of the new peer group  
 Retained an independent Compensation Committee consultant who performs no other work for Abbott 



We
received positive feedback on these changes from our shareholders during our extensive shareholder outreach, in particular regarding the changes to our peer group. Our Say-on-Pay Vote in 2015
resulted in 96% of shareholders voting "FOR" our executive compensation program. 
During
2015 and 2016, we made additional changes to our executive compensation program based on feedback from our shareholders, including: 




 Increased the ROE target for vesting of performance shares granted in 2015 and again in 2016  
 Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy 
 Increased director share ownership guidelines 
 Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology 
 Revised long-term incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period  
 Increased disclosure related to payouts for annual and long-term incentives 
 Implemented a strengthened recoupment policy 



The
Compensation Committee, with the counsel of its independent consultant, concluded that the compensation reported herein was earned and appropriate. The specific details of the executive
compensation program and compensation paid to the named executive officers are described on pages 27 through 41 of this proxy statement. 
While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results and take into account the
results and our ongoing dialogue with shareholders when future compensation decisions are made. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers' compensation.

  APPROVAL PROCESS FOR RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS



 
It is Abbott's policy that the Nominations and Governance Committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott
participates and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal
year. Related person transactions requiring review by the Nominations and Governance Committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:


 questionnaires annually distributed to Abbott's directors and officers; 
 certifications submitted annually by Abbott officers related to their compliance with Abbott's Code of Business Conduct; or  
 communications made directly by the related person to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel. 

In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Nominations and Governance Committee will consider the following items, among
others:


 the related person's relationship to Abbott and interest in the transaction; 
 the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount
of principal involved; 
 the benefits to Abbott of the transaction; 
 if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;  
 an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to
employees generally; 
 whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and 
 whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 

This
process is included in the Nominations and Governance Committee's written charter, which is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). The spouse of one of our executive officers, Jaime Contreras, is employed by Abbott. During 2015, her total compensation
exceeded the foregoing threshold.

and costs, and various other forms of relief. Abbott advanced defense costs on behalf of the directors and officers named in these lawsuits. As of 2015, these matters were concluded. Abbott
indemnified and advanced defense costs on behalf of the current and former directors and officers named in these lawsuits. Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of a former officer in connection
with the AMO transaction.

 DATE FOR RECEIPT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2017 ANNUAL MEETING PROXY STATEMENT










Shareholder
proposals for presentation at the 2017 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 18, 2016 and must otherwise comply with the
applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2017 meeting.
 
















 



 PROCEDURE FOR RECOMMENDATION AND NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AND TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS AT ANNUAL MEETING










 Proxy Access:    A shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years Abbott common shares representing an aggregate of at
least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, may nominate and have included in Abbott's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided
that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in Abbott's By-Laws. 
Nominating
shareholders are permitted to include in Abbott's proxy statement a 500-word statement in support of their nominee(s). Abbott may omit any information or statement that it, in good faith,
believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state a material fact, or would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    A shareholder may also recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the
names of such persons in writing to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee or the Secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and
confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on:


 the record date for that Annual Meeting, 
 the date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and 
 the date of the Annual Meeting 

may
directly nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the Secretary of Abbott. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    The notice submitted by a shareholder must include certain information required by
Article II of Abbott's By-Laws, including information about the shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or
associates or others acting in concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
For
each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business
at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director nomination, including
through proxy access, the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director, including through proxy access, or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's
principal executive offices not less than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a
date that is not within twenty-five days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on
which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for
the 2017 Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by Abbott no later than January 29, 2017. 
In
addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the Annual Meeting and
as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the Secretary of Abbott at Abbott's principal executive offices not more than five
business days after the record date for the Annual Meeting, and not less than eight business days before the date of the Annual Meeting in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as
of ten business days prior to the Annual Meeting.

  EXHIBIT A



 
 
  






  DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE STANDARD



 
No director qualifies as "independent" unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with
Abbott or its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Abbott or any of its subsidiaries). In making this determination,
the board shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the following standards:


 A director is not independent if the director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries,
or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of Abbott or its subsidiaries. 
 A director is not independent if the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any
twelve-month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from Abbott or its subsidiaries, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of
deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), and other than amounts received by an immediate family member for service as an
employee (other than an executive officer). 
 A director is not independent if (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is Abbott's
internal or external auditor; (B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and
personally works on Abbott's or its subsidiaries' audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally
worked on Abbott's or its subsidiaries' audit within that time. 
 A director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as
an executive officer of another company where any of the present executive officers of Abbott or its subsidiaries at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee.  
 A director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of
a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, Abbott or its subsidiaries for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of
$1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues. 
 A director is not independent if the director is an executive officer of a charitable organization that received charitable
contributions (other than matching contributions) from Abbott and its subsidiaries in the preceding fiscal year that are in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable
organization's consolidated gross revenues.

  ANNEX I



 
 
  






  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION



 
Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures to adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as cost reduction
initiatives, restructuring programs, integration activities and other business acquisition-related costs, separation activities, and favorable adjustments to tax expense as a result of the resolution
of tax positions from a previous year. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs,
similar to how Abbott's management internally assesses performance. 
Abbott's
management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial
measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance. Abbott, however, cautions
investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

acquisition. 
The
