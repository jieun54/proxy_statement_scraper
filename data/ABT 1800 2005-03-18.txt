Abbott Laboratories 
Proxy
Statement 
Solicitation of Proxies  

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 22, 2005, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 18, 2005. 

Information about the Annual Meeting  
Who Can Vote 

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 23, 2005 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2005, Abbott had 1,558,939,682
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
Cumulative Voting 

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees,
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy 

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most
of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting by
telephone or the Internet can be found with your proxy card. 
Revoking a Proxy 

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 

by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott, 

1

 

by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or
by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 
Discretionary Voting Authority 

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 14 nominees named in
Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 14 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer
votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors, or the approval of a shareholder proposal, or where the
shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification
of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors and AGAINST the shareholder proposals. 
The
board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted
in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy 

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on that matter, although these shares may be considered present and
entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies
which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
Inspectors of Election 

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
Cost of Soliciting Proxies 

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Shareholder to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $17,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan 

Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive a voting instruction card for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust
is administered by both a trustee and three co-trustees. The trustee of the Trust is Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are T. C. Freyman,
G. W. Linder, and T. M. Wascoe, officers of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the co-trustees and the
participants. The co-trustees must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions they receive. The co-trustees may use their own
discretion with respect to those shares for which no voting instructions are received. 

2

 

Confidential Voting 

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 




 
where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,




 

where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims,




 

where a shareholder provides comments with a proxy,




 

where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure,




 

to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or




 

in other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors.




Information Concerning Nominees for Directors (Item 1 on Proxy Card)  
Fourteen
directors are to be elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting or until their successors are elected. All of the nominees are currently serving as directors.

The Board of Directors and its Committees  
The Board of Directors 

The board of directors, which held eight meetings in 2004, currently has fourteen members. The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 2004 was 98 percent. Abbott
encourages its board members to attend the annual shareholders meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
board has determined that each of the following directors, who constitute all eleven of Abbott's non-employee directors, is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange
listing standards: R. S. Austin, W. M. Daley, H. L. Fuller, J. M. Greenberg, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr.,
A. B. Rand, W. A. Reynolds, R. S. Roberts, W. D. Smithburg, and J. R. Walter. To determine independence, the board applied the
categorical standards found on Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded
that none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. In making its determination, the board relied on both information provided by the directors and information
developed internally by Abbott. 
The
chairman of the nominations and governance committee acts as lead director to facilitate communication with the board and preside over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent
directors or sessions where the chairman of the board is not present. The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with
the chairman and chief executive officer regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters.  

Committees of the Board of Directors 
The
board of directors has five committees established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy
committee. Each of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee is independent. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, H. L. Fuller, J. M. Greenberg, W. A. Reynolds, and
W. D. Smithburg, did not hold any meetings in 2004. This committee may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law
for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are J. M. Greenberg, chairman, R. S. Austin, D. A. L. Owen, W. D. Smithburg, and J. R. Walter,
held eight meetings in 2004. The committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's
accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process, the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications, independence and performance,
the performance of Abbott's internal audit function and internal auditors, and certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. Each of the members of the audit committee is financially literate, as
required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. The board of directors has determined that both J. M. Greenberg, the committee's chairman, and
R. S. Austin are "audit committee financial experts." A copy of the report of the audit committee is on page 21. 
The
compensation committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, W. M. Daley, H. L. Fuller, J. M. Greenberg,
B. Powell Jr., and A. B. Rand, held three meetings in 2004. The committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in carrying out
the responsibilities of the board relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive officers and directors by discharging the responsibilities set forth in its charter. A copy of the report of the
compensation committee is on pages 13 and 14. 
The
nominations and governance committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, W. A. Reynolds, and
R. S. Roberts, held two meetings in 2004. The committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become
board members and recommends to the board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders, recommends to the board the persons to be elected as executive officers of
Abbott, develops and recommends to the board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to Abbott, and serves in an advisory capacity to the board and the chairman of the board on matters of
organization, management succession plans, major changes in the organizational structure of Abbott, and the conduct of board activities. The process used by this committee to identify a nominee
depends on the qualities being sought. Board members should have backgrounds that when combined
provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Board candidates will be considered on the basis of a range of 

9

 


criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective and commitment
to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board of directors' oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. 
The

Compensation of Directors 
Abbott
employees are not compensated for serving on the board or board committees. Abbott's non-employee directors are compensated for their service under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan and the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program. 
Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $6,667 for each month of service as director and $1,000 for each month of service as
a chairman of a board committee. Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their
fair market value), or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott or paid into a grantor trust established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon
retirement from the board of directors). The director may elect to have deferred fees credited to either a guaranteed interest account at the prime rate plus 2.25 percent or to a stock
equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock
equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the value of Abbott common stock. Abbott pays the director for any tax owed on the income earned by the
trust or any supplemental contribution to the trust by Abbott. 
The
Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program previously provided that each non-employee director elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder meeting earned a restricted stock
award with a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding $65,000. In 2004, this was 1,577 shares. The non-employee directors are entitled to vote these shares and
receive all dividends paid on the shares. These shares were nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of Abbott. 
Since
the last annual meeting, the program has been amended to provide that instead of receiving a restricted stock award each non-employee director elected to the board of directors at the annual
shareholder meeting will, instead, receive restricted stock units covering a number of Abbott common shares having a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding $90,000.
The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the Abbott shares covered by the units. Upon termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of
Abbott, a non-employee director will receive one Abbott common share for each restricted stock unit. In addition, the restrictions on transfer were removed from the Abbott shares that had previously
been issued under the program and from the shares of Hospira received as a dividend with respect to those shares.

Executive Compensation 
Report of the Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is composed entirely of directors who have never been employees of the corporation and who satisfy the independence requirements of the New York
Stock Exchange, Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Committee is
responsible for oversight of the Company's executive officer and director compensation policies and programs, setting its executive officer compensation philosophy and specifically, reviewing, setting
and administering the compensation of Abbott's Chief Executive Officer, and other executive officers and directors. The Committee reviews relative health-care and select high performing
company market data provided by an independent outside consultant when considering programs that govern director and executive officer annual compensation, long-term incentives and stock
ownership programs. 
The
foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles designed to help align the corporation's business strategy, values and management initiatives with shareholder interests.
The Committee annually reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers. The Committee evaluates performance
in light of those goals and objectives as well as performance against certain non-financial goals including development of management talent and other strategic business objectives. 
The
Committee sets the Chief Executive Officer's and other executive officers' compensation based on that evaluation, advice from the Committee's independent compensation consultant, performance
relative to its health-care and high performing company peer groups and shareholder return. 
The
Company's compensation program: 


Integrates
compensation programs which link total shareholder return with both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and measurement
processes.
Supports
a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual performance that is related to both goals and performance of the corporation as compared to that of industry
performance levels.
Helps
attract and retain key executives who are critical to the long-term success of the corporation. 

The
key components of the Company's total compensation program are base salary, annual incentive awards, and long-term incentive awards comprised of various forms of equity awards. These
components are administered with the goal of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace, recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance, and varies the
opportunity based on individual and corporate performance. In determining the long-term incentive component of the Chief Executive Officer's and other executive officers' compensation, the
Committee considers the Company's performance and relative shareholder return, the component mix and value of similar incentive awards to executives at comparable companies, and the awards given to
the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers in past years. 
The
marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation's pay practices to a group of twenty-four major corporations with similar characteristics, including ten within the
health-care industry and eight which are also included in the Standard and Poor's Health Care-500. A select group of high-performing non-healthcare
companies, who are defined as having a five year compounded return on equity (ROE) of 18% or higher and chosen for size and comparability to the corporation, is used as a secondary source of
comparison. Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a range for total compensation and each of its elementsbase, annual incentive and long-term equity-
based compensationis established. The intent is to deliver competitive total compensation that varies with the corporation's relative performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial
portion of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation programs, which are based upon achievement of specific corporate and individual performance goals. Each year the
Committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall objectives discussed above. 
In
2004, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual performance and on the extent to which the business plans for the corporation and their areas of responsibility were achieved or
exceeded. Specifically, for 2004 the Company met or exceeded all of its financial goals and delivered five-year total shareholder returns that were above the seventy-fifth percentile of
the companies in Abbott's health-care peer group. 
The
Abbott Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which limits participation to Senior Officers of Abbott and its subsidiaries and complies with the performance requirements of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue 

13

 


Code of 1986; and the Management Incentive Plan (MIP), in which the other officers of the Company participate, are annual incentive plans designed to reward executives when the Company achieves
certain financial objectives and when each executive's area of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include specific financial targets related to consolidated net earnings,
profitability, total sales and earnings per share. While many aspects of performance can be measured in these financial terms, the Committee also evaluates the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools, including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of management and employees, including Abbott's
diversity initiative and the exercise of leadership within the industry and in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors are collectively taken into account by management and the
Committee when determining the appropriate level of annual incentive awards. 
Each
year, individual base award allocations establish the maximum annual bonus awards for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. Actual awards paid to PIP participants have
historically been below their maximums. 
Each
year, individual incentive targets are established for MIP participants based on competitive survey data from the group of companies discussed above. Under the MIP, 40% of a participant's target
incentive award is attributable to corporate performance relative to its Earnings Per Share target. The remainder of the incentive award is based on the Committee's overall assessment of each
participant's achievement of the predetermined financial and strategic performance goals discussed above. As noted above, awards are paid at levels commensurate with Company and individual performance
and relative to peer group companies. 
For
2004, the corporation achieved or exceeded its predetermined financial goals. As a result, each PIP participant's final award allocation and each MIP participant's incentive award were based on
the corporation's financial goal achievement and the committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
To
motivate and reward its executives and managers and to directly align key employee and shareholder interests, the corporation has provided long-term incentives in the form of equity
participation for many years. Grants of stock options, replacement stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are important parts of this relationship. To ensure this objective
is achieved, executives follow fixed stock ownership guidelines. 
Targeted
ranges and form of equity awards are determined taking into account competitive practice among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation targets are set based on established
salary ranges and may vary based on each executive's performance as determined by the Committee. As noted above, the target ranges and mix of equity awards are established such that equity awards are
appropriately delivered and scaled to the performance of the company within its peer group. Based on its analysis of the competitive equity marketplace and upon the recommendation of its independent
compensation consultant, the Committee has determined that the annual equity award should consist of both stock options and restricted stock awards. For 2004, the equity award component mix was 70%
stock options and 30% restricted stock. 
The
Committee also believes it is critical to periodically award restricted stock as a vehicle to retain key management talent. These stock awards are generally restricted for a 5-year
period. The last such retention award was in 2002. Therefore, it is expected the next restricted stock retention award would be made in 2007. 
The
Company's performance for 2004 as described above and as reflected in the Corporation's financial statements included strong growth in sales, earnings, stock price performance and shareholder
returns that were above the seventy-fifth percentile of the companies in Abbott's health-care peer group. Accordingly, the Committee determined that Mr. White met or exceeded all
strategic and financial goals for 2004. Therefore, in February 2005, the Committee awarded Mr. White a bonus of $2,700,000. 
Other
2004 compensation, recommended and approved as appropriate by the Committee and Board of Directors in February 2004, included a base salary increase of 3.5% to $1,560,000, a 380,000 share
stock option grant (adjusted to 404,340 after the Hospira stock dividend) and a 55,000 share restricted stock award. 
It
is the Committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for executive officers, which operate, in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders in achieving the
corporation's long-term business objectives. To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation
strategy and takes action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

(1)Abbott's
U.S. salaried employees are paid on a bi-weekly pay period schedule. In typical years, such as 2004 and 2002, this results in 26 pay periods. In 2003, the
calendar included an extra pay period for Abbott's U.S. salaried employees resulting in salaries approximately 3.8 percent higher than a typical year having 26 pay periods.
(2)The
number and value of Abbott restricted shares held as of December 31, 2004, respectively, were as follows:
M. D. White - 295,000 / $13,761,750;
J. M. Leiden - 260,000 / $12,129,000;
R. A. Gonzalez - 205,000 / $9,563,250;
T. C. Freyman - 43,000 / $2,005,950; and
W. G. Dempsey - 33,000 / $1,539,450.
As the result of the spin-off of Hospira, Inc. to shareholders on April 30, 2004, the named officers, along with all other Abbott shareholders, received a special dividend
distribution in the form of shares of Hospira, Inc. The number and value of Hospira restricted shares held as of December 31, 2004, respectively, were as follows:
M. D. White - 29,500 / $988,250;
J. M. Leiden - 26,000 / $871,000;
R. A. Gonzalez - 20,500 / $686,750;
T. C. Freyman - 4,300 / $144,050; and
W. G. Dempsey - 3,300 / $110,550.
These Hospira shares are subject to the same restrictions as the related Abbott restricted shares held by the officer. The officers receive any dividends paid on these Abbott and Hospira restricted
shares.
(3)The
number of securities that were outstanding on April 30, 2004 has been adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Hospira, Inc. on April 30, 2004.
(4)These
amounts are employer contributions made to the Stock Retirement Plan and made or accrued with respect to the 401(k) Supplemental Plan.

(1)The
number of securities and exercise or base price have been adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Hospira, Inc. on April 30, 2004.
(2)These
options contain a replacement feature. When the option's exercise price is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise price or
the withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of Abbott's common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number of shares used to make that payment. The
replacement option has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Abbott's common stock on the date the replacement option is granted, is exercisable in full six months after the date of
grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option.
(3)These
values were determined using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. For options, other than replacement options, the model uses the following assumptions: expected
volatility of 32%, dividend yield of 2.2%, risk-free interest of 2.9%, and option life of 5.4 years. For replacement options, the model uses the following assumptions: expected
volatility ranging between 17% and 32%, dividend yield ranging between 2.2% and 2.5%, risk-free interest ranging between 2.3% and 3.3%, and an option life equal to 54% of the option's
remaining term. Expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of Abbott stock over a period prior to the option's grant equal to the option's expected life. Dividend yield is based on the
option's exercise price and the annual dividend rate at the time of the grant. Risk-free interest is based on the rates available at the time of the grant for zero-coupon U.S.
government issues with a remaining term equal to the option's expected life.
(4)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.

Pension and Retirement Arrangements 

Abbott and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension
benefits are generally based on service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120 months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits. 
The
following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life annuity basis without giving effect to Social
Security offsets and include supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 15. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all
participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts established on behalf of the
officers who participate in that plan. 
During
2004, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: M. D. White, $866,651;
R. A. Gonzalez, $478,944; T. C. Freyman, $294,768; and W. G. Dempsey, $647,018. As of December 31, 2004, the years of service
credited under the Plan for the named officers were as follows: M. D. White - 20;
J. M. Leiden - 4; R. A. Gonzalez - 24; T. C. Freyman - 25; and
W. G. Dempsey - 22. 

Key Employee Retention 

Abbott has change in control arrangements with its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for other key management personnel. The
agreements with the named officers are described below. 
The
agreements with the named officers continue in effect until December 31, 2007, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year thereafter unless Abbott
notifies the officer that the agreement will not be extended. The agreements also automatically extend for two years following any change in control (as defined in the agreements) that occurs while
they are in effect. The agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for specified reasons or if the officer elects to terminate employment under certain circumstances during a
potential change in control (as defined in the agreements) or within two years following a change in control of Abbott (including termination by the officer for any reason during the
thirty-day window period which begins six months after the date of a change in control), the officer is entitled to 

18

 


receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and bonus (assuming for this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the
average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus
assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). The officer
will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including outplacement services and tax and financial counseling for three years and the value of three more years of pension
accruals), payment of any excise taxes and other related taxes and payments for which the officer is responsible as a result of the agreement, and reimbursement of certain legal, tax and audit fees.
The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's stock incentive programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term.
Independent compensation consultants confirm that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market practice. 

Performance Graph 

The following graph compares the change in Abbott's cumulative total shareholder return on its common shares with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Health
Care Index. Abbott's cumulative total shareholder returns have outperformed both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Standard and Poor's 500 Health Care Index over the period shown on the
following graph.

Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accountants (Item 2 on Proxy Card) 
Abbott's
bylaws provide that the audit committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as auditors. In October 2004, the audit committee appointed
Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as auditors for 2005. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2002. 
Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for
2005. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for 2005, the audit
committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent registered
public accountants for 2005.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they
desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees 

The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates ("the Deloitte
Entities") for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, and fees billed for other services rendered by the Deloitte
Entities during these periods.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Auditor 

The audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the Deloitte Entities after
January 1, 2003. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public
accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the
independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific
pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The
audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to
the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.

Report of the Audit Committee 
Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the
consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as
expressing an opinion on (i) management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and (ii) the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the board of directors. In this context, the committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the
2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public accounting firm. 
The
committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61
(Communication with Audit Committees), as amended. 
The
committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1
(Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), as amended, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their
independence. The committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 20 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees" is compatible with
maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shareholder Proposal on Executive Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card) 
Ronald
M. Friedman, 5743 Theobald Road, Morton Grove, Illinois 60053-3047, owner of 303 Abbott common shares, has informed Abbott that he intends to present the following proposal at the
meeting: 
Shareholders
request that the board of directors grant no bonuses, pay raises, stock options, restricted stock or any other additional benefits, other than salary, for the five highest compensated
executive officers in any year in which Abbott or any of its 50% or more owned subsidiaries pay any fines to government agencies in excess of fifteen million dollars. This applies only to compensation
agreements made in the future. 

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
I
believe that Abbott's management and board of directors should conduct our company's business in such a manner so we do not incur government fines. This resolution makes it clear to our management
and directors, that operating in ways to incur government fines is unacceptable to shareholders. The following table lists the consent decrees and other settlements and corresponding bonuses, options
and restricted stock granted to the chief executive officer.

Ross Enteral Nutrition Investigation




Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Executive
Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card) 
As
a health care company, Abbott operates in a complex, dynamic and highly regulated environment. Abbott's management is committed to ensuring that its practices comply with applicable laws and
regulations worldwide and to promoting the highest ethical standards. 
This
commitment to compliance is embodied in the company's management systems and programs. For example, Abbott's Code of Business Conduct provides guidelines to all employees on ethical and legal
issues. Furthermore, Abbott's Office of Ethics and Compliance makes available to employees a number of resources to enhance compliance, including an Ethics and Compliance Helpline, a
toll-free number available to all employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week; division level compliance staff; and extensive in-person as well as Web-based
training programs. 
Management
is charged with resolving legal or compliance issues in the long-term interests of shareholders, patients and employees. In some circumstances, these interests are best served
through settlement of disputes, regardless of fault. Such settlements minimize legal costs and risks of protracted litigation, as well as avoid disruption to the business. 
Linking
executive compensation to a single dimension such as settlement decisions is inappropriate. Abbott's total compensation program is competitive and performance driven, aligning compensation
with the achievement of annual and long-term goals, and the company's values. Compensation decisions are based on multiple dimensions designed to ensure that management is furthering
shareholder interests. Management's incentive compensation reflects these multiple dimensions. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Shareholder Proposal Concerning Performance-Based Options (Item 4 on Proxy Card) 
The
United Brotherhood of Carpenters Pension Fund, 101 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, owner of 25,400 Abbott common shares, has informed Abbott that it intends to present the
following proposal at the meeting: 
Resolved: That the shareholders of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") request that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopt a policy
that a significant portion of future stock option grants to senior executives shall be performance-based. Performance-based options are defined as follows: (1) indexed options, in which the
exercise price is linked to an industry or well-defined peer group index; (2) premium-priced stock options, in which the exercise price is set above the market price on the grant
date; or (3) performance-vesting options, which vest when a performance target is met.  

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
As
long-term shareholders of the Company, we support executive compensation policies and practices that provide challenging performance objectives and serve to motivate executives to
enhance long-term corporate value. We believe that standard fixed-price stock option grants can and often do provide levels of compensation well beyond those merited, by reflecting stock
market value increases, not performance superior to the company's peer group. 
Our
shareholder proposal advocates performance-based stock options in the form of indexed, premium-priced or performance-vesting stock options. With indexed options, the option exercise price moves
with an appropriate peer group index so as to provide compensation value only to the extent that the company's stock price performance is superior to the companies in the peer group utilized.
Premium-priced options entail the setting of an option exercise price above the exercise price used for standard fixed-priced options so as to provide value for stock price performance that exceeds
the premium option price. Performance-vesting options encourage strong corporate performance by conditioning the vesting of granted options on the achievement of demanding stock and/or operational
performance measures. 
Our
shareholder proposal requests that the Company's Compensation Committee utilize one or more varieties of performance-based stock options in constructing the long-term equity portion of
the senior executives' compensation plan. The use of performance-based options, to the extent they represent a significant portion of the total options granted to senior executives, will help place a
strong emphasis on rewarding superior corporate performance and the achievement of demanding performance goals. 
Leading
investors and market observers, such as Warren Buffet and Alan Greenspan, have criticized the use of fixed-price options on the grounds that they all to often reward mediocre or poor
performance. The Conference Board's Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise in 2002 looked at the issue of executive compensation and endorsed the use of performance-based options to help
restore public confidence in the markets and U.S. corporations. 
At
present, the Company does not employ performance-based stock options as defined in this proposal, so shareholders cannot be assured that only superior performance is being rewarded.
Performance-based options can be an important component of a compensation plan designed to focus senior management on accomplishing long-term corporate strategic goals and superior
long-term corporate performance. We urge your support for this important executive compensation reform.  

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal Concerning
Performance-Based Options (Item 4 on Proxy Card)
The
Abbott board of directors supports the concept of performance-based compensation for all employees. In the opinion of the board, the interests of its executive officers are already aligned with
the interests of shareholders through the grant of fixed-priced fair market value stock options. Fixed-priced stock options are inherently performance-based because the exercise price (sometimes
called grant price) equals the market price of Abbott common stock on the date of grant. Employees realize no economic benefit unless Abbott's stock price increases in value subsequent to the grant
date, thereby benefiting all shareholders. 
As
stated in the Compensation Committee Report on pages 13 and 14 of this Proxy Statement, performance-based compensation is an important component of executive compensation and represents a
substantial part of Abbott's compensation program. 

23

 

The
board opposes the specific performance-based options recommended by the proponent because they are not prevalent in the marketplace and may disadvantage the company in attracting and retaining
critical personnel. Further, given the valuation methods utilized, the use of alternative forms of incentive could require the company to grant more shares than it would otherwise award with a
traditional option grant to remain competitive. In addition, variability in accounting charges associated with some performance-based options could create volatility in earnings and performance
comparisons. 
It
is in the best interests of shareholders to preserve the flexibility and discretion of the independent Compensation Committee to design a long-term incentive program that is the most
appropriate for attracting and retaining industry-leading executive talent. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Shareholder Proposal Concerning In Vitro Testing (Item 5 on Proxy Card) 
John
M. Carter (owner of 478 Abbott common shares), The Enid K. Dillon Trust (owner of 3,000 Abbott common shares), and Cornelia Cerf (owner of 300 Abbott common shares), through their attorney, Susan
L. Hall, 2818 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20008, have informed Abbott that they intend to present the following proposal at the meeting. 
WHEREAS,
statistics published by research oversight bodies in North America and Europe document that the vast majority of painful and distressing animal experiments are conducted to satisfy outdated,
government-mandated testing requirements1 and that such testing is on the rise;2 and 
WHEREAS,
nearly 60% of animals used in regulatory testing suffer pain ranging from moderate to severe, all the way to pain near, at, or above the pain tolerance threshold,3 generally
without any pain relief; and 
WHEREAS,
non-animal test methods are generally less expensive,4 more rapid, and always more humane, than animal-based tests; and 
WHEREAS,
unlike animal tests, non-animal methods have been scientifically validated and/or accepted as total replacements for the following five toxicity endpoints: skin corrosion
(irreversible tissue damage), skin irritation (milder and reversible damage), skin absorption (the rate of chemical penetration), phototoxicity (an inflammatory reaction caused by the interaction of a
chemical with sunlight), and pyrogenicity (a fever-like reaction that can occur when certain intravenous drugs interact with the immune system); 
NOW
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the shareholders request that the Board: 

1.Commit
specifically to using only non-animal methods for assessing skin corrosion, irritation, absorption, phototoxicity and pyrogenicity.
2.Confirm
that it is in the Company's best interest to commit to replacing animal-based tests with non-animal methods.
3.Petition
the relevant regulatory agencies requiring safety testing for the Company's products to accept as total replacements for animal-based methods, those approved
non-animal methods described above, along with any others currently used and accepted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other developed countries. 


Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
This
Resolution is designed to harmonize the interests of sound science with the elimination of animal-based test methods where non-animal methodologies exist. It seeks to encourage the
relevant regulatory agencies to join their peers in accepting validated in vitro and other non-animal test methods. It will not compromise
consumer safety or violate applicable statutes and regulations. 
Further,
this Resolution commits the Company to end animal testing for five specific endpoints in favor of valid non-animal methods. These include the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity
Test, human skin equivalent tests for corrosivity, and a human blood-based test for pyrogenicity, all of which have been successfully validated through the European Centre for the Validation of
Alternate Methods.5 Several non-animal methods have also been adopted as Test Guidelines by the OECD6 (an alliance of 30 member countries including the US, EU,
Japan, Canada and Australia). Regulatory agencies in OECD member countries are not at liberty to reject data from non-animal tests for skin corrosion, skin absorption and phototoxicity
where such data have been generated in accordance with an OECD Test Guideline. 
We
urge shareholders to support this Resolution.

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal Concerning  In Vitro Testing (Item 5 on Proxy Card) 
The
company uses in vitro (non-animal) tests, including those mentioned in the proposal, where the methods have been proven as
scientifically valid and approved by regulatory agencies around the world. Abbott's
preference is to use in vitro tests whenever appropriate, if these tests do not compromise patient safety or the effectiveness of our medicines. 
The
requirement of this proposal to replace all animal-based tests with in vitro tests is unfeasible. There are insufficient in
vitro tests approved and available to allow Abbott to discover and test new medicines. It has been scientifically proven that many in
vitro tests do not mimic the true biological state, and therefore, cannot be relied upon to determine safety and efficacy of medicines. To date, in
vitro tests can comprise but a small component of overall testing that is required by regulatory bodies. Abbott is required by national and international regulatory agencies to
use in vivo (animal) testing to meet our commitment to provide patients with safe and effective medicines. 
Abbott
respects the unique role animals have played in advancing medical discovery, without which millions of people would not realize the benefits of the many treatments that improve and save lives.
Abbott's animal welfare and treatment policies and practices reflect industry best standards. Our program and facilities meet regulations of the United States, European Union and other countries,
including the U.S. Animal Welfare Act and the standards established by the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Abbott's program has been accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) since 1975. In past site reviews by AAALAC, our company's
program has been noted to be exemplary. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Shareholder Proposal Concerning Political Contributions (Item 6 on Proxy Card) 
The
Mercy Investment Program, 205 Avenue C, #10E, New York, New York 10009, owner of 150 Abbott common shares, and three other proponents have informed Abbott that they intend to present the following
proposal at the meeting. 
Resolved,
that the shareholders of Abbott Laboratories ("Company") hereby request that the Company provide a report updated semi-annually, disclosing the Company's: 

1.Policies
and procedures for political contributions (both direct and indirect) made with corporate funds.
2.Monetary
and non-monetary contributions to political candidates, political parties, political committees and other political entities organized and operating under 26 USC
Sec. 527 of the Internal Revenue Code including the following:


a.An
accounting of the Company's funds contributed to any of the persons described above;
b.The
business rationale for each of the Company's political contributions; and
c.Identification
of the person or persons in the Company who participated in making the decisions to contribute. 

This
report shall be posted on the company's website to reduce costs to shareholders.  

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
As
long-term shareholders of Abbott Laboratories we support policies that apply transparency and accountability to corporate political giving. In our view, such disclosure is consistent
with public policy in regard to public company disclosure. 
There
are various disclosure requirements for political contributions but they are difficult for shareholders to access and are not complete. Although the Bi-Partisan Campaign Reform Act
enacted in 2002 prohibits corporate contributions to political parties at the federal level, corporate soft money state-level contributions are legal in 49 states and disclosure standards vary widely. 
Corporations
can also make unlimited contributions to "Section 527" organizations, political committees formed for the purpose of influencing elections but not supporting or opposing specific
candidates. These do not have to be reported. 
Between
January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2002 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA)of which the company is a dues-paying
membergave $35.5 million in soft money political contributions. (Follow the Dollar Report, July 1, 2003, Common Cause). 
Company
executives exercise wide discretion over the use of corporate resources for political purposes. They make decisions without a stated business rationale for such donations. In
2001-02, the last fully reported election cycle, Abbott Laboratories contributed at least $335,100 (The Center for Responsive Politics, Soft Money Donors,
http://www.opensecrets.org/softmoney). 
Relying
only on the limited data available from Federal Election Commission and the Internal Revenue Service, the Center for Responsive Politics, a leading campaign finance watchdog organization,
provides an incomplete picture of the Company's political donations. 
Proponents
believe our company should be using its resources to win in the marketplace through superior products and services to its customers not because it has superior access to political leaders.
Political power can change, leaving companies relying on this strategy vulnerable. 
Finally,
the requested report represents a minimal cost to the company, as presumably management already monitors corporate resources used for such purposes. Although lacking a business rationale for
such contributions, our peer company Pfizer discloses these contributions on an annual basis. 
There
is currently no single source of information that provides the information sought by this resolution. That is why we urge your support for this critical governance reform. 

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal Concerning Political
Contributions (Item 6 on Proxy Card) 
The
Abbott board of directors views Abbott's participation in the political process on issues that influence patients' access to affordable and innovative medicines and the company's
long-term success to be appropriate. For example, the company's political involvement has contributed to providing 41 million Medicare seniors with access to discounts on their
medicines; increased funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs that will benefit 87,000 patients; and ensuring Medicare coverage for thousands of patients using 

27

 

end-stage renal care and self-injectable rheumatoid arthritis medicines. 
Information
about the political contributions of Abbott and the Abbott Laboratories Employee Political Action Committee (AEPAC) is publicly available on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) Web site
(www.fec.gov) and state election Web sites. 
Abbott
and its employees participate in the political process with contributions to federal and state political candidates and parties. All AEPAC funds, which represent the primary source of political
contributions to candidates in 2004, come from voluntary, personal contributions of Abbott employees. 
Support
from Abbott and AEPAC for any candidate is bipartisan and based on clear criteria: policy positions that reflect Abbott's interests; representation of geographic areas where Abbott employees
and facilities are located; relevant legislative committee assignments; political track record; ability to be elected; and need for financial assistance. For example, the company has supported
political candidates from both parties who are working to expand access of health care to uninsured patients; who believe in the free market system; who value the importance of medical innovation; and
who support protection of intellectual property. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Shareholder Proposal Concerning HIV/AIDS-TB-Malaria Pandemics (Item 7 on Proxy Card) 
The
Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, 5704 Roland Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21210-1399 and 28 other proponents have informed Abbott that they intend to present the following
proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide the proponents' names and addresses to any shareholder who requests that information and, if provided by a proponent to Abbott, the number of Abbott common
shares held by that proponent. 
Resolved: Shareholders request that our Board review the economic effects of the HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria pandemics on the company's business
strategy, and its initiatives to date, and report to shareholders within six (6) months following the 2005 annual meeting. This report, developed at reasonable costs and omitting proprietary
information, will identify the impacts of these pandemics on the company.  

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
We
believe that HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria pose major risks to the long-term financial health of firms, like Abbott Laboratories that operate in emerging markets. 
The
crisis of HIV/AIDS in Africa, with half of all global HIV/AIDS cases, is well known. UNAIDSthe joint United Nations AIDS programreports life expectancy in much of
southern Africa has declined by over half, to barely thirty years. 
New
research also shows disturbing trends in Asian markets. New infection rates in Asia are at all-time highs. 7.4 million people there are living with HIV. India alone has more
citizens living with HIV than any country, except South Africa. ("Report on the Global AIDS Pandemic," UNAIDS 2004). 
Foreign
Affairs reported in December 2002 that even moderate HIV pandemics in India and China may reduce per capita GNP by 2025 to virtually 2000 levelswiping out a generation's
worth of economic growth. 
In
China, UNAIDS projects 10 million infections by 2010. Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley's Chief Economist, wrote in June 2004 that "all the economic growth in the world cannot possibly
compensate for the devastation China would face if [UNAIDS] projections were to come to pass." 
Standard
Chartered Bank Group Chief Executive Mervyn Davies, in a 2004 World Economic Forum report, cautioned that "AIDS imposes a day-to-day economic 'tax' that compromises
business productivity." Firms pay in increased health and benefit costs, decreased productivity, higher turnover, and other ways. 
Despite
these warnings, the same report concluded "firms are not particularly active in combating HIV/AIDS" and "businesses appear to be making decisions based on a patchy assessment of the risks they
face." 
Unfortunately,
"most companies do not yet report appropriate data for investors to make informed decisions about the impact of HIV/AIDS," says a 2003 survey of corporations by UNAIDS. We believe, to
date, our company's reporting has also been inadequate. 
In
contrast to our company's performance, several large-cap firms make reporting on infectious diseases best practice. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has funded an HIV/AIDS
Resource Document at the Global Reporting Initiative. 
In
2004, Coca-Cola shareholders approved a resolution seeking such a report with 98% support. Coca-Cola's subsequent report notes "the moral and business imperatives are of
equal importance" in responding to HIV/AIDS. 
Our
experience with Coca-Cola and other leading companies demonstrates that these reports need not be onerous. In our opinion, shareholders must fully understand the threats posed by these
diseases in order to make informed assessments of our company's value. 
We
urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution.  

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal Concerning
HIV/AIDSTBMalaria Pandemics (Item 7 on Proxy Card) 
This
proposal is unnecessary because the company already recognizes that HIV/AIDS poses a serious social and health threat globally. Moreover, the health, economic and social impacts of this pandemic
have been documented by many organizations including UNAIDS, WHO, World Bank, think tanks such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, business organizations such as the Global Business
Coalition on HIV/AIDS, and several U.S. government agencies. 
Abbott
is a leader among global health care companies and is already addressing this pandemic on multiple fronts. Our company's efforts include research and development of new HIV medicines and
diagnostic instruments and tests; comprehensive workplace policies; humanitarian initiatives to assist developing countries; 

29

 


and encompass advocacy for U.S. and multilateral funding to address HIV/AIDS in countries hardest hit by this disease. Abbott's efforts have been documented in our Global Citizenship reports and Web
site. 
The
creation of further reviews and another report as required by the proposal are not productive uses of company resources. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Shareholder Proposal on Separating the Roles of Chair and CEO (Item 8 on Proxy Card) 
Catholic
Healthcare West, 185 Berry Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, California 94107-1739, owner of 195,120 Abbott common shares, and 6 other proponents have informed Abbott that they
intend to present the following proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide the proponents' names and addresses to any shareholder who requests that information and, if provided by a proponent to
Abbott, the number of Abbott common shares held by that proponent. 
Resolved: The shareholders of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") request the Board of Directors establish a policy of, whenever possible, separating
the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, so that an independent director who has not served as an executive officer of the Company serves as Chair of the Board of Directors. 
This
proposal shall not apply to the extent that complying would necessarily breach any contractual obligations in effect at the time of the 2005 shareholder meeting.  

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal 
We
believe in the principle of the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This is a basic element of sound corporate governance practice. In addition, the lack of access to
medicines has created a leadership crisis at our company which a separation of the Chair and CEO would begin to address. 
We
believe an independent Board Chairseparated from the CEOis the preferable form of corporate governance. The primary purpose of the Board of Directors is to protect
shareholder's interests by providing
independent oversight of management and the CEO. The Board gives strategic direction and guidance to our Company. 
The
Board will likely accomplish both roles more effectively by separating the roles of Chair and CEO. An independent Chair will enhance investor confidence in our Company and strengthen the integrity
of the Board of Directors. 
A
number of respected institutions recommend such separation. CalPERS Corporate Core Principles and Guidelines state: "the independence of a majority of the Board is not enough" and that "the
leadership of the board must embrace independence, and it must ultimately change the way in which directors interact with management." 
An
independent board structure will also help the board address complex policy issues facing our company, foremost among them the crisis in access to pharmaceutical products. 
Millions
of Americans and others around the world have no access to our company's life-saving medicines. This is an emergency, and our company's charitable work, while laudable, is neither
a sufficient nor strategic response. We believe an independent Chair and vigorous Board will bring greater focus to this ethical imperative, and be better able to forge solutions for shareholders and
patients to address this crisis. 
The
current business model of the pharmaceutical sector is undergoing significant challenges. The industry has generated substantial revenue from American purchasers, who pay higher prices for
medicines than people in other developed countries. Pressure on drug pricing and dependence on this business model may impact our company's long-term value. 
In
order to ensure that our Board can provide the proper strategic direction for our Company with independence and accountability, we urge a vote FOR this resolution.  

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Separating the
Roles of Chair and CEO (Item 8 on Proxy Card) 
In
the opinion of the Abbott board of directors, the company's governance structure ensures that the appropriate level of oversight and independence is applied to all board decisions. The board also
believes it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to retain flexibility to exercise its collective judgment to determine who should serve as chairman, given the circumstances at
any particular point in time. The existing structure, in which the offices of chairman and chief executive officer are held by one individual, supports the board's exercise of its oversight
responsibilities and does not compromise its independence. 
The
company has a strong governance profile. The board is composed of more than a two-thirds majority of independent directors. All of the key committees, including Audit, Compensation,
Nominations and Governance and Public Policy are composed of independent directors. The company also has established governance guidelines, which are posted on its corporate Web site. 

31

 
The
board has a lead director to facilitate communication with the board and preside over regularly conducted executive sessions or sessions where the chairman is not present. The lead director, and
all other directors, communicate regularly with the chairman and CEO regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters. Additionally, the company has a published procedure enabling
shareholders and other third parties to communicate directly with board members. 
The
interests of the company and its shareholders are well-served by the current structure. The governance profile of the company is sufficient to ensure independence and accountability
and a rigid application of this proposal is not in the best interests of the company. It deprives the board of its exercise of business judgment to determine how best to provide oversight to the
company and eliminates the ability to consider all circumstances in determining the appropriate chairman for the board. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal. 

32

 

Other Matters 
In
1999, shareholder derivative actions were filed against Abbott's then current directors and certain former directors relating to Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the United States Food and Drug
Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Division facilities in Lake County, Illinois. In March 2001, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois dismissed these complaints. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In March 2003, the Seventh Circuit reversed the District Court's
dismissal. These derivative actions alleged the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, allowing the alleged regulatory noncompliance and causing Abbott to pay
$100 million to the federal government and withdraw certain medical diagnostic kits from the U.S. market. The plaintiffs requested unspecified monetary damages, including punitive and exemplary
damages, to be paid to Abbott, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various other
forms of relief. On March 1, 2005, the trial court approved a settlement of this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, a charter for the board's public policy committee has been adopted (a
copy of which is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations Web Site, www.abbottinvestor.com), Abbott will fund regulatory / compliance activities in the amount of
$27 million, and the plaintiffs' attorneys fees will be paid from proceeds of insurance maintained by Abbott for its directors. 
In
2001, shareholder derivative suits were filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Abbott's then current directors, with the exception of R. A. Gonzalez (who was not a director at
the time of the alleged activity), alleging that these directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to take action to prevent certain marketing and pricing practices at TAP Pharmaceutical
Products Inc. TAP is a 50 percent owned joint venture of Abbott. The plaintiffs requested a return of salaries, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various other forms of
relief. On February 25, 2005, the court approved a settlement in this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, certain provisions were included in the charter for the board's public policy
committee, and the plaintiffs' attorneys fees will be paid from proceeds of insurance maintained by Abbott for its directors. 
In
2003, three shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against Abbott's then current directors alleging that these directors breached their fiduciary
duties in relation to certain business practices in the enteral nutritional business. The suits sought compensatory damages, return of salaries, attorneys fees and other forms of relief. All three
actions were consolidated and in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. In January 2004, a related additional shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois which was dismissed on July 29, 2004. On February 28, 2005, the Circuit Court of Cook County approved a settlement in this matter. Under the terms of the
settlement, certain provisions were included in the charter for the board's public policy committee, and the plaintiffs' attorneys fees will be paid from proceeds of insurance maintained by Abbott for
its directors. 
As
required by its articles of incorporation, Abbott advanced defense costs on behalf of the present and former directors named in these suits.  

Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2006 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement 
Shareholder
proposals for presentation at the 2006 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 18, 2005 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2006 meeting. 

33

 

Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting 
A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and governance committee or the secretary
of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these
procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on: 

the
record date for that Annual Meeting,
the
date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and
the
date of the Annual Meeting, 
may
directly nominate persons for director by providing proper timely written notice to the secretary of Abbott. 
That
notice must include the name, age, business address, residence address and principal occupation or employment of the nominee, the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominee and any
other information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, the notice must include the name and
record address of the nominating shareholder and the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominating shareholder. 
A
shareholder of record on the record date for an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott and on the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders may
properly bring business before the Annual Meeting by providing timely written notice to the secretary of Abbott. For each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice
must include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such
business, the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the shareholder and any material interest of the shareholder in such business. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's principal executive offices not less
than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within twenty five days
before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual
Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. 

General 
It
is important that proxies be returned promptly. Shareholders are urged, regardless of the number of shares owned, to vote their shares. Most of Abbott's shareholders may vote their shares by
telephone or the Internet. Shareholders who wish to vote by mail should sign and return their proxy card in the enclosed business reply envelope. Shareholders who vote by telephone or the Internet do
not need to return their proxy card. 
The
Annual Meeting will be held at Abbott's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, located at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. Admission to the meeting will be by
admission card only. A shareholder planning to attend the meeting should promptly complete and return the reservation form. Reservation forms must be received before April 15, 2005. An
admission card admits only one person.

   EXHIBIT A 

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE STANDARD 
No
director qualifies as "independent" unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Abbott or its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner,
shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Abbott or any of its subsidiaries). In making this determination, the Board shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances,
including the following standards: 

A
director is not independent if the director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries, or an immediate family member is, or
has been within the last three years, an executive officer of Abbott or its subsidiaries.
A
director is not independent if the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three years,
more than $100,000 in direct compensation from Abbott or its subsidiaries, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such
compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), and other than amounts received by an immediate family member for service as an employee (other than an executive officer).
A
director is not independent if (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is Abbott's internal or external auditor;
(B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firm's audit,
assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a
firm and personally worked on Abbott or its subsidiaries' audit within that time.
A
director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company
where any of the present executive officers of Abbott or its subsidiaries at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee.
A
director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments to, or
received payments from, Abbott or its subsidiaries for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other
company's consolidated gross revenues.
A
director is not independent if the director is an executive officer of a charitable organization that received charitable contributions (other than matching contributions)
from Abbott and its subsidiaries in the preceding fiscal year that are in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable organization's consolidated gross revenues.
