PROXY STATEMENT FOR 1995 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 

This proxy statement is furnished to stockholders by the Board of Directors 
for solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on 
Tuesday, May 9, 1995, at 10 a.m., and at all adjournments thereof, for the 
purposes set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person 
giving it at any time before it is exercised in any of the following ways: 
(1) by a written instruction to the Office of the Secretary reasonably 
indicating the stockholder's desire to revoke an existing proxy; (2) by 
signing and returning to the Company a proxy with a more recent date than 
that of the proxy first given; or (3) by signing and returning a floor ballot 
at the meeting of stockholders. 

The Company will bear the cost of preparing, printing, and mailing material 
in connection with this solicitation of proxies. In addition to the use of 
the mails, solicitations may be made by regular employees of the Company 
personally and by telephone. The Company intends to reimburse brokerage 
firms, banks, and others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, 
including clerical expenses, in forwarding proxy material to beneficial 
owners of stock or otherwise in connection with this solicitation of proxies. 
The Company has retained Georgeson & Co., Inc. to assist in the solicitation 
at a cost of approximately $15,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 

The Company anticipates that the proxy statement and the form of proxy 
enclosed will first be sent to its stockholders on or about March 27, 1995. 

The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a policy that all stockholder 
meeting proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders are to 
be maintained in confidence, and no such document shall be available for 
examination, nor shall the identity and vote of any stockholder be disclosed, 
except as may be necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to allow 
the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. 
The policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes 
shall be independent and shall not be employees of the Company. 

RECORD DATE AND VOTING SECURITIES 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 1995 are 
entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of February 28, 1995, the Company 
had outstanding and entitled to vote 419,700,423 shares of common stock 
without par value. 

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
Shares held for the account of persons participating in the Company's 
dividend reinvestment plan will be voted automatically in accordance with the 
vote indicated by the stockholder of record on the proxy and, if no choice is 
indicated, both record shares and shares held in the Company's dividend 
reinvestment plan will be voted FOR Items 1 and 2 and AGAINST Items 3 and 4. 
If the stockholder does not vote the shares held of record, the individual's 
shares held in the dividend reinvestment account will not be voted. 

ITEM 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 

NUMBER OF NOMINEES AND CLASSIFICATION 
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, and the 
Bylaws of the Company, as amended, provide that the Board of Directors shall 
consist of such number of directors as shall be fixed from time to time by 
resolution of the Board of Directors. At its meeting of February 13, 1995, 
the Board of Directors fixed the number of directors constituting the entire 
Board at 13, effective as of the date of the 1995 Annual Meeting. 

The Restated Certificate of Incorporation divides the Board into three 
classes. Four directors have terms of office that expire at the 1995 Annual 
Meeting, and these four directors are standing for reelection for a 
three-year term as members of the 1998 Class. These directors are Messrs. 
Brennan, DeSimone, Murray, and Smith. Mr. Junkins is standing for election 
for the first time and is standing for election to the 1997 Class, in order 
to more nearly equalize the number of directors in the respective classes. 
The remaining five directors in the 1996 Class are continuing to serve until 
the 1996 Annual Meeting; and the three present directors in the 1997 Class 
are continuing to serve until the 1997 Annual Meeting. 

All nominees for election to the Board of Directors to the 1998 Class at the 
1995 Annual Meeting will be elected for a term of three years and shall serve 
until their terms expire at the 1998 Annual Meeting or until their successors 
are duly elected and have qualified. Mr. Junkins will be elected for a term 
of two years and shall serve until his term expires at the 1997 Annual 
Meeting or until his successor is duly elected and has qualified. 

The persons named as proxies intend to vote the proxies for the election of 
the three nominees to the Board of Directors or, if any of the nominees 
should be unavailable to serve as a director, an event which is not 
anticipated, the persons named as proxies reserve full discretion to vote for 
any other persons who may be nominated. 

INFORMATION AS TO NOMINEES AND INCUMBENT DIRECTORS 
The nominees and incumbent directors, their age, principal occupation or 
position with the Company (shown in italics), experience, the year first 
elected as a director, and common stock beneficially owned on February 28, 
1995 are shown on the following pages. 

"Shares held" include: stock held in joint tenancy, stock owned as tenants in 
common, stock owned or held by spouse or other members of the nominee's 
household, and stock in which the nominee either has or shares voting and/or 
investment power, even though the nominee disclaims any beneficial interest 
in such stock. Options exercisable within 60 days after February 28, 1995 are 
shown separately. 

"Shares held as deferred stock" by nonemployee directors represent the number 
of shares of the Company's common stock, as of December 31, 1994, which the 
directors will receive upon termination of membership on the Board of 
Directors for any reason. These shares result from the voluntary election by 
the nonemployee directors to defer the payment of directors fees otherwise 
payable in cash into such deferred stock. No shares of common stock have as 
yet been issued, and the directors have neither voting nor investment powers 
in these shares of deferred stock. 

As of February 28, 1995, executive officers and directors as a group 
"beneficially owned" 419,880 shares and held options exercisable within 60 
days after that date for 870,654 shares. All officers and directors as a 
group owned beneficially less than five-tenths of one percent (0.5%) of the 
outstanding common stock of the Company. 

None of the nominees or incumbent directors is related to any other nominee 
or to any executive officer of the Company or its subsidiaries by blood, 
marriage, or adoption. Except for current employees of the Company and Mr. 
Jacobson, no nominee or incumbent director has been an employee of the 
Company within the past five years. 

During 1994, the Company retained the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher 
with regard to various legal matters. Mrs. Peters is a partner in this firm.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
This report was prepared at the direction of the Compensation Committee of 
the Board of Directors (the "Committee") which is composed entirely of 
nonemployee directors of the Company. The Committee establishes and 
periodically reviews compensation levels and policies for the Chief Executive 
Officer ("CEO") and other executive officers, and authorizes short and 
long-term compensation in the form of cash or stock. The current members of 
the Committee are Edward A. Brennan, who serves as Chairman, Allen F. 
Jacobson, Rozanne L. Ridgway, and Frank Shrontz. 

In determining the amount and type of executive compensation, the Committee 
seeks to achieve the following objectives: (1) attract, motivate, and retain 
talented, competent, and resourceful executive officers by providing 
competitive compensation; (2) encourage executives to hold significant 
amounts of stock; and (3) require that a substantial portion of executive 
compensation is variable and "at risk" by being tied to quantifiable 
short-term and long-term measures of the Company's performance. Executive 
compensation is based on performance of the Company against a combination of 
financial and non-financial criteria, ranging from achieving earnings and 
sales growth targets to upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate Values 
(which include customer satisfaction through superior quality and value, 
attractive investor return, ethical business conduct, respecting the 
environment, and fostering employee pride in the Company). 

The Committee begins the process of establishing the amount of compensation 
for the CEO and other executive officers by reviewing compensation surveys of 
selected peer companies. The surveys are primarily conducted by independent 
consultants specializing in executive compensation. The peer companies 
included in the compensation surveys are selected by the independent 
consultants. These peer companies consist of large industrial companies which 
are most likely to be competitors for executive talent. Several different 
surveys have been utilized which include groups of thirteen (13) to 
(seventy-five (75)) different companies. The objective of the Committee is to 
use the survey data to establish the amount of total compensation at a 
competitive level. The Committee does not target any specific quartile of the 
survey data for total compensation or any component of total compensation 
(e.g., Base Salary, Profit Sharing, Performance Unit Plan, or Stock Options). 
The Committee's objective of achieving the total compensation at a 
competitive level has resulted in short-term compensation (base salary and 
profit sharing) being slightly below the median and long-term compensation 
(performance unit plan and stock options) being at or slightly above the 
median. The Committee believes that the Company's most direct competitors for 
executive talent are not necessarily all of the companies that would be 
included in a peer group established to compare shareholder returns. Thus, 
the peer group for purposes of the compensation surveys is not the same as 
the peer group index in the Comparison of Five Year Cumulative Total Return 
graph included on page 21 of this Proxy Statement. 

After the Committee has established the amount of total compensation for the CEO
and other executive officers, the Committee next determines what percent of the
total compensation for a particular individual should be allocated to short-term
compensation in the form of base salary and profit sharing, and long-term
compensation in the form of the performance unit plan and stock options. This
determination is subjective but is based on information from the compensation
surveys and the objectives for executive compensation referred to above. It is
the Committee's long-standing policy that variable, at risk compensation, both
short and long-term, should make up a significant portion of executive
compensation. Depending upon the level of the executive, the Committee targets
between forty-five percent (45%) and seventy percent (70%) of executive
compensation to be variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures
of the Company's performance. Because performance-based compensation is such a
significant part of executive compensation, it is the policy of the Committee to
maximize the deductibility of the performance-based compensation (e.g., profit
sharing, performance unit plan, and stock options) paid to the CEO and other
executive officers under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Each of
the components of short- and long-term executive compensation is described in
greater detail below.

BASE SALARY 
The Committee establishes base salaries annually in relation to base salaries 
paid by the selected peer companies from the compensation surveys. Base 
salaries may be adjusted from time to time according to guidelines 
established for all employees to reflect increased salary levels within the 
peer group, increased responsibilities, or individual performance. The 
Committee does not use financial performance factors, such as earnings per 
share, in establishing Base Salary. This is the only component of executive 
compensation that is not variable. 

PROFIT SHARING 
Profit sharing is variable compensation based on the quarterly consolidated 
net income of the Company and is used to focus management attention on 
profits and the effective use of assets. The number of profit sharing units 
granted to the CEO and executive officers is determined by the Committee as 
part of the overall compensation. The number of profit sharing units 
allocated to each of the named executive officers is established by the 
Committee, in the exercise of its collective judgment, to achieve the 
appropriate ratio between short-term performance-based compensation and other 
forms of compensation and to reflect the level of responsibility of the 
respective executive officer. The amount payable with respect to each profit 
sharing unit is determined by dividing the Company's consolidated quarterly 
net income, less a quarterly reserve of two and one-half percent (21/2%) of 
stockholders' equity (or approximately ten percent (10%) on an annual basis), 
by the number of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock. Because of 
the required minimum return on stockholder equity, the amount of compensation 
paid under the profit sharing plan tends to rise and fall relatively more 
sharply than changes in net income. No amount will be payable under the 
profit sharing plan if the Company's quarterly net income is equal to or less 
than the quarterly reserve of two and one-half percent (21/2%) return on 
stockholders' equity. Profit sharing payments are subject to limitations when 
individual amounts exceed specified relationships to Base Salary. For the 
executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, a portion of 
profit sharing is paid in cash and a portion is paid in stock which is held 
by the Company for ten years or until age 65, whichever occurs first. The 
ratio between that portion of profit sharing paid in cash and the portion 
paid in stock to the named executive officers for 1994 is subjective and 
varies from year to year and among executive officers. However, the more 
senior executive officers have generally been paid a larger portion of profit 
sharing in stock than less senior executive officers. (More details about the 
Company's Profit Sharing Plan are available on page 13 of this Proxy 
Statement.) 

PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN 
The Performance Unit Plan is variable compensation based on the Company's 
long-term performance. The number of performance units allocated to each of 
the named executive officers is established by the Committee, in the exercise 
of its collective judgment, to achieve the appropriate ratio between 
long-term performance-based compensation and other forms of compensation. The 
number of performance units granted to the CEO and executive officers is 
determined by the Committee as part of the overall compensation. The amount 
payable with respect to each performance unit granted is determined by and is 
contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria described below over 
the performance period 1994-1996 (each year weighted equally). The 
performance criteria have been selected to focus management attention on the 
quality of future earnings and assets and on global real sales growth. (More 
details about the Company's Performance Unit Plan are available on pages 18 
and 19 of this Proxy Statement.) 

    Performance Criteria: 

(1) "Relative ROCE" - is the percentage determined by dividing the Company's 
average return on capital employed by the average return on capital employed 
of the companies included, at the end of each year of the performance period, 
in the Standard and Poor's Industrial Index ("S&P 400 ROCE"); and 

(2) "Sales Growth" - is the percentage amount by which the Company's real 
sales growth (sales growth adjusted for inflation and currency effects) 
exceeds the weighted average of real growth reflected by the Industrial 
Production Index for seven major industrial countries (the "Big 7 IPI"). 

    Performance Unit Plan Payments: 

The amount payable with respect to each performance unit is $100 if both the 
Relative ROCE and Sales Growth targets are achieved and is payable on January 
1, 2000 in the form (at the discretion of the Committee) of cash, stock or a 
combination of cash and stock. The maximum amount payable with respect to 
each performance unit is $200. No amount will be payable under the 
performance unit plan if either the Company's cumulative ROCE is less than 
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the S&P 400 ROCE or if Sales Growth (as 
defined above) is less than zero percent (0%). 

STOCK OPTIONS 
The Company's Stock Option plan is also variable compensation based on the 
market appreciation of the Company's Common Stock and is designed to increase 
ownership of the Company's stock. The Company makes stock option grants 
annually at one hundred percent (100%) of the market price on the date of 
grant. The options may be exercised after one year and have a ten year life. 
The number of shares under options to be granted to the CEO and executive 
officers is determined by the Committee as part of the overall compensation. 
The awards are designed to keep total compensation competitive with awards 
made by companies in the survey group, and as such require subjective 
judgment as to the value of the award. The number of option shares currently 
held by each executive is not considered in determining awards. Stock options 
encourage executives to become owners of the Company which further aligns 
their interests with the shareholders. Options have no value unless the price 
of the Company's stock increases. 

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
The compensation of Livio D. DeSimone, Chairman of the Board and Chief 
Executive Officer, is determined by the same process and consists of the same 
short- and long-term components as for the other executive officers listed in 
the Summary Compensation Table, namely base salary, profit sharing, 
performance unit plan, and stock options. The only difference is that a 
higher portion of Mr. DeSimone's total compensation is variable and at risk 
by being tied to quantifiable measures of the Company's performance. These 
measures are quarterly net income, Relative ROCE and Sales Growth, as those 
terms are defined above, and appreciation in the value of 3M stock. In 
addition, the compensation paid to Mr. DeSimone is also based on performance 
against non-financial measures, such as upholding the Company's Statement of 
Corporate Values (which include customer satisfaction through superior 
quality and value, attractive investor return, ethical business conduct, 
respecting the environment and fostering employee pride in their company), 
management succession planning, and the general overall perception of the 
Company by financial and business leaders. In order to keep Mr. DeSimone's 
total compensation competitive, the Committee increased his base salary in 
1992 and again in 1994, which is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table 
on page 12 of this Proxy Statement as higher base salaries for both 1993 and 
1994. Because of increased earnings in 1994, Mr. DeSimone's profit sharing 
cash and profit sharing stock was greater in 1994 than in 1993. The Committee 
awarded Mr. DeSimone the same number of performance units (7,700) and stock 
options (45,400) as it awarded him in 1993.

(1) The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table do not include 
amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes under the Company's pension 
plan. The plan is a defined benefit plan. The amounts shown in the Table do, 
however, include those amounts voluntarily deferred by the named individuals 
under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation 
Plan allows management personnel to defer portions of current base salary, 
profit sharing, and performance unit compensation otherwise payable during 
the year. 

(2) The amounts shown under the headings "Profit Sharing Cash (Bonus)" and 
"Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock Awards)" are payments received under 
the Profit Sharing Plan. The terms "(Bonus)" and "(Restricted Stock Awards)" 
are included to satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission ("SEC"). These payments are based upon the Company's performance 
and are variable in accordance with a predetermined formula. The Compensation 
Committee does not view these payments as bonus payments or restricted stock 
awards as these terms are most often used. The Committee views bonus plans as 
plans which provide for annual (as opposed to quarterly) payments from a pool 
rather than based on a strict formula related to earnings per share, and 
restricted stock awards are generally outright grants of stock as opposed to 
payment in the form of stock held in the custody of the company (restricted 
period) in lieu of cash under a formula based profit sharing plan. 

Generally, profit sharing is paid in cash; however, senior executive 
management, as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive a portion of 
their profit sharing in shares of the Company's common stock (see footnote 3 
on this page). 

The Company's profit sharing plan provides for quarterly payments based upon 
net income after deducting an allowance for a predetermined 10% annual rate 
of return on stockholder equity and is determined by multiplying the number 
of profit sharing units awarded to an individual by this quarterly net income 
after deduction divided by the number of the outstanding shares of the 
Company's Common Stock. 

Because of the required minimum return on stockholder equity, profit sharing 
tends to rise and fall relatively more sharply than changes in net income. 

The number of profit sharing units awarded to the individuals named is 
determined by the Compensation Committee and is intended to reflect the level 
of responsibility of the respective individual. Profit sharing payments are 
subject to limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships 
to base salary. Approximately 4,200 management employees currently 
participate in profit sharing, including the five individuals in the summary 
compensation table. 

(3) The amount shown under the heading "Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted 
Stock Awards)" represents the portion of profit sharing issued as common 
stock to the named individuals, valued at 100% of the fair market value at 
the end of the quarterly profit sharing performance period. The number of 
shares is determined by the Company's quarterly net income performance. 
However, payment is deferred and conditional upon continued employment by the 
Company. Therefore, pursuant to SEC rules, it is included under the headings 
of "Long Term Compensation." 

The shares are held in the custody of the Company for a period of ten years 
or until age 65, whichever occurs first. Any termination of employment, prior 
to that time, without the consent of the Compensation Committee or the Board 
of Directors, other than upon death or permanent disability, will result in 
forfeiture of the Profit Sharing Stock. The recipient is entitled to receive 
dividends and vote these shares in the same manner as any other holder of the 
Company's common stock during the period of custody by the Company. 

From the time of issuance throughout the Restricted Period, Profit Sharing 
Stock rises or falls in value in direct relationship to the Company's common 
stock market performance. Consequently, Profit Sharing Stock reflects both 
short-term and long-term performance elements. 

The named individuals have accumulated, in several cases over seven years, 
the following shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's profit 
sharing plan as of December 31, 1994, valued for these purposes at the fair 
market value of such stock on December 31, 1994, and also on the respective 
dates when the shares were issued into the custody of the Company:

G. Agostini          2,612        139,416         134,348 



(4) "Other Annual Compensation" includes the following, to the extent that 
the aggregate thereof exceeds $50,000: personal benefits received by the 
named individuals, amounts reimbursed the individuals during the year for 
payment of taxes, and that portion of interest above market rates (as 
determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission) earned on that 
compensation voluntarily deferred by the individuals. The personal benefits 
included in these numbers represent the amount of personal financial planning 
services, an amount paid on behalf of the individual for the term portion of 
insurance under the Company's Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan, and 
personal air travel on corporate aircraft imputed to the individual as income 
for tax purposes. In the case of Mr. DeSimone, nearly all of the "Other 
Annual Compensation" received in 1992 and 1994 was a result of income imputed 
to him for travel. 

(5) The number of stock options shown in this column includes both annual 
grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and Progressive Stock 
Options, which are described more fully in footnote 1 on page 16. 

(6) "LTIP Payouts" reflects the value of the total grant for each individual 
under the Company's Performance Unit Plan after the three year performance 
period (e.g., for 1994, the performance period is 1992-1994), but no amount 
will be paid to these individuals under the grant for an additional three 
years pursuant to the terms of the grant. The numbers shown represent 
estimates based upon information available as of February 28, 1995. During 
this additional three year period, interest will be paid at a rate determined 
by the Company's ROCE performance. More specific information about the 
Performance Unit Plan is set forth on pages 18 and 19. 

(7) "All Other Compensation" includes: (a) that amount of Performance Unit 
Plan earnings allocated during the year to the base amounts determined after 
the three-year performance periods of each respective grant, to the extent 
that such earnings are in excess of market interest rates (as determined by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission); and (b) that amount deemed to be 
compensation to the individuals under the Company's Senior Executive Split 
Dollar Plan in accordance with rules developed by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. The Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan provides insurance to all 
of the Company's executive officers under split dollar life insurance, which 
is part term insurance and part whole life insurance with a cash value. Under 
this Plan, the Company is reimbursed for the premium costs of the non-term 
portion of coverage and a possible return when the arrangement terminates 
either by insurance proceeds incident to the death of the individual or by 
cash value after 15 years of participation in the Plan. During 1994, amounts 
deemed compensation under the Plan to the named executive officers in the 
Summary Compensation Table were $11,854 for Mr. DeSimone; $13,368 for Mr. 
Hammerly; $19,853 for Dr. Mitsch; $20,891 for Mr. Eaton; and $14,832 for Mr. 
Agostini. These amounts were determined by treating the non-term portion of 
the coverage as an interest-free loan.

(1)  The Company does not grant any stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). The 
options shown for each individual include both annual grants of Incentive 
Stock Options and nonqualified stock options and grants of Progressive Stock 
Options ("PSO"). Nonqualified options are subject to a reload feature when 
exercised with the payment of the option price in the form of previously 
owned shares of the Company's common stock. Such an exercise results in 
further grants of PSOs. The first grant shown for each individual is the 
annual grant. The remaining lines are PSOs. The PSO grants for each 
individual were made on a single date, but are, pursuant to SEC rules, shown 
in multiple lines because of different expiration dates. 

PSO grants were made to participants who exercised nonqualified stock options
and who made payment of the purchase price using shares of previously owned
Company common stock. The PSO grant is for the number of shares equal to the
shares utilized in payment of the purchase price and tax withholding, if any.
The option price for the PSO is equal to 100% of the market value of the
Company's common stock on the date of the exercise of the primary option or,
alternatively, on the date of the PSO grant to the five named individuals in the
Table, all of whom are subject to the requirements of Section 162(m). The option
period is equal to the remaining period of the options exercised.

Company common stock used for payment must have been owned by the participant
for at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified options per
participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO grants by the Committee.

The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of nonqualified stock options,
without foregoing the opportunity for further appreciation, and promotes
retention of the Company stock acquired.

In any event, a participant receiving an annual grant of nonqualified stock
options can never acquire more shares of Company common stock through successive
exercises of the initial and subsequent PSO grants than the number of shares
covered by the initial annual grant from the Committee.

(2) All options granted during the period were granted at the market value on 
the date of grant if initial grants, or at the fair market values discussed 
in footnote 1 above in the case of Progressive Stock Options, as calculated 
from the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York Stock 
Exchange Composite Index. The option price shown for the "All Optionees" line 
is $50.20 since the vast majority of options granted during 1994 carried that 
price. 

(3) The expiration date for the "All Optionees" line is shown as May 10, 
2004, since that is the applicable date for the vast majority of options 
granted during 1994. 

(4) Pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
Company has elected to provide a grant date present value for these option 
grants determined by a modified Black-Scholes or binomial option pricing 
model. Among key assumptions utilized in this pricing model were: (i) that 
the time of exercise of Incentive Stock Options would be four years, and of 
PSOs would be two years, into the term of the option, which could be for 
terms as long as ten years, in recognition of the historical exercise 
patterns at the Company for these types of options; (ii) expected volatility 
of 17.3%; (iii) risk-free rate of return of 3.5% for two years, and 5% for 
four years; and (iv) dividend growth rate of 8.6%. No adjustments for 
non-transferability or risk of forfeiture have been made. The Company voices 
no opinion that the present value will, in fact, be realized and expressly 
disclaims any representation to that effect.

(1) The "Value Realized" or the unrealized "Value of Unexercised In-the-Money
Options at FY-End " represents the aggregate difference between the market value
on the date of exercise or at December 31, 1994, in the case of the unrealized
values, and the applicable exercise prices. These differences accumulate over
what may be, in many cases, several years. These stock options all have option
periods of ten years when first granted, and Progressive Stock Options have
option periods equal to the remaining option period of the initial nonqualified
options resulting in Progressive Stock Options.

(1) The Company's Performance Unit Plan provides long-term compensation to 
approximately 150 key management personnel based upon the Company's 
attainment of long-term performance and growth criteria. 

It is administered by the Compensation Committee, none of the members of 
which are current employees of the Company. The Committee has sole discretion 
in the selection of participants, performance criteria, size of awards, 
performance period, and the timing and form of payment, as well as all other 
conditions regarding awards. 

To date, the Committee has established the performance goals based on 
criteria of return on capital employed and sales growth. More detail about 
current performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report 
on page 8. Performance units awarded to date have been assigned a face value 
of $100 each. However, the actual amount of the payments is based upon the 
Company's attainment of the performance goals. If the targets established by 
the Committee are attained during the performance periods, the performance 
unit will have a value of $100 at the end of the performance period. If the 
target is not attained, the value will be less than $100 and, if exceeded, 
will be more than $100. The ultimate value of the performance unit can vary 
from no value to $200, depending upon actual performance. 

Payment is contingent upon continued employment to the payment date or 
earlier retirement under the Company's pension plan. Participants receiving 
awards during 1994, including the five executive officers in the Summary 
Compensation Table, will receive payment in 2000, provided that such 
individuals continue employment with the Company until such payment date 
(except in the event of death, retirement, or disability). Payment under the 
Plan may be made in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or any 
combination of cash and stock, at the discretion of the Compensation 
Committee. In the past, payment has only been made in cash. 

(2) The awards granted during 1994 will be determined by the Company's 
attainment of return on capital employed and sales growth criteria during a 
three-year performance period of 1994, 1995, and 1996. More detail about 
current performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report 
on pages 8 and 9. However, there will be an additional three-year involuntary 
holding period thereafter during which the base amounts determined during the 
performance period will earn interest and remain subject to forfeiture if the 
participant discontinues employment for any reason other than death, 
disability, or retirement. 

(3) The estimated future payouts do not include any interest factor which 
would be earned annually during the three-year involuntary holding period 
following the performance period. Interest during the involuntary holding 
period would accrue annually at a rate equal to 50% of the return on capital 
employed of the Company during the three years and would be payable, together 
with the base award, in 2000. 

PENSION PLAN TABLE 

The following table sets forth the estimated annual benefits payable to the 
Company's executive officers upon retirement in specified remuneration and

(1) Earnings include base salary, profit sharing cash, and the value of 
Profit Sharing Stock (at the time of award) actually earned by the 
participant and does not include any other forms of remuneration. The 
benefits are computed on the basis of straight-life annuity amounts, and are 
not subject to any deduction for social security or other offset amounts. 

(2) To provide for the retirement security of its employees, the Company has 
defined benefit pension plans for U.S. employees. These plans are fully paid 
by the Company, and employees become vested after five years of service. 
Under the plans, a participant may retire with an unreduced pension at age 
60, and if the participant's age and service total at least 90, he or she 
would receive a social security bridge to age 62. 

The five individuals listed in the Summary Compensation Table are presently 
entitled to the respective years of service credit set opposite their names: 



 
L.D. DeSimone      38 
H.A. Hammerly      40 
R.A. Mitsch        35 
L.E. Eaton         35 
G. Agostini        29 


DIRECTORS' FEES 
Directors who are not employed by the Company receive an annual fee of 
$38,000, of which $13,000 is paid only in common stock of the Company, if, at 
the time of payment, the nonemployee director owned less than 13,000 shares 
of the Company's common stock. Committee chairmen, not employed by the 
Company, receive an additional fee of $5,500 per year. Nonemployee directors 
are paid $1,800 for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and 
$1,200 for attendance at meetings of Committees of the Board. No directors' 
fees are paid to directors who were also employees of the Company. During the 
last full fiscal year, there were five meetings of the Board of Directors, 
and all nonemployee directors had four scheduled meetings of Committees of 
the Board. 

All incumbent Directors and nominees for reelection attended 75 percent or 
more of Board and Committee meetings. The average attendance was in excess of 
90 percent of all Board and Committee meetings. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Company's 1992 Directors Stock Ownership 
Program, nonemployee directors may elect to defer payment of all or a portion 
of the foregoing fees payable in cash through a deferred cash or common stock 
equivalents account. This permits nonemployee directors to build identity of 
interest with stockholders generally through the deferred stock which is 
equivalent to the Company's common stock, except that shares of deferred 
stock may neither be voted or disposed. In addition, nonemployee directors, 
who serve more than one year as such, are paid retirement income equal to the 
annual retainer in effect at the time of their retirement for a period equal 
to their length of service on the Board as a nonemployee director. 

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
The members of the Committee are Messrs. Brennan, Chairman, Jacobson, 
Shrontz, and Ambassador Ridgway. 

Mr. Jacobson retired on November 1, 1991, as Chairman of the Board and Chief 
Executive Officer of the Company. The Securities and Exchange Commission 
requires that Mr. Jacobson's participation on the Committee be characterized 
as "insider participation" based upon his former employment with 3M. The 
Board of Directors believes that Mr. Jacobson's participation in the 
deliberations of the Committee provides continuity and specific knowledge 
about individual performances and, further, that no conflicts of interest 
exist. Mr. Jacobson did not participate in any grant or award decisions of 
the Committee during the one-year period following his retirement or with 
regard to any matter that might affect him personally. 

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH 

The graph below compares the Company's cumulative total shareholder return, 
overall stock market performance with reinvested dividends, during the five 
fiscal years preceding December 31, 1994, against the Standard & Poor's 500 
Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both of which are 
well-known and published industry indices. The Company is included in both 
the S&P 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial group of 30 companies. 
The Company, as a highly diversified manufacturer and seller of a broad line 
of products, is not easily categorized with other more specific industry 
indices.

TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT 

During 1994, seven executive officers and directors had loans outstanding 
with the Eastern Heights State Bank of Saint Paul, a subsidiary of the 
Company. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business on 
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as 
those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons 
of comparable circumstances and did not involve more than normal risk of 
collectibility or present other unfavorable features. 

AUDIT, COMPENSATION, AND BOARD ORGANIZATION COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Audit, Compensation, and Board Organization Committees are standing 
Committees of the Board. 

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Murray (Chairman), Mr. Junkins, Mrs. 
Peters, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Sullivan. The Committee met four times during 
1994. Its primary functions are to recommend independent certified public 
accountants; review the scope of the audit examination, including fees and 
staffing; review the independence of the auditors; review and approve 
nonaudit services provided by the auditors; review findings and 
recommendations of auditors and management's response; review the internal 
audit and control function; and review compliance with the Company's ethical 
business practices policy. 

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Brennan (Chairman), 
Jacobson, and Shrontz, and Ambassador Ridgway. The Committee met four times 
during 1994. Its primary functions are to review management compensation 
programs, approve compensation changes for senior executive officers, review 
compensation changes for senior management, and administer management stock 
option plans (acting without any person who may be a participant under any 
such plans). 

BOARD ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE 
Members of the Board Organization Committee are Messrs. DeSimone (Chairman), 
Jacobson, Junkins, Murray, Smith, and Ambassador Ridgway. The Committee met 
four times during 1994. The Committee acts to select and recommend candidates 
to the Board of Directors to be submitted for election at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board of Directors has adopted criteria with respect to its membership 
and the Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders or 
others in light of these criteria. A stockholder may submit the name of a 
proposed nominee by writing to the Office of the Secretary, Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing Company, 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota 55144. The 
Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors 
concerning the composition and size of the Board and its committees, 
frequency of meetings, directors' fees, and similar subjects; reviews and 
makes recommendations concerning retirement and tenure policy for Board 
membership; recommends proxies for meetings at which directors are elected; 
and audits programs for senior management succession. 

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require disclosure of 
late Section 16 filings by 3M directors and executive officers. To the best 
of the Company's knowledge and belief, there were no late filings during 
1994. 

ITEM 2. INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

The Audit Committee recommended and the Board of Directors appointed the firm 
of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., independent certified public accountants, to 
audit the books and accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year 
1995. In accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, this appointment is being 
presented to the stockholders for ratification. If the stockholders do not 
ratify the selection of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., the selection will be 
reconsidered by the Board of Directors. 

Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. has audited the Company's books since 1975. The firm 
has offices and affiliates in most localities throughout the world where the 
Company has operations. Audit services provided by the firm in 1994 included: 
audit of consolidated financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries; limited reviews of interim reports; reviews of filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission; consultations on matters related to 
accounting and financial reporting; assisting the Audit Committee in the 
review of compliance with the Company's ethical business practices policy; 
audits of statutory financial statements for certain foreign subsidiaries; 
and audits of the financial statements of the Company's benefit plans. 

Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. also provided a number of nonaudit services during 
1994, all of which were approved or reviewed by the Audit Committee. The 
aggregate fees for these nonaudit services constituted approximately 17 
percent of the fees for audit services performed by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. 

A representative of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. is expected to be present at the 
stockholders meeting and available to respond to appropriate questions and 
will be given an opportunity to make a statement, if the representative 
chooses to do so. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE 
APPOINTMENT OF COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P., INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTANTS, TO AUDIT THE BOOKS AND ACCOUNTS FOR 1995. PROXIES SOLICITED BY 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR RATIFICATION UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE 
IS SPECIFIED. 

ITEM 3. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 

The following stockholder proposal was submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Richard A. Dee, 115 East 89th Street, 
New York, New York 10128, holder of record of 100 shares of the Company's 
common stock. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all shares of 
common stock of the Company entitled to vote and cast with respect thereto 
shall be required for the adoption of this proposal regarding the election of 
the Company's directors. 

PROPOSAL AND SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
"Stockholders of publicly-owned companies do not 'elect' directors. Directors 
are selected by incumbent directors and managements - stockholders merely 
'ratify' or approve those selections much as they ratify selections of 
auditors. 

"The term 'Election of Directors' is misused in proxy materials to refer to 
the process by which directors are empowered. The term is inappropriate - and 
misleading. With no choice of candidates, there is no election. 

"Approval of this Corporate Governance proposal will provide 3M stockholders 
a choice of director candidates - and an opportunity to elect those whose 
qualifications and stated intentions they favor. Its approval will provide 
stockholders with properly or 'duly' elected representatives. 

"In 1979 and 1980, I sponsored at 3M the first Corporate Governance proposals 
submitted by a stockholder to a publicly-owned company. The proposals called 
for 3M to reconstitute its board of directors with a majority of independent 
"outside directors". The board was management-dominated and, based on my 
experiences, its few outside directors were ineffective window dressing. 

"3M campaigned actively against the proposals. On average, under 5% of shares 
were voted for an outside director majority. Institutional investors 
controlled over 54% of 3M shares; almost all voted against the proposals - as 
the Company requested. In spite of its vehement opposition to the proposals, 
not long after their defeat 3M quietly reconstituted its board - with an 
outside director majority! 

"Outside director board majorities now are standard at virtually all major 
publicly-owned companies, institutional investors have become well-publicized 
sponsors of many Corporate Governance proposals - and such fiduciaries rarely 
invest in publicly-owned companies that lack outside director majorities. 

"Providing stockholders a choice of directors and a true election is an idea 
whose time has come - as it came for outside director majorities. 
Understandably, incumbent directors are anxious to protect their absolute 
power over corporate activities. Control of corporate governance through 
control of board composition assures that power. 

"Public office-holders are duly (and democratically) elected - and are held 
accountable. Continuing in office requires satisfying constituents, not 
simply nominators. Corporate directors take office unopposed and answer only 
to fellow directors. 

"It is impossible, realistically, for stockholders to utilize successfully 
their purported right to nominate and to elect directors; no practical means 
will exist for them to cause director turnover - until this or a similar 
proposal is approved. 

"It is hereby proposed that the Board of Directors, at its next regular 
meeting, adopt a resolution requiring the Board Organization Committee to 
nominate two candidates for each directorship to be filled by voting of 
stockholders at annual meetings. In addition to customary personal 
backgrounds, Proxy Statements shall include a statement by each candidate as 
to why he or she believes they should be elected. 

"Although Delaware law enables incumbents to select all nominees, approval of 
this proposal will permit stockholders to replace any or all directors if 
they become dissatisfied with them or the results of corporate policies 
and/or performance. Not a happy prospect even for those able to nominate 
their possible successors. 

"Please vote FOR this proposal." 


COMPANY'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL 
Your Company is an economic enterprise. As such, a primary objective of its 
Board of Directors is to ensure that the Company provides an attractive 
economic return to its stockholders, while fulfilling its responsibilities to 
customers, employees, competitors, the environment, and the communities in 
which it operates. Attracting and retaining the most highly qualified 
candidates, in view of the composite backgrounds of the total membership of 
the Board of Directors, is critical to achieving its business objectives. 


The Board Organization Committee carefully reviews and brings forward to the 
full membership of the Board candidates who can best fit the current and 
future needs of the Company. The Board of Directors then recommends nominees 
for election by you, the Company's stockholders. 

The Board of Directors does not believe that the process by which "public 
office-holders" are elected is a better method to select nominees. The Board 
of Directors does not believe it can best discharge its responsibilities to 
you, its stockholders, by proposing alternate candidates for each 
directorship. 

Further, it is possible that many of the most qualified candidates would not 
consent to stand for election to the Company's Board under the condition of 
this political process. 

This proposal is not in the best interest of the Company or your interests as 
stockholders. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL 
RELATING TO THE NOMINATION PROCESS FOR DIRECTORS. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE 
IS SPECIFIED. 

ITEM 4. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REINCORPORATION IN MINNESOTA 

The following stockholder proposal was submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Aaron Belk, Trustee of the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Affiliates Pension Fund, 25 Louisiana 
Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, which Fund is the beneficial owner of 
12,600 shares of the Company's common stock. The affirmative vote of holders 
of a majority of all shares of common stock of the Company entitled to vote 
and cast with respect thereto shall be required for the adoption of this 
proposal regarding reincorporation of the Company in the State of Minnesota. 

PROPOSAL 
RESOLVED: That shareholders urge the Board of Directors of Minnesota Mining 
and Manufacturing Co. take the steps necessary to reincorporate our Company 
from Delaware to Minnesota. 

SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
While Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing was founded in Two Harbors, Minn., 
is headquartered in Minnesota, and remains one of the leading corporate 
citizens of Minnesota, the state that oversees our company's corporate rules 
is Delaware. 

For 3M, Delaware offers corporate governance law friendly to management. In 
1986, for example, the state removed the financial penalty for directors who 
violate the fiduciary duty of care (if shareholders approve). 

For Delaware, such management-friendly rules attract incorporations. And 
incorporations mean fees -- enough fees so that Delaware has no sales tax and 
relatively low property taxes. Delaware lawmakers make no secret of this 
scheme and the motives behind it. 

In fact, 54 of the 100 largest American companies are incorporated in 
Delaware, and only one of these -- DuPont -- is headquartered here. 

But what serves management and Delaware, however, doesn't necessarily serve 
shareholders. As another example, Delaware law tolerates any supermajority 
vote requirements. Some companies have locked up simple governance rules such 
as a classified board with an 80% supermajority vote requirement to amend it 
- -- disenfranchising 79% of the shareholders who might seek reform. 

Most problematic is the "race to the bottom" among the states. For example, 
following Delaware's action to limit director liability led first to a flood 
of reincorporation proposals. Then, 26 other states subsequently adopted 
similar laws "in an attempt to keep their in-state companies from moving to 
Delaware," explained IRRC. 

Reincorporating the 3M to Minnesota won't immediately solve all corporate 
governance deficiencies because the "race to the bottom" has already taken 
its toll. Still, state lawmakers have become increasingly restless with this 
"race." A recent report from the National Conference of State Legislatures 
calls on lawmakers to pay close attention to matters of corporate governance. 
With diligence, these lawmakers can make good on this resolve. It's then up 
to shareholders to bring corporations back from Delaware. 

By reincorporating the 3M in Minnesota, shareholders can bring our company 
back home and help end the race to the bottom. 

COMPANY'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL 
The Company's operations began in 1902 as a Minnesota corporation. In 1929, 
the Company was reincorporated in Delaware for reasons unrelated to the 
issues raised in this proposal. A separate court system devoted to corporate 
and business matters remains unique to the State of Delaware. That court 
system and a large body of law result in a high degree of predictability in 
legal matters affecting business corporations. 

Of the top 100 industrial corporations in the United States, more than 60 
percent are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Another 15 percent are 
incorporated in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction of their principal 
business location. Less than 25 percent are actually incorporated in the 
jurisdiction of their principal business location, as suggested should be the 
case for the Company in this proposal. 

The Board of Directors does not believe that any particular effect on the 
governance of the Company would result solely as a result of reincorporation 
in Minnesota. 

The act of reincorporation through liquidation and dissolution or merger 
would necessitate extensive efforts and expenses that would run in the 
millions of dollars, for no particular advantage. The transfer of properties 
and assets, the assignment of all contracts, the cancellation and reissuance 
of all outstanding shares of the Company, and similar tasks incidental to 
such reincorporation would clearly distract attention from primary business 
objectives of the Company. As an example, all outstanding common stock of the 
Company in the possession of or controlled by its stockholders would 
necessarily be surrendered in return for new certificates of a new 
corporation. 

This proposal is not in the best interest of the Company or your interests as 
stockholders. 

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL 
RELATING TO REINCORPORATION IN THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. PROXIES SOLICITED BY 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL UNLESS A CONTRARY 
VOTE IS SPECIFIED. 

OTHER MATTERS 

The Management knows of no other matters which may properly be presented at 
the Annual Meeting, but if other matters do properly come before the meeting, 
it is intended that the persons named in the proxy will vote according to 
their best judgment. 

Stockholders are encouraged to date, sign, and return the enclosed proxy in 
the enclosed envelope, to which no postage need be affixed if mailed in the 
United States. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may revoke your proxy at 
that time and vote in person if you desire; otherwise, your proxy will be 
voted for you. If you plan to attend the meeting in person, please mark the 
appropriate box on the enclosed proxy card. An attendance card will then be 
mailed to you. This will be helpful in making proper arrangements for the 
meeting. 

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 1996 ANNUAL MEETING 

Any proposal submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and 
form of proxy for the 1996 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received at 
the Company's principalexecutive offices in St. Paul, Minnesota, on or before 
December 1, 1995. 

By Order of the Board of Directors.

Vice President and Secretary 

TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN 
AND THE 3M EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN 

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trusts established in
connection with the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") and the 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan (the "VIP"). As Trustee, it is the record owner of the
shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company ("3M") held
in the ESOP and the Company Contribution Accounts of the VIP for the benefit of
participants. Since the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership
Plan ("PAYSOP") applicable to union-free employees was merged into the ESOP
during 1990, the shares of 3M common stock held in the PAYSOP Trust have now
been transferred to the ESOP Trust.

The ESOP and the VIP each permit participants to instruct the respective
Trustees how to vote the number of shares of 3M common stock allocated to the
participants' respective accounts. The number of shares of 3M common stock held
in your individual accounts in the ESOP and the VIP are indicated at the top of
the enclosed voting instruction card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
9, 1995, and Proxy Statement, (2) a card for giving voting instructions, and (3)
a return envelope. If you complete the card and return it in the enclosed return
envelope to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for the
Trustee, by May 2, 1995, the Trustee will vote, in accordance with your
instructions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your respective
accounts.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the ESOP and VIP accounts. The ability to instruct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

The enclosed instruction card must be properly completed if voting instructions
are to be honored. If the card is not received by May 2, 1995, or if the voting
instructions are invalid, the shares held in your ESOP Trust Account will be
voted by State Street Bank and Trust Company in the same proportion that the
other participants in the ESOP direct the Trustee to vote the shares held in
their ESOP accounts, and the shares held in your VIP account shall be voted by
State Street Bank and Trust Company as directed by the Public Issues Committee
of the 3M Board of Directors.

Please complete, date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed voting 
instruction card.


TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M SAVINGS PLAN 

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trust established in
connection with the 3M Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"). As Trustee, it is the
record owner of the shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company ("3M") held in the Savings Plan for the benefit of participants. Since
the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP")
applicable to employees eligible to participate in the Savings Plan was merged
into the Savings Plan during 1993, the shares of 3M common stock held in the
PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the Savings Plan.

The Savings Plan permits participants to instruct the Trustee how to vote the
number of shares of 3M common stock allocated to the participants' respective
accounts. The number of shares of 3M common stock held in your individual
account in the Savings Plan are indicated at the top of the enclosed voting
instruction card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
9, 1995, and Proxy Statement, (2) a card for giving voting instructions, and (3)
a return envelope. If you complete the card and return it in the enclosed return
envelope to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for the
Trustee, by May 2, 1995, the Trustee will vote, in accordance with your
instructions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your account.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the Savings Plan accounts. The ability to instruct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

The enclosed instruction card must be properly completed if voting instructions
are to be honored. If the card is not received by May 2, 1995, or if the voting
instructions are invalid, the shares held in your Savings Plan account shall be
voted by State Street Bank and Trust Company, as directed by the Public Issues
Committee of the 3M Board of Directors.

Please complete, date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed voting instruction
card.
