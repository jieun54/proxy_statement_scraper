ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 23,
1999, at Abbott's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of
Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the
accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about March 9,
1999. Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders
and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail or in
person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries.
Abbott has retained Georgeson & Company Inc. to aid in the solicitation of
proxies, at an estimated cost of $14,000 plus reimbursement for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE
 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 24, 1999, will be
entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 1999,
Abbott had 1,517,068,371 outstanding common shares, which are the only
outstanding voting securities.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING OF PROXIES
 
A shareholder may vote in person or through the valid appointment of a proxy.
The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than three persons
as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies may be revoked at any time
prior to the meeting. This may be done by written notice delivered to the
secretary of Abbott, or by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date.
Most of Abbott's shareholders may vote their shares by telephone, using the
internet, or by mail. If you vote by telephone or using the internet, you do not
need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting by telephone or
using the internet can be found with your proxy card.
 
All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected. If you wish to
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the
Annual Meeting.
 
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive
to elect the 13 nominees hereinafter named. These shares may be voted
cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than
the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee become unavailable to
serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of
directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy
holders, such action is necessary or desirable.
 
Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of
the appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, or the approval of either or
both of the shareholder proposals, or where the shareholder has abstained on
these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as specified.
Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification of
Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors and AGAINST both shareholder proposals.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of
the shareholders with respect to that matter. Abstentions and withheld votes
have the effect of votes against a matter.
 
A proxy may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such
proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur,
for example, when a broker or bank is not permitted to vote stock held in street
name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present
and, therefore, not entitled to vote on such matter, although these shares may
be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares
will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be
decided at the meeting.
 
It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that
reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be
disclosed, except: (i) where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
(ii) where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend
claims, (iii) where a shareholder provides comments with his or her proxy, (iv)
where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, (v) to allow the inspectors
of election to certify the results of a vote, or (vi) in limited circumstances,
such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended
by the board of directors.
 
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and
voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott
employees.
 
The board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be
brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of
the proxy holders.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY OWNERSHIP
 
On January 31, 1999, the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust, c/o Abbott
Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-6400, held
106,719,327 of Abbott's common shares (approximately 7.0 percent of the
outstanding common shares). These shares were held for the individual accounts
of approximately 36,399 employees and other plan participants who participate in
the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan. The Stock Retirement Trust is
administered by both a trustee and three co-trustees. The trustee of the Trust
is Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are G. P. Coughlan, T. C.
Freyman, and T. M. Wascoe, officers of Abbott. The voting power with respect to
the shares owned by the Trust is held by and shared among the co-trustees. The
co-trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions from the participants,
if the co-trustees determine that a matter to be voted on at a shareholder
meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The individual
participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by the terms
of the Trust. The Trust Agreement is of unlimited duration. The co-trustees are
also fiduciaries for certain other employee benefit trusts maintained by Abbott
and have shared voting and/or investment power with respect to the 2,995,750
common shares (approximately .2 percent of the outstanding shares of Abbott)
held by those trusts.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
 
The board of directors, which held eight meetings in 1998, has four committees
established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee,
compensation committee, and nominations and board affairs committee.
 
The executive committee, whose members are D. L. Burnham, chairman, H. L.
Fuller, W. D. Smithburg, J. R. Walter, and W. L. Weiss, did not hold any
meetings in 1998. This committee may exercise all the authority of the board in
the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board
action.
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               2

The audit committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chairman, K. F. Austen,
D. A. Jones, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr., and J. R. Walter, held two meetings
in 1998. This committee provides advice and assistance regarding accounting,
auditing, and financial reporting practices of Abbott. Each year, it recommends
to the board a firm of independent public accountants to serve as auditors. The
audit committee reviews with such auditors the scope and results of their audit,
fees for services, and independence in servicing Abbott. The committee also
meets with Abbott's internal auditors to evaluate the effectiveness of the work
they perform.
 
The compensation committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, B. Powell
Jr., A. B. Rand, W. D. Smithburg, and W. L. Weiss, held three meetings in 1998.
This committee is responsible for setting and administering the policies and
programs that govern both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.
 
The nominations and board affairs committee, whose members are D. A. Jones,
chairman, K. F. Austen, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, W. A. Reynolds and R. S.
Roberts, held three meetings in 1998. This committee develops general criteria
regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers,
recommends candidates for such positions to the board of directors, and advises
the board of directors with respect to the conduct of board activities,
including assisting the board in the evaluation of the board's own performance.
A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director or
directly nominate persons for director by complying with the procedures on page
19.
 
The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 1998
was 96 percent.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
INFORMATION CONCERNING NOMINEES FOR DIRECTORS (ITEM 1 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Thirteen directors are to be elected to hold office until the next Annual
Meeting or until their successors are elected. All of the nominees, except J. M.
Leiden, are currently serving as directors. P. N. Clark and T. R. Hodgson have
retired. K. F. Austen and D. L. Burnham will retire as directors following the
Annual Meeting and are not standing for reelection.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
Report of the Compensation Committee
 
The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.
 
The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:
 
    - Integrates compensation programs which link total shareholder return with
      both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and
      measurement processes.
 
    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.
 
    - Helps attract and retain key executives who are critical to the long-term
      success of the corporation.
 
The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.
 
The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies are included in the Standard and Poor's Healthcare
Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and
performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison.
 
Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements -- base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation -- is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.
 
In 1998, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.
 
Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively
taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining
the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases.
 
The Abbott Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and Performance Incentive Plan (PIP)
are designed to reward executives when the corporation achieves certain
financial objectives and when each executive's area of responsibility meets its
predetermined goals. These goals include financial elements such as consolidated
net earnings, profitability, total sales, and earnings per share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Each year, individual incentive
targets are established for MIP participants based on competitive survey data
from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, targets are set to
deliver total compensation between the mid and upper range of competitive
practice as warranted by corporate performance. For 1998, 40% of the Management
Incentive Plan target award was earned for achievement of the corporation's
earning per share goal. The remainder of the targeted incentive was earned based
on the committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the
predetermined goals discussed above. Each year, individual base award
allocations are established for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated
net earnings. For 1998, each PIP

participant's final award allocation was based on the committee's overall
assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals
discussed above.
 
To motivate and reward its executives and managers and to directly align key
employee and shareholder interests, the corporation has provided forms of equity
participation for many years. Grants of stock options, replacement stock
options, and restricted stock awards are important parts of this relationship.
To ensure this objective is achieved, executives follow fixed stock ownership
guidelines.
 
Targeted award ranges for stock options and restricted stock opportunities are
determined taking into account competitive practice among the comparison
companies noted above. Equity participation targets are set based on established
salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the target ranges are
established such that equity participation opportunities will be in the mid-
to-upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by corporation
and individual performance.
 
Actual individual awards are determined based on the established competitive
target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance.
The committee considers the amounts of options and restricted stock previously
granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional
options and restricted stock.
 
In 1998, the committee granted Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 4.0% which was consistent with the
corporation's established merit increase program. As reflected in the
corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 1998 included 5.0%
growth in sales, and 12.5% growth in earnings per share. In light of this
performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the committee
determined to grant Mr. Burnham a bonus, stock options and restricted stock. In
recognition of successful completion of management succession ahead of schedule,
Abbott will pay Mr. Burnham $2,205,000 in 1999, and he will act as a consultant
during this year.
 
It is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for
executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and
its stockholders in achieving the corporation's long-term business objectives.
To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and take
action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

    resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of Abbott's
    common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number of shares used
    to make that payment. The replacement option has an exercise price equal to
    the market value of Abbott's common stock on the date the replacement option
    is granted and a term expiring on the expiration date of the original
    option.

(2) Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted
    in tandem with these options. These rights are exercisable only for 60 days
    following a change in control of Abbott. Upon exercise, the optionee must
    surrender the related option and will receive a payment, in cash, in an
    amount equal to the difference between the option's price and the fair
    market value of the shares subject to the option.
 
(3) One-third of the shares covered by these options are
    exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three
    years.
 
(4) The dollar amounts under these columns are the
    result of calculations at the 5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and,
    therefore, are not intended to forecast possible future appreciation, if
    any, of the stock price.
 
(5) Amounts were determined using total shares
    outstanding at December 31, 1998 of 1,516,063,494 and a December 31, 1998
    closing market price of $49.00 per share.

Pension and Retirement Arrangements
 
Abbott and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan known as
the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees in the
United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on service
and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120 months
of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits are
partially offset for Social Security benefits.
 
The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis without giving effect to Social Security offsets and include
supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. The compensation considered
in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation
shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on
page 11 and, for D. L. Burnham and T. R. Hodgson, the restricted stock awards
vesting during the year and on January 4, 1999: $5,313,750 for D. L. Burnham and
$489,300 for T. R. Hodgson. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan
are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established
on behalf of all participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the
nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000
are funded through individual trusts established on behalf of the officers who
participate in that plan. In addition, Abbott has agreed to make an additional
payment into D. L. Burnham's trust during 1999 to fund an additional monthly
pension benefit of $6,238.08. During 1998 (and 1999 for D. L. Burnham), the
following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such
individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: D. L. Burnham,
$8,028,711; M. D. White, $155,204; T. R. Hodgson, $895,476; R. L. Parkinson Jr.,
$179,864; G. P. Coughlan, $133,201; and J. A. Amundson, $94,886. As of December
31, 1998, the years of service credited under the Plan for the named officers
were as follows: D. L. Burnham, - 16; M. D. White, - 14; T. R. Hodgson, - 26; R.
L. Parkinson Jr., - 22; G. P. Coughlan, - 8; and J. A. Amundson, - 15. In 1998,
Abbott and D. L. Burnham established the consulting arrangement described in the
Compensation Committee Report on page 10.

Compensation of Directors
 
Abbott employees are not compensated for serving on the board or board
committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each month of
service as director and $667 for each month of service as a chairman of a board
committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee). Effective with the 1999 Annual Meeting, non-employee directors will
be compensated $5,000 for each month of service as director.
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              14

Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form
of non-qualified stock options, or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of
Abbott or paid into a grantor trust established by the director) until payments
commence (generally at age 65 or upon retirement from the board of directors).
If the fees are deferred, the director may elect to have the fees credited to a
stock equivalent account under which the fees accrue the same return they would
have earned if invested in Abbott common shares. Interest is accrued annually on
deferred fees not credited to a stock equivalent account.
 
If a non-employee director elects to receive any or all of his or her directors'
fees in the form of non-qualified stock options, the fees covered by that
election are converted into stock options based upon an independent appraisal of
the value of the options. These options are granted annually, on the date of the
annual shareholder meeting. The options have a purchase price equal to the fair
market value of the shares covered by the option on the grant date. An option
may be exercised during the ten year period following its grant and provides for
the automatic grant of a replacement stock option if all or any portion of its
exercise price is paid by delivery of Abbott common shares. The replacement
stock option covers the number of shares surrendered to pay that exercise price,
has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date
the replacement stock option is granted, and expires on the expiration date of
the original stock option.
 
Under the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee
director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder
meeting receives a restricted stock award with a fair market value on the date
of the award closest to, but not exceeding, $47,000 for 1998 and $52,000 for
1999. In 1998, this was 650 shares (before giving effect to a two-for-one stock
split effective in May 1998). The non-employee directors are entitled to vote
these shares and receive all dividends paid on the shares. The shares are
nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a
change in control of Abbott.
 
In 1998, K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services for Abbott
pursuant to a consulting agreement in the areas of research and development, new
technology, and immunopharmacology. The consulting agreement, which expires on
March 31, 1999, provides that the fees he earns under the agreement may be
deferred in the same manner as fees earned under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. In 1998, Dr. Austen received $50,000 for his
consulting services.

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Abbott's bylaws provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit committee,
the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent public
accountants to serve as auditors and that such appointment shall be submitted
for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board has
appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This firm
has served as Abbott's auditors since 1963. The board of directors recommends a
vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen LLP as independent
public accountants for 1999.
 
Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE CERES PRINCIPLES (ITEM 3 ON PROXY
CARD)
 
WHEREAS: All leaders of industry in the United States now acknowledge their
obligation to pursue superior environmental performance and to disclose
information about that performance to their investors and other stakeholders.
 
The integrity, utility, and comparability of environmental disclosure depends on
the creation of environmental reports that employ a common format, use credible
metrics, and follow a set of a generally accepted environmental disclosure
standards.
 
The Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES), a ten year old
partnership among some of the largest investors, environmental groups, and
corporations in the country, has established what we believe is the most
thorough and well-respected environmental disclosure form in the United States.
 
CERES has also gathered leading international organizations, including the
United Nations Environment Programme, into a collaborative Global Reporting
Initiative to guide and accelerate the worldwide trend toward standardized
environmental reporting.
 
The CERES Principles and the CERES Report have already been adopted by leading
firms in highly diverse industries such as Bank America, Baxter International,
Bethlehem Steel, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Interface, ITT Industries,
Pennsylvania Power and Light, Polaroid, and Sun Company.
 
We believe endorsing the CERES Principles commits a company to the prudent
oversight of its financial and physical resources through: 1) protection of the
biosphere; 2) sustainable use of natural resources; 3) waste reduction; 4)
energy conservation; 5) risk reduction; 6) safe products/services; 7)
environmental restoration; 8) informing the public; 9) management commitment;
10) audits and reports. (The full text of the CERES Principles and accompanying
CERES Report form are obtainable from CERES, 11 Arlington Street, Boston
Massachusetts 02116, (617) 247-0700 or at www.ceres.org).
 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that the company endorse the CERES Principles as
a reasonable and beneficial component of their corporate commitment to be
publicly accountable for environmental performance.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
PROPONENT'S STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE ENDORSEMENT OF
THE CERES PRINCIPLES
 
Recent studies show that the integration of environmental commitment into
business operations provide competitive advantage and improve long-term
financial performance for companies. In addition, the depth of a firm's
environmental commitment and the quality with which it manages its environmental
performance provide us with indicators of the foresight of its management.
 
Given investors' needs for credible information about a firm's environmental
performance, and given the large number of companies that have already endorsed
the CERES Principles and adopted its report format,
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17

endorsement of the CERES Principles is a reasonable, widely accepted step for
any company wishing to demonstrate its seriousness about superior environmental
performance.
 
The goal of the CERES Principles is continuous improvement in corporate
environmental performance, coupled with public accountability. One cannot
measure improvement without having data over time. Standardizing that data
enables investors to assess environmental progress within and across industries.
By endorsing the CERES Principles, a company agrees to a single consistent
standard for environmental reporting. An endorsing company works with CERES and
other endorsing companies in setting that reporting standard.
 
Your vote FOR this resolution serves the best interests of our Company and its
shareholders.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE CERES
PRINCIPLES (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Your board of directors opposes the shareholder proposal and recommends that you
vote AGAINST the proposal.
 
Abbott is committed to operating its businesses in an environmentally
responsible manner. Abbott considers environmental responsibility a priority
that helps protect our planet for future generations. Abbott's environmental
commitment also supports its business objectives and enhances the corporation's
long-term financial growth. To this end, Abbott's written environmental policy
commits the corporation to accountability for its environmental performance. The
policy requires that all Abbott employees and operations throughout the world
comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The policy describes
the corporation's commitment to implement environmental management practices and
programs which help to protect human health and the environment, including
continuing efforts to reduce or eliminate waste and the release of pollutants
into the environment, to conserve resources, to reuse and recycle materials
where feasible at every stage of the product life cycle, and to reduce,
eliminate or change the use of materials or practices as appropriate which may
adversely affect human health and the environment. The policy also promotes
environmental training and education of employees. The corporation's compliance
with its environmental policy substantially implements the objectives of the
CERES Principles.
 
Abbott has developed this policy because it represents a sound use of the
corporation's resources and is part of the corporation's commitment to being a
responsible member of the communities in which we operate. The corporation is
committed to continuous improvement in this area.
 
The corporation files hundreds of environmental reports with federal, state, and
local government agencies. In addition, Abbott prepares its own report which
focuses on environmental performance and is available both in print and on the
company's web site (www.abbott.com). Imposing another layer of standards and
reports that would be required as a CERES signatory is duplicative and will
unnecessarily increase costs.
 
For these reasons, the board of directors recommends you to vote AGAINST the
proposal.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE PHASE-OUT PRODUCTION OF PVC MEDICAL PRODUCTS
(ITEM 4 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Whereas: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic, the primary component in 25 percent
of all medical products including IV and blood bags, dialysis tubing, surgical
gloves and sterile packaging, creates dioxin during PVC production process;
 
PVC also produces dioxin when burned in a medical or solid waste incinerator;
 
Dioxin is a known human carcinogen and has been linked to a host of other human
health effects, including endocrine (hormone system) disruption, reproductive
abnormalities, altered glucose tolerance, testicular atrophy, neurological
problems, infertility, and other effects in both animals and humans;
 
The EPA has determined that the U.S. population already has dioxin levels in
their bodies at or near the levels which have caused adverse effects in
laboratory animals;
 
Large quantities of chemicals called "phthalates" are used to manufacture
flexible PVC medical products; as a result, a significant percentage of any
flexible PVC product may be comprised of diethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP), a
plasticizer that is a probable human carcinogen, reproductive toxicant and
possible hormone disrupter. DEHP is also toxic to the heart and the kidneys;
 
DEHP has been found to leach out of medical devices and into the fluids they are
carrying, thus putting at risk for DEHP exposure vulnerable populations, such as
premature infants, dialysis patients, and people with AIDS;
 
The leaching of DEHP into patients has been linked to adverse health impacts in
premature infants;
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              18

All patients deserve to receive medical treatment using products and technology
which present the least risk to their health;
 
Abbott Laboratories shareholders voted not to endorse the CERES Principles, but
affirmed that the company's "current environmental policy reflects a strong
commitment to environmental responsibility";
 
Abbott has "committed more than $1.3 billion to research and development,
resulting in new products and new indications for existing products";
 
Therefore, be it resolved that the shareholders request the Board of Directors
of Abbott Laboratories to adopt a policy of phasing out the production of PVC-
containing or phthalate-containing medical supplies.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
PROPONENT'S STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON THE PHASE-OUT
PRODUCTION OF PVC MEDICAL PRODUCTS
 
Establishing as a priority the development and marketing of blood bags and
tubing made from resins that do not contain phthalate plasticizers would provide
safer patient care in the applications which currently expose patients to the
greatest health risks.
 
As a primary supplier of PVC medical devices used in health care, Abbott
Laboratories' marketing of any non-PVC products already developed would be
demonstration of a commitment to risk-reduction and safe products. Utilizing
packaging materials which do not contain phthalates, where such alternatives are
available, would be another demonstration of this commitment.
 
Allocation of sufficient funding for the research and development on non-PVC
alternative polymers, for which non-vinyl options do not currently exist, and
the commercial production of non-PVC medical products would be an important
contribution to the health and safety of all peoples.
 
Please vote your proxy for these concerns.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL "PHASE-OUT
PRODUCTION OF PVC MEDICAL PRODUCTS"
(ITEM 4 ON PROXY CARD)
 
Your board of directors opposes the shareholder proposal and recommends that you
vote AGAINST the proposal.
 
As a supplier of health care products and services and a company whose mission
is to improve lives, Abbott is committed to the safety of its products and to
environmental stewardship. To assure safe products, Abbott stays abreast of
developments regarding materials used in its products and relies on scientific
data generated by government agencies and other credible sources to determine
the safety of these materials.
 
PVC has been used safely in a variety of medical products for more than 25 years
and during that time it has been widely studied. Numerous scientific studies by
organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Office of Science and
Technology of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health demonstrate that
PVC- and DEHP-containing medical products are safe. Abbott uses PVC for medical
products because it is compatible with the medications used with it; its
flexibility, clarity and sterilizability make it easy to use in a health care
setting; and it is cost effective.
 
For these reasons, the board of directors recommends you vote AGAINST the
proposal.
