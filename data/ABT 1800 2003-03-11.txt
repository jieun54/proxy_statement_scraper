babies. She has since gained weight at a healthy, normal level. "It gives me peace of mind knowing that NeoSure® takes care of my daughter's nutritional needs," said Eunice's mother.

Abbott Laboratories  
 Proxy Statement  
Solicitation of Proxies  

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 25, 2003, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 11, 2003. 

 
 
Information about the Annual Meeting     
Who Can Vote 

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2003 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2003, Abbott had 1,563,417,573
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
Cumulative Voting 

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy 

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most
of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting by
telephone or the Internet can be found with your proxy card. 
Revoking a Proxy 

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 

by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott, by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 

1

 
Discretionary Voting Authority 

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 13 nominees named in
Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer
votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors, or the approval of the shareholder proposal, or where the
shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification
of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
The
board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted
in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy 

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on that matter, although these shares may be considered present and
entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies
which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
Inspectors of Election 

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
Cost of Soliciting Proxies 

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $17,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. 
Confidential Voting 

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 




 
where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,




 

where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims,




 

where a shareholder provides comments with a proxy,




 

where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure,




 

to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or




 

in other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors.

Committees of the Board of Directors     
The
board of directors, which held eight meetings in 2002, has five committees established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and board
affairs committee, and public policy committee. Each of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and board affairs committee and public policy committee meets the New
York Stock Exchange listing standards for independence. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, H. L. Fuller, D. A. Jones, W. A. Reynolds, and W. D. Smithburg, did not hold any meetings in 2002.
This committee may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chair, R. S. Austin, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr., and J. R. Walter, held seven meetings in
2002. This committee provides advice and assistance regarding accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices of Abbott. Each year, it appoints a firm of independent public accountants to
serve as Abbott's auditors. The audit committee reviews with such auditors the scope and results of their audit, fees for services, and independence in servicing Abbott. The committee also meets with
Abbott's internal auditors to evaluate the effectiveness of the work they perform. The committee is governed by a written charter, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy
statement. Each of the members of the audit committee is independent and financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. A copy of the report of the audit
committee is on page 18. 
The
compensation committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, J. M. Greenberg, B. Powell Jr., A. B. Rand, and W. D. Smithburg, held three meetings in 2002.
This committee is responsible for setting and administering the policies and
programs that govern both annual compensation and stock ownership programs. A copy of the report of the compensation committee is on pages 11 and 12. 
The
nominations and board affairs committee, whose members are D. A. Jones, chairman, J. M. Greenberg, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, and R. S. Roberts, held
three meetings in 2002. This committee develops general criteria regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, recommends candidates for such positions to the board of
directors, advises the board of directors with respect to the conduct of board activities, and assists the board in the evaluation of the board's own performance and the performance of the chairman of
the board and chief executive officer. A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by complying with the procedures on page 20. 
The
public policy committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, D. A. Jones, W. A. Reynolds, R. S. Roberts, and J. R. Walter, held three meetings in 2002.
This committee has an advisory role with respect to public policy, regulatory, and governmental affairs issues that affect Abbott. 
The
average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 2002 was 96 percent. 

 
 
Compensation of Directors     
Abbott
employees are not compensated for serving on the board or board committees. Abbott's non-employee directors are compensated for their service under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan and the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program. 
Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $6,667 for each month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as a
chairman of a board committee. Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their
fair market value), or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott or paid into a grantor trust established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon
retirement from the board of directors). The director may elect to have deferred fees credited to either a guaranteed interest account at the prime rate plus 2.25 percent or to a stock
equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock
equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the value of Abbott common stock. Abbott pays the director for any tax owed on the income earned by the
trust or any supplemental contribution to the trust by Abbott. 
Under
the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder meeting earns a restricted stock
award with a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding $65,000. In 2002, this was 1,206 shares. The non-employee directors are entitled to vote these
shares and receive all dividends paid on the shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of Abbott.

Executive Compensation     
Report of the Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is composed entirely of directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is responsible for setting and administering the
policies and programs that govern annual compensation, long-term incentives and stock ownership programs. 
The
foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values and management initiatives. The program: 


Integrates
compensation programs which link total shareholder return with both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and
measurement processes.
Supports
a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual performance that is related to both goals and performance of the corporation as compared to
that of industry performance levels.
Helps
attract and retain key executives who are critical to the long-term success of the corporation. 

The
key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive award, and long-term incentive awards comprised of equity participation. These components are administered
with the goal of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace, recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance,
offers the opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and corporate performance and links management's interest in the corporation with the interest of all shareholders. 
The
marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology emphasis. These companies are included in the
Standard and Poor's Health Care-500. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison. 
Using
compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total compensation and each of its elementsbase, incentive and long-term equity-based
compensationis established. The intent is to deliver competitive total compensation that varies appropriately based on the corporation's relative performance. To achieve this objective, a
substantial portion of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year the committee
reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall objectives discussed above. 
In
2002, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual performance and on the extent to which the business plans for the corporation and their areas of responsibility were achieved or
exceeded. Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the job, experience and potential for
advancement as well as by the performance of the corporation. Annual bonuses for 2002 were adjusted to reflect company performance. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools, including the development and execution of
strategic plans, the development of management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively taken
into account by management and the compensation committee in determining the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases. 
The
Abbott Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) and Management Incentive Plan (MIP) are designed to reward executives when the corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's
area of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial elements such as consolidated net earnings, profitability, total sales and earnings per share, and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and the successful development of human resources, including Abbott's diversity initiative. Each year, individual
base award allocations are established for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2002, each PIP participant's final award allocation was based on the committee's overall
assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
Each
year, individual incentive targets are established for MIP participants based on competitive survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, awards are paid at levels
commensurate with performance of the company relative to peer group companies. Under the MIP, 40% of a participant's target 

11

 


incentive award is attributable to corporate performance. Only one-half (20%) of this target was awarded to participants for 2002 as the corporation did not meet its predetermined
financial goals. The remainder of the incentive award is based on the committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
To
motivate and reward its executives and managers and to directly align key employee and shareholder interests, the corporation has provided long-term incentives in the form of equity
participation for many years. Grants of stock options, replacement stock options and restricted stock awards are important parts of this relationship. To ensure this objective is achieved, executives
follow fixed stock ownership guidelines. 
Targeted
award ranges for stock options and restricted stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation
targets are set based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the target ranges are established such that equity awards are appropriately scaled to the performance of
the company within its peer group. 
Actual
individual awards are determined based on the established competitive target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance. The committee considers the amounts of
options and restricted stock previously granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional options and restricted stock. 
As
described above and in light of the company's 2001 performance, in February, 2002 the committee granted Mr. White, the corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a base salary
increase of 3.5%, a stock option grant and an award of restricted stock. 
As
reflected in the corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 2002 included an 8.6% growth in sales, and a 9.6% growth in diluted earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring charges.
This performance did not meet the corporation's predetermined financial goals and bonus payments for the corporate officers were adjusted accordingly. 
As
part of the corporation's compensation plan for 2003, Mr. White and the other corporate officers did not receive merit salary increases. 
It
is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders in achieving the
corporation's long-term business objectives. To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation
strategy and takes action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

(1)The
number and value of restricted shares held as of December 31, 2002, respectively, were as follows:
M. D. White - 260,000 / $10,400,000;
J. M. Leiden - 220,000 / $8,800,000;
R. A. Gonzalez - 193,000 / $7,720,000;

T. C. Freyman - 35,000 / $1,400,000.
The officers receive all dividends paid on these shares.
(2)As
required by the SEC, the value of these restricted stock awards is calculated by multiplying the closing market price ($57.34) on the date of their grant (February 15, 2002)
by the number of restricted shares awarded.
(3)These
amounts are employer contributions made to the Stock Retirement Plan and made or accrued with respect to the 401(k) Supplemental Plan.
(4)These
options are replacement stock options. They are described in the table captioned "Options Granted in Last Fiscal Year" on page 14.
(5)In
July 2000, J. M. Leiden was elected Abbott's chief scientific officer and in August was elected its executive vice president, pharmaceuticals. During the first six months of 2000,
he served as a non-employee director of Abbott and

(1)These
amounts assume hypothetical appreciation rates of 5% and 10% over the term of the option, as required by the SEC, and are not intended to forecast the appreciation of the stock
price. No gain to the named officers will occur unless the price of Abbott's common shares exceeds the options' exercise price.
(2)These
options contain a replacement feature. When the option's exercise price is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise price or the
withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of Abbott's common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number of shares used to make that payment. The
replacement option has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Abbott's common stock on the date the replacement option is granted, is exercisable in full six months after the date of
grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option.
(3)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.
(4)Amounts
were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 2002 of 1,563,068,102 and a December 31, 2002 closing market price of $40.00 per share.

Pension and Retirement Arrangements 

Abbott and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension
benefits are generally based on service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120 months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits. 
The
following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life annuity basis without giving effect to Social
Security offsets and include supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 13. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all
participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts established on behalf of the
officers who participate in that plan. During 2002, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers:
M. D. White, $906,076; R. A. Gonzalez, $266,761; W. G. Dempsey, $1,583,986; and T. C. Freyman, $71,677. As of December 31, 2002, the years of service credited under
the Plan for the named officers were as follows: M. D. White - 18; J. M. Leiden - 2; R. A. Gonzalez - 22; W. G. Dempsey - 20; and T. C. Freyman - 23. 

Key Employee Retention 

Abbott has change in control arrangements with its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for other key management personnel. The
agreements with the named officers are described below.

agreements with the named officers continue in effect until December 31, 2005, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year thereafter unless Abbott
notifies the officer that the agreement will not be extended. The agreements also automatically extend for two years following any change in control that occurs while they are in effect. The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for specified reasons or if the officer elects to terminate employment under certain circumstances during a potential change in control
or within two years following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and bonus (assuming for this purpose
that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro
rata bonus for any current bonus period (both based on the highest of the
actual bonus earned, the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, or the average bonus for the past three years). The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee
benefits (including the value of three more years of pension accruals), payment of a portion of any excise taxes and other related taxes and payments for which the officer is responsible as a result
of the agreement, and reimbursement of certain legal, tax and audit fees. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's stock incentive programs can be terminated and generally
permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. Independent compensation consultants confirm that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current
market practice. 

15 

 
Under
the agreements, a "change in control" occurs on the earliest of the following dates: 

The
date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) becomes the beneficial owner
of, or obtains voting control over, 20% or more of the outstanding common shares of Abbott.
The
date on which Abbott (A) merges or consolidates with or into another corporation, or merges another corporation into Abbott, in which Abbott is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of Abbott are converted into cash, securities of another corporation, or other property, other than a merger or
consolidation of Abbott in which holders of common shares immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation or its parent corporation
immediately after the merger as immediately before, or (B) sells or otherwise disposes of substantially all of Abbott's assets.
The
date on which there has been a change in a majority of the board of directors of Abbott within a 12-month period unless the nomination for
election by Abbott's shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote of two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were in office at the beginning of the
12-month period. 
A
potential change in control occurs if Abbott enters into an agreement that would result in a change in control, Abbott or anyone else publicly announces an intent to take or consider actions which
would constitute a change in control, any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of Abbott's common shares, or Abbott's board adopts a resolution that a potential change in
control exists. 
Abbott's
stock incentive programs provide that, as of the date of a change in control, all outstanding stock options and limited stock appreciation rights become fully exercisable and the terms and
conditions of any outstanding restricted stock awards are deemed satisfied. The stock incentive programs use a definition of change in control that is generally similar to the definition used in the
agreements, except that a change in control is triggered when an entity or person becomes the beneficial owner of, or obtains voting control over, 30% or more of the outstanding common shares of
Abbott.

Ratification of Independent Public Accountants (Item 2 on Proxy Card)     
Abbott's
bylaws provide that the audit committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent public accountants to serve as auditors. In October 2002, the audit committee appointed
Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as auditors for 2003. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2002. 
Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for
2003. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for 2003, the audit
committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent public accountants for 2003.  
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.
They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees 

For 2002, Deloitte & Touche LLP and its affiliates billed or will bill Abbott an aggregate of $4.6 million for professional services rendered for the audit of Abbott's 2002
financial statements and the review of Abbott's financial statements included in Abbott's quarterly reports on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q for
the quarters ended June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002. In addition, Abbott's former auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP and its affiliates, billed Abbott an aggregate of
eighty-seven thousand dollars for professional services rendered for the review of Abbott's financial statements included in Abbott's quarterly report on Securities and
Exchange Commission Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2002. 
Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees 

For 2002, neither Deloitte & Touche LLP nor any of its affiliates rendered any professional services for Abbott in connection with Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation. 
All Other Fees 

For 2002, Deloitte & Touche LLP and its affiliates billed Abbott an aggregate of $1.9 million for all other non-audit services performed for Abbott. Of this
amount, $1.1 million related to international tax support. 

 
 
Change of Independent Public Accountants in 2002     
On
March 15, 2002, Abbott's board of directors adopted the recommendation of its audit committee that Arthur Andersen LLP be dismissed as Abbott's auditors upon the later of: (i) the
engagement of a new independent public accounting firm or (ii) the filing of Abbott's quarterly report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q for the period ending
March 31, 2002. On May 2, 2002, Abbott filed its quarterly report on Securities and Exchange
Commission Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2002 and dismissed Andersen as Abbott's auditors. Andersen's reports on Abbott's consolidated financial statements for
each of the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were the reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001 and through May 2, 2002 there were no disagreements with Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter in
connection with its report on Abbott's consolidated financial statements for such years; and there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K.

Report of the Audit Committee     
Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an audit of Abbott's financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for expressing an opinion on those financial statements based on their audit. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the
board of directors. In this context, the committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's
management and its independent auditors. 
The
committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit
Committees), as amended. 
The
committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1
(Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), as amended, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence. The committee
has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 17 under the captions "Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees" is
compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent auditors. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance     
Due
to an administrative error, one report for Miles D. White reporting a charitable gift of Abbott stock was filed late.  

 
 
Shareholder Proposal     
An
individual shareholder who owns approximately 240 shares of Abbott common stock has informed Abbott that he plans to introduce the following proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide his name
and address to any shareholder requesting such information. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.  

  
 
 Shareholder Proposal on Executive Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card)     
Shareholders
request that the board of directors grant no bonuses, pay raises, stock options, restricted stock or any other additional benefits, other than salary, for the five highest compensated
executive officers in any year in which
Abbott or any of its 50% or more owned subsidiaries pay any fines to government agencies in excess of fifteen million dollars. This applies only to compensation agreements made in the future. 

 
 
Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     
I
believe that Abbott's management and board of directors should conduct our company's business in such a manner so we do not incur government fines. This resolution makes it clear to our management
and directors, that operating in ways to incur government fines is unacceptable to shareholders. The following table lists the fine, or other charges and corresponding bonuses, options and restricted
stock granted to the highest compensated executive.

The compensation information is taken from page 13 of the Abbott Laboratories 2002 Proxy Statement. The 1999 Consent Decree information is taken from a
November 2, 1999 United States Food and Drug Administration press release. The TAP settlement is 

18

 

from an October 3, 2001 US Department of Justice press release. Since TAP is a 50% owned joint venture, Abbott's share of the settlement is $437,500,000. The 2002 Consent Decree information is
taken from a July 11, 2002 Abbott press release, answer to question number 15 and is pretax income. Abbott verbally informed me that the 2002 payment of $129,000,000 relates to the 1999 Consent
Decree and includes related charges not paid to the government.  

 
 
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to Shareholder Proposal on Executive Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card)     
As
a health care company, Abbott operates in an increasingly complex, highly regulated environment in which regulatory standards and industry practices continue to evolve. Abbott's management is
committed to ensuring regulatory and legal compliance worldwide, and to promoting the highest ethical standards in our business practices. 
This
spirit of ethical leadership is embodied in the company's management systems and programs. For example, Abbott's Code of Business Conduct provides guidelines to all employees on ethical and legal
issues. Furthermore, Abbott's Office of Ethics and Compliance, established in 2000, makes available to employees a number of resources to enhance compliance, including an Ethics and Compliance
Helpline, toll-free number available to all employees 24 hours a day, seven days a week; division level compliance staff; and extensive in-person as well as
web-based training programs. 
If
legal or compliance issues do arise, management is charged with resolving them in the long-term interests of shareholders, patients and employees. In some circumstances, because of the
uncertain legal environment, these interests are best served through settlement of disputes, regardless of fault. Such settlements minimize legal costs and risks of protracted litigation, as well as
avoid disruption to the business. 
Linking
executive compensation to a single dimension such as settlement decisions is inappropriate. Abbott's total compensation program is competitive and performance driven, aligning compensation
with the achievement of annual and long-term goals, and the company's values. Compensation decisions are based on multiple dimensions designed to ensure that management is furthering
shareholder interests. Management's incentive compensation reflects these multiple dimensions. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.  

  
 
 Other Matters     
In
1999, shareholder derivative actions were filed against Abbott's then current directors and certain former directors relating to Abbott's alleged noncompliance with the United States Food and Drug
Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Division facilities in Lake County, Illinois. In March 2001, the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois dismissed these complaints. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Although in June 2002, the Seventh Circuit reversed the District
Court's dismissal of the claims, in August the Seventh Circuit withdrew its opinion. It has not issued a new opinion. These derivative actions alleged the defendants breached their fiduciary duties
by, among other things, allowing the alleged regulatory noncompliance and causing Abbott to pay $100 million to the federal government and withdraw certain medical diagnostic kits from the U.S.
market. The plaintiffs requested unspecified monetary damages, including punitive and exemplary damages, to be paid to Abbott, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various other forms of
relief. 
In
2001, shareholder derivative suits relating to the settlements reached by TAP Pharmaceutical Products Inc. with the United States Department of Justice and with each of the fifty states and
the District of Columbia with respect to certain of TAP's marketing and pricing practices were filed in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois against all of Abbott's current directors, with the
exception of R. A. Gonzalez (who was not a director at the time of the settlements). TAP is a 50 percent owned joint venture of Abbott. These derivative actions allege that the defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to take action to prevent these marketing and pricing practices. The plaintiffs request a return of salaries, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs,
and various other forms of relief. 
As
required by its articles of incorporation, Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of the present and former directors named in these suits.  

 
 
Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2004 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement     
Shareholder
proposals for presentation at the 2004 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 12, 2003 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2004 meeting. 

19

 

 
 
Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting     
A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and board affairs committee or the
secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. 
A
shareholder may directly nominate persons for director only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit the names of such persons in writing to the secretary of Abbott not
earlier than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. The nominations must be accompanied by a statement setting forth the name, age,
business address, residence address, principal occupation, qualifications, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominee and the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the
shareholder making the nomination. 
A
shareholder may properly bring business before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit to the secretary of Abbott, not earlier
than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting, a written statement describing the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting
such business at the Annual Meeting, the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the shareholder making the submission, and a description of any material interest of the
shareholder in such business. 

 
 
General     
It
is important that proxies be returned promptly. Shareholders are urged, regardless of the number of shares owned, to vote their shares. Most of Abbott's shareholders may vote their shares by
telephone or the Internet. Shareholders who wish to vote by mail should sign and return their proxy card in the enclosed business reply envelope. Shareholders who vote by telephone or the Internet do
not need to return their proxy card. 
The
Annual Meeting will be held at Abbott's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, located at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. Admission to the meeting will
be by admission card only. A shareholder planning to attend the meeting should promptly complete and return the reservation form. Reservation forms must be received before April 18, 2003. An
admission card admits no more than two people.

order of the board of directors.

EXHIBIT A 

 
 
ABBOTT LABORATORIES AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER     
    
1.  Purpose.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors shall assist the Board in fulfilling
its oversight responsibility with respect to: 


Abbott's
accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process,
the
quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements,
the
independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance,
the
performance of Abbott's internal audit function and internal auditors, and
those
legal and regulatory requirements that affect the other areas for which the Audit Committee has oversight responsibility; 

and
shall prepare the report required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in Abbott's annual proxy statement. 
    2.  Organization.  The Audit Committee shall be composed of
at least three (3) directors. Each member must satisfy the independence and financial literacy requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, the rules under Section 10A, and this charter. At least one member of the Audit Committee shall have accounting or related financial management expertise. Director's fees are
the only compensation an Audit Committee member may receive from Abbott. No member of the Audit Committee may serve simultaneously on the audit committee of more than three public companies. 
    3.  Authority and Responsibilities.  The Audit Committee is
directly responsible for the appointment, termination, compensation, and oversight of the work of Abbott's independent auditors (including the resolution of disagreements between management and the
independent auditors regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. It shall report regularly to the Board. 
Abbott's
independent auditors shall report directly to the Audit Committee. Abbott's internal auditors shall be ultimately accountable to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. The Audit
Committee shall preapprove all audit and non-audit services provided to Abbott by the independent auditors and the fees for those services. 
The
Audit Committee may, to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate, conduct or authorize investigations into any matter within the scope of its authority and may retain legal counsel,
accountants and others to assist it in the conduct of its responsibilities, including investigations. The Audit Committee may consult with management and may delegate any of its responsibilities and
duties to one or more members of the Audit Committee, except to the extent such delegation would be inconsistent with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
The
Audit Committee shall: 


Prepare
the report required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be included in Abbott's annual proxy statement.
Meet
separately, periodically, with Abbott's independent auditors, with Abbott's management and with Abbott's internal auditors.

Abbott's management and internal auditors. In connection with this evaluation and appointment, the Audit Committee shall obtain and review a report by Abbott's then current independent auditors
describing:


the
independent auditors' internal quality-control procedures;
any
material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the independent auditors, or by any inquiry
or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the independent auditors, and any steps taken to
deal with any such issues; and
all
relationships between the independent auditors and Abbott. 


A-1

 




        The
Audit Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors any relationships disclosed in that report and shall, if necessary, take appropriate action to ensure the auditors'
independence.

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee shall also consider the regular rotation of Abbott's independent auditors and
report its conclusions to the Board.
Review
and discuss with management and the independent auditors,


the
annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements, including Abbott's disclosures under Management's Discussion and

the
scope, procedures and fees for the proposed audit for the current year and, at its conclusion, review that audit including any comments or
recommendations by the independent auditors;

releases, as well as financial information and earnings guidance (generally, or on a case by case basis) provided to analysts and
rating agencies; and
the
responsibilities, budget and staffing of Abbott's internal audit function. 





Review
and discuss with Abbott's independent auditors,


any
problems or difficulties encountered in the course of the audit work, including any restrictions on the scope of the independent auditors'
activities or on access to requested information and management's response, and any significant disagreements with management,
any
report by the independent auditors required by Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including any report
related to critical accounting policies and practices to be used in connection with the audit of Abbott, all alternative treatments of financial information within generally accepted accounting
principles that have been discussed with management, the ramifications of the use of those alternative disclosures and treatments, and the treatment preferred by the independent auditors, and other
material written communications between the independent auditors and management, and
any
information obtained from the independent auditors with respect to illegal acts in accordance with Section 10A. 





Review
and discuss with Abbott's internal auditors the internal audit function, the department's authority and responsibilities, budget, staffing,
independence, and reporting obligations, the proposed audit plan for the coming year, the coordination of that proposed audit plan with Abbott's independent auditors, the results of the internal audit
and a specific review of any significant issues.
Review
and discuss with management Abbott's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those exposures,
including Abbott's risk assessment and risk management policies.
Adopt
guidelines governing the hiring of employees or former employees of the independent auditors who were engaged on Abbott's account.
Establish
procedures for


the
receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by Abbott regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters,
and
the
confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. 





Review
any disclosures made to the Audit Committee by Abbott's chief executive officer or chief financial officer relating to their certification obligations
under the Rule 13(a)-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

review and assess the adequacy of its charter annually and recommend any proposed changes to the Board for approval. It also shall conduct an annual evaluation of the Audit Committee's performance,
including a review of:

issues regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentations, including significant changes in Abbott's selection or application of
accounting principles and major issues as to the adequacy of Abbott's internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in light of material control deficiencies,
analyses
prepared by management or Abbott's independent auditors setting forth significant financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with
the preparation of financial statements, including analyses of the effects of alternative GAAP methods on the financial statements,
the
effect of regulatory and accounting initiatives, as well as off-balance sheet structures (if any), on Abbott's financial statements, and
earnings
press releases (paying particular attention to any use of "pro-forma" or "adjusted" non-GAAP information), as well as
financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and rating agencies.
