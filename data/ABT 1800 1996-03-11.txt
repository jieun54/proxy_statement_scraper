ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 26,
1996 at the corporation's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, at the
intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy
statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or
about March 11, 1996. The corporation will bear the cost of making solicitations
from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies
may also be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees
of the corporation and its subsidiaries. The corporation has also retained
Georgeson & Company Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated
cost of $42,000 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 1996 will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of January 31,
1996, the corporation had 786,075,095 outstanding common shares, which are the
only outstanding voting securities.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING OF PROXIES

A shareholder may vote in person, by a duly executed proxy, or through an
authorized representative. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize
no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies
may be revoked at any time prior to the meeting. This may be done by written
notice delivered to the secretary of the corporation, or by signing and
delivering a proxy with a later date.

All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected.

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive
to elect the 13 nominees hereinafter named. These

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

shares may be voted cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive
fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee
become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute
designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable.

Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against approval of either the
Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program or ratification of Arthur
Andersen LLP as auditors, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as
specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR
approval of the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program and FOR
ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors.

A majority of the outstanding shares, entitled to vote on a matter, represented
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of
the shareholders with respect to that matter.

A proxy may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such
proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur,
for example, when a broker or bank is not permitted to vote stock held in street
name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present
and, therefore, not entitled to vote on such matter, although these shares may
be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares
will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be
decided at the meeting.

The favorable vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and
entitled to vote on these matters are required for approval of these matters.
Abstentions and withheld votes have the effect of votes against a matter.

It is the corporation's policy that all proxies, ballots and voting tabulations
that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not
be disclosed except: (i) where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
(ii) where disclosure may be necessary in order for the corporation to assert or
defend claims, (iii) where a shareholder writes comments on his or her proxy
card, (iv) where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, (v) to allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or (vi) in limited
circumstances such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved
and recommended by the board of directors.

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots and voting
tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not employees of
the corporation.

The board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be
brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of
the proxy holders.

- --------------------------------------------------

INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY OWNERSHIP

On January 31, 1996, the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust, c/o Abbott
Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500, held
64,482,761 common shares (approximately 8.2 percent of the outstanding common
shares) of the corporation. These shares were held for the individual accounts
of approximately 37,467 employees and other plan participants who participate in
the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan. The Stock Retirement Trust is
administered by both a trustee and three co-trustees. The trustee of the Trust
is Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are G. P. Coughlan, T. C.
Freyman, and E. M. Walvoord, officers of the corporation. The voting power with
respect to the shares owned by the Trust is held by and shared among the
co-trustees. The co-trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions from
the participants, if the co-trustees determine that a matter to be voted on at a
shareholder meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The
individual participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by
the terms of the Trust. The Trust Agreement is of unlimited duration.

Weiss, held two meetings in 1995. This committee develops general criteria
regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, and
recommends candidates for such positions to the board of directors. A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director or directly
nominate persons for director by complying with the procedures on pages 19 and
20.

The board affairs committee, whose members are W. L. Weiss, chairman, K. F.
Austen, H. L. Fuller, The Lord Hayhoe PC, A. F. Jacobson, and D. A. Jones held

was 97 percent.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Report of the Compensation Committee

The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.

The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:

    - Integrates compensation programs with both the corporation's annual and
      long-term strategic planning and measurement processes.

    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.

    - Helps attract and retain key executives critical to the long-term success
      of the corporation.

The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.

The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies are included in the Standard and Poor's Healthcare
Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and
performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison.

Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements, base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.

In 1995, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.

Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively
taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining
the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases.

The Abbott Management Incentive Plan is designed to reward executives when the
corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's area
of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial
elements such as profitability, total sales, and earnings per share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Each year, individual incentive
targets are established for incentive plan participants based on competitive
survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, targets
are set to deliver total compensation between the mid and upper range of
competitive practice as warranted by corporate performance. For 1995, 40% of the
target award was earned for achievement of the corporation's earning per share
goal. The remainder of the targeted incentive was earned based on the
committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the
predetermined goals discussed above.

The corporation has provided forms of equity participation as a key part of its
total program for motivating and rewarding executives and managers for many
years. Grants of stock options and restricted stock

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               8

have provided an important part of the equity link to shareholders. Through
these vehicles, the corporation has encouraged its executives to obtain and hold
the corporation's stock. Targeted award ranges for stock options and restricted
stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice
among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation targets are set
based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the
target ranges are established such that equity participation opportunities will
be in the mid-to-upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
corporation and individual performance.

Actual individual awards are determined based on the established competitive
target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance.
The committee considers the amounts of options and restricted stock previously
granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional
options and restricted stock.

In 1995, the committee granted Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 3.5% which was consistent with the
corporation's established merit increase program. As reflected in the
corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 1995 included 9.4%
growth in sales and 13.4% growth in earnings per share. In light of this
performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the committee
determined to grant Mr. Burnham a bonus and stock option grant.

It is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for
executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and
its stockholders in achieving the corporation's long-term business objectives.
To that end, the committee will continue to assess the impact of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and
take action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

TABLE FOOTNOTES

(1) Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted in tandem with these
    options. These rights are only exercisable for sixty days following a change
    in control of the corporation. Upon exercise, the optionee must surrender
    the related option and will receive a payment, in cash, in an amount equal
    to the difference between the option's price and the fair market value of
    the shares subject to the option.

(2) One-third of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one
    year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.

(3) The dollar amounts under these columns are the result of calculations at the
    5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and, therefore, are not intended to
    forecast possible future appreciation, if any, of the stock price.

(4) Amounts were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 1995
    of 787,306,832 and December 31, 1995 closing market price of $41.625 per
    share.

Annuity Retirement Plan

The corporation and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan
known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees
in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on
service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120
months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits.

The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis without giving effect to Social Security offsets and include
supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. The compensation considered
in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation
shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on
page 10. One-third of the restricted stock awards granted to D. L. Burnham and
T. R. Hodgson in 1993 will also be included in the 1995 calculation of their
respective pensions. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are
funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on
behalf of all participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified
supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded
through individual trusts established on behalf of the participants in that
plan. During 1995, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were
deposited in such individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers:
D. L. Burnham, $787,696; T. R. Hodgson, $675,858; P. N. Clark, $74,078; G. P.
Coughlan, $178,869; and J. G. Kringel, $262,100. As of December 31, 1995, the
years of service credited under the Plan for the named officers were as follows:
D. L. Burnham - 13; T. R. Hodgson - 23; P. N. Clark -11; G. P. Coughlan - 5; and
J. G. Kringel - 15.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation of Directors

Employees of the corporation are not compensated for serving on the board or on
board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each
month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as chairman of a
board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee).

Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, or deferred (as a
non-funded obligation of the corporation or paid into a secular trust
established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or
upon retirement from the board of directors). If the fees are deferred, the
director may elect to have the fees credited to a stock equivalent account under
which the fees accrue the same return they would have earned if invested in
common shares of the corporation. Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees
not credited to a stock equivalent account.

Under the Plan, the corporation may grant a director who retires from the board
a retirement benefit, and such benefit will be payable to the surviving spouse
of any director who dies while serving as a director. The retirement benefit
consists of payment of an amount equal to the monthly director's fee in effect
on the date the director retires (or, for a director who dies, the fee in effect
on the date of death) for a period equal to his or her service on the board to a
maximum of 120 months. In return for the retirement benefit, the director agrees
to provide consulting services to the board.

Under the Abbott Laboratories 1991 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee
director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder
meeting receives a restricted stock award with a fair market value on the date
of the award closest to, but not exceeding, twenty thousand dollars. In 1995,
this was 511 shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination,
retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of the corporation. The
non-employee directors are entitled to vote the shares and receive all dividends
paid on the shares. The Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program and the
compensation which the non-employee directors will receive under that Plan, if
it is approved by the shareholders, are described on pages 14 through 19.

In 1995, K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services for the
corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement in the areas of research and
development, new technology and immunopharmacology. The consulting agreement,
which expires on March 31, 1998, provides that the fees he earns under the
agreement may receive the same treatment as fees earned under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. In 1995, Dr. Austen received
$50,000 for his consulting services.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The corporation believes that during 1995 its officers and directors complied
with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, except as follows. Two reports covering purchases of common shares of
the corporation in 1995 by William D. Smithburg, a director of the corporation,
were filed late.

ABBOTT LABORATORIES 1996 INCENTIVE STOCK PROGRAM

(ITEM NO. 2 ON PROXY CARD)

  The board of directors has adopted, subject to ratification by the
shareholders, a new 1996 Incentive Stock Program (the "Program"). The text of
the Program, which will replace the 1991 Incentive Stock Program, is set forth
in Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The board of directors recommends that the
shareholders vote FOR the ratification of the Program.

  The purpose of the Program is to attract and retain outstanding individuals as
directors, officers and other employees of the corporation and its subsidiaries
and to furnish an incentive to such persons to increase profits by providing
them with the opportunity to acquire common shares of the corporation, or to
receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares or on the financial
performance of the corporation, or both, on advantageous terms and to further
align such persons' interests with those of the corporation's other shareholders
through compensation that is based on the value of the corporation's common
shares. The Program is designed to permit the corporation to provide several
different forms of benefits to meet competitive conditions and the particular
circumstances of the individuals who may be eligible to receive benefits. To
accomplish this purpose, the Program authorizes the grant of several different
forms of benefits including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, performance units, performance shares, and foreign
qualified benefits (the "Benefits").

  The Program authorizes the granting of options and other Benefits with respect
to an aggregate of: (i) 5,000,000 common shares of the corporation, plus (ii) an
annual additional authorization of seven-tenths of one percent (0.7%) of the
total common shares of the corporation issued and outstanding on the first day
of each calendar year beginning with 1996, plus (iii) shares authorized but
unissued under the prior programs; subject in each case to adjustments as
provided below. Based on the corporation's common shares issued and outstanding
as of January 1, 1996, the annual additional authorization for 1996 will be
5,511,147 common shares. Any common shares reserved under an annual additional
authorization for any calendar year as to which options or other Benefits have
not been awarded as of the end of such calendar year are available for issuance
under Benefits granted in subsequent years. The 5,000,000 shares initially
reserved under the Program, plus the annual additional authorization for 1996 of
common shares, equals approximately 1.3 percent of the corporation's outstanding
common shares as of January 31, 1996. On January 31, 1996, the closing price of
the corporation's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $42.50.

  As of January 31, 1996, options to purchase 28,783,436 common shares were
outstanding and 6,538,798 shares were reserved and available for additional
grants under the 1991 Program and its predecessor, the 1986 Program
(collectively, the "Prior Programs"). Following approval of the Program by the
shareholders, Benefits will no longer be granted under the 1991 Program, but the
shares reserved and not issued thereunder will be added to the shares authorized
and reserved for Benefits under the Program. (At the time of shareholder
approval of the 1991 Program, similar provision was made with respect to shares
reserved but not issued under the 1986 Program.)

  The common shares covered by the Program may be either authorized but unissued
shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards may be satisfied
only from treasury shares). If there is a lapse, expiration, termination, or
cancellation of any Benefit granted under the Program or under the Prior
Programs without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder, or if
shares are issued under any Benefit under the Program or a Prior Program and
thereafter are reacquired by the corporation pursuant to rights reserved upon
the issuance thereof, or pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares
under stock options by delivery of other common shares of the corporation, the
shares subject to or reserved for such Benefit, or so reacquired, may again be
used for new options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the
Program. However, the common shares issued under the Program, which are not
reacquired by the corporation pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance
thereof or pursuant to payment of the purchase price of shares under stock
options by delivery of other common shares of the corporation, may not exceed
the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the Program.

  In the event of the exercise of a stock appreciation right or a limited stock
appreciation right, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Program
shall be reduced by the number of common shares covered by the option or portion
thereof which is surrendered in

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              14

connection with such exercise. The number of shares reserved for issuance under
the Program also shall be reduced by the largest whole number obtained by
dividing the monetary value of performance units granted at the commencement of
a performance period by the market value of a common share at such time.

  Except as provided by the Committee, Benefits granted under the Program will
be exercisable only by the holder during the holder's lifetime; provided,
however, that such Benefits will be transferable by will or by the laws of
descent and distribution.

  The following summary of certain provisions of the Program is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the copy of the Program set forth in Exhibit A to this
proxy statement.
- --------------------------------------------------

Administration

The Program provides that grants of options and other Benefits and other
determinations under the Program shall be made by the compensation committee of
the board of directors or such other committee consisting entirely of persons
who are both: (i) "disinterested persons" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the
Securities Exchange Commission; and (ii) "outside directors" as defined under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, (the "Committee") except
that the Committee may delegate its authority to the extent consistent with
applicable law and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, and except
that the Chief Executive Officer may grant options and restricted stock awards
other than to directors and executive officers, subject to ratification by the
Committee.
- --------------------------------------------------

Eligibility

Officers and other employees of the corporation and its subsidiaries (including
the persons named in the table on page 10 and directors who are employees)
selected by the Committee will be eligible to receive options and other Benefits
under the Program. Directors who are not employees of the corporation or its
subsidiaries shall also be participants in the Program solely for purposes of
receiving certain restricted stock awards and non-qualified stock options (see
discussion on pages 17 and 18).

  There are limits imposed on shares covered by restricted stock awards and
non-qualified stock options that may be granted to non-employee directors (see
pages 17 and 18). The maximum number of shares with respect to which incentive
stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and
limited stock appreciation rights may be granted to any one participant, in
aggregate, in any one calendar year, is one million shares. There is no maximum
number of persons eligible to receive options and other Benefits under the
Program. The Program provides that the aggregate fair market value (determined
as of the time the option is granted) of the common shares with respect to which
incentive stock options may become exercisable for the first time by any
individual during any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. However, in no
event shall incentive stock options be granted with respect to more than
75,000,000 shares (plus any shares acquired by the corporation pursuant to
payment of the purchase price of shares under incentive stock options by
delivery of other common shares of the corporation). It is currently estimated
that the group of eligible employees under the Program will approximate 1,650
persons, with appropriate adjustments for any significant change in size or
operations of the corporation in the future. No determination has been made
under the Program regarding the identity of the persons to whom options or other
Benefits may be granted or the number of shares which may be allocated to any
specific person or persons.
- --------------------------------------------------

Duration

The Program will continue in effect until terminated by the board of directors,
except that no incentive stock option may be granted more than ten years after
the date of adoption of the Program by the board of directors.
- --------------------------------------------------

Adjustments

The Program provides for adjustment in the number of shares reserved and in the
shares covered by each outstanding Benefit in the event of a stock dividend or
stock split and for continuation of Benefits and other equitable adjustment in
the event of reorganization, sale, merger, consolidation, spin-off, or similar
occurrence.
- --------------------------------------------------

Options

The Program provides that the purchase price of any incentive stock option or
non-qualified stock option shall be at least 100 percent of the fair market
value of the common shares at the time the option is granted. The Committee may
provide for the payment of the purchase price in cash, by delivery of other
common shares of the corporation having a market value equal to the purchase
price of such shares, or by any other method, such as delivery of short-term,
unsecured promissory notes. A participant may pay the purchase price by delivery
of an exercise notice accompanied by a copy of irrevocable instructions to a
broker to deliver promptly to the corporation sale or loan proceeds to pay the
purchase price. The Committee may also permit pyramiding by optionees.
Pyramiding occurs when an optionee exercises stock options in increasing
portions by using each

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15

portion and the appreciation inherent in the shares obtained to exercise a
larger portion of the option. Theoretically, by using this approach, an optionee
could purchase one share for cash and continue to use the shares obtained to
exercise the entire option in successively larger exercises. The result could be
that the optionee would receive shares of stock equal in value to the entire
spread between market price and option purchase price with only a minimal cash
payment.

  The Committee may permit or require a participant to pay all or a portion of
the federal, state and local taxes, including FICA and medicare withholding tax,
arising in connection with the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the
vesting of a restricted stock award or the receipt or exercise of any other
Benefit, by having the corporation withhold shares or by delivering shares
received in connection with the Benefit or previously acquired, having a fair
market value approximating the amount to be withheld.

  The Committee may add conditions and limitations to any Benefit granted to any
participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, or to any feature of such Benefit as the Committee deems necessary
or desirable to comply with such Section and the rules thereunder, or to obtain
an exemption therefrom.

  The Committee may grant stock options under the Program and under the 1991
Program that provide for the automatic grant of replacement stock options if all
or any portion of the purchase price or taxes incurred in connection with the
exercise are paid by delivery or withholding of common shares of the
corporation. The replacement stock option will cover the number of shares
surrendered to pay the purchase price, surrendered or withheld to pay the
participant's tax liability, if any, will have an exercise price equal to the
fair market value of such shares on the date the replacement stock option is
granted, will be exercisable in full six months from the date of grant and will
expire on the expiration date of the original stock option.

  The period of any option will be determined by the Committee, but no option
may be exercised earlier than six months, nor after the expiration of ten years,
from the date it is granted. The Program contains special rules covering the
time of exercise in case of retirement, death, disability, or other termination
of employment. The Program also provides that, notwithstanding any other
provision, upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the
Program) of the corporation, all stock options (whether or not then exercisable)
shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control.
- --------------------------------------------------

Stock Appreciation Rights

A stock appreciation right will permit the holder of an option to elect to
surrender any option or portion thereof which is then exercisable and receive in
exchange therefor common shares, cash, or a combination thereof. Such cash,
stock, or combination shall have an aggregate value equal to the excess of the
fair market value on the date of such election of one common share over the
purchase price specified in such option multiplied by the number of shares
covered by such option or portion thereof which is so surrendered.

  A stock appreciation right may be granted with respect to a stock option
either at the time of its grant or afterwards and may be granted with respect to
stock options granted under both the Program and the Prior Programs. A stock
appreciation right may be granted to an employee regardless of whether such
employee has been granted a limited stock appreciation right with respect to the
same stock option; provided, however, that a stock appreciation right may not be
exercised during any period that a limited stock appreciation right with respect
to the same stock option may be exercised. A stock appreciation right granted to
a participant who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, may be exercised only after six months from its grant date
(unless such exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the
Securities and Exchange Commission). A stock appreciation right shall be
exercisable upon such additional terms and conditions as may be prescribed by
the Committee in its sole discretion, but in no event shall it be exercisable
after the expiration of the related stock option. The Program provides that upon
the occurrence of a Change in Control of the corporation, all stock appreciation
rights shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control
(subject to the six month holding requirement described above).
- --------------------------------------------------

Limited Stock Appreciation Rights

The Program also permits the grant of limited stock appreciation rights to the
holder of any option previously granted under the Program or any Prior Program.
A limited stock appreciation right may be granted to an employee regardless of
whether such employee has been granted a stock appreciation right with respect
to the same stock option. A limited stock appreciation right will permit the
holder of an option to surrender the option or portion thereof which is then
exercisable and receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the
excess of the fair market value on the date of such election of one common share
over the purchase price specified in such option multiplied by the number of
shares covered by such option or portion thereof which

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              16

is so surrendered. A limited stock appreciation right granted to a participant
who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
may be exercised only after six months from its date of grant (unless such
exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission) and only during the sixty-day period commencing with the
day following the date of a Change in Control of the corporation or, if later,
the first date on which such exercise would be exempt under SEC Rule 16b-3. In
addition, a limited stock appreciation right shall be exercisable upon such
additional terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Committee, in its
sole discretion, but in no event shall it be exercisable after the expiration of
the related stock option. The Program provides that upon the occurrence of a
Change in Control of the corporation, all limited stock appreciation rights
shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control (subject
to the six month holding requirement described above).
- --------------------------------------------------

Restricted Stock Awards

Restricted stock awards will consist of common shares transferred to
participants, without other payment therefor, as additional compensation for
their services to the corporation or one of its subsidiaries. Restricted stock
awards shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines
are appropriate, including without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other
disposition of such shares and rights of the corporation to reacquire such
shares upon termination of the participant's employment within specified
periods. Subject to such other restrictions as are imposed by the Committee, the
common shares covered by a restricted stock award granted to a participant who
is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may
be sold or otherwise disposed of only after six months from the grant date of
the award (unless such sale would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of
the Securities and Exchange Commission). The Program provides that upon the
occurrence of a Change in Control of the corporation, all terms and conditions
of all restricted stock awards then outstanding shall be deemed to be satisfied
as of the date of the Change in Control. No more than ten percent (10%) of the
total shares available for issuance in connection with Benefits granted in any
calendar year may be issued as restricted stock awards, including restricted
stock awards granted to non-employee directors as described on pages 17 and 18.
- --------------------------------------------------

Performance Awards

The Program permits the grant of performance awards in the form of performance
units or performance shares. Performance units consist of monetary awards and
performance shares consist of common shares or awards denominated in common
shares, which may be earned in whole or in part if the corporation achieves
certain goals established by the Committee over a designated period of time. The
goals established by the Committee shall be based on any one or a combination of
earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets, total shareholder
return, net operating income, cash flow, increase in revenue, economic value
added, increase in share price or cash flow return on investment. Partial
achievement of goals may result in payment or vesting corresponding to the
degree of achievement. Payment of an award earned may be in cash or in common
shares, or in a combination of both, and may be made when earned, or vested and
deferred, as the Committee in its sole discretion determines. Deferred awards
shall earn interest on the terms and at a rate determined by the Committee. The
maximum amount which may be granted under all performance awards for any one
year for any one participant is five million dollars. The Program provides that
upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of the corporation, all performance
awards then outstanding shall be deemed to have been fully earned and are
immediately payable, in cash, as of the date of the Change in Control.
- --------------------------------------------------

Foreign Qualified Benefits

Benefits under the Program may also be granted to such officers and employees of
the corporation and its subsidiaries who are residing in foreign jurisdictions
as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine from time to time. The
Committee may adopt such supplements to the Program as may be necessary to
comply with the applicable laws of such foreign jurisdictions and to afford such
employees favorable treatment under such laws; provided, however, that no
Benefit shall be granted under any such supplement with terms or conditions
which are inconsistent with the provisions set forth under the Program.
- --------------------------------------------------

Restricted Stock Awards and Options for Non-Employee Directors

The Program also provides that restricted stock awards will automatically be
granted each person elected a director of the corporation at the annual
shareholders meeting in any of the years 1996 through 2005 who is not an
employee of the corporation or one of its subsidiaries ("non-employee
directors"). The awards will be granted on the dates the persons are elected as
directors, and each award shall cover a number of common shares with a fair
market value on the grant date closest to, but not in excess of, Twenty-Two
Thousand Dollars ($22,000) for awards made in years 1996 through 2000 and
Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) for awards made in years 2001 through
2005. The shares covered by the awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged, hypothecated, or

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17

otherwise disposed of for six months after their grant dates (unless such sales
would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission) nor until the earlier of the date the director terminates or retires
from the board of directors or the occurrence of a Change in Control.

  The program also permits non-employee directors to elect to receive any or all
of their directors' fees earned during the second half of 1996 and in subsequent
years in the form of non-qualified stock options. The fees earned in any year
that are covered by any such election shall be converted to stock options based
on an independent appraisal for such year of the value of such options. The
number of shares covered by such options granted in 1996 shall be three times
the fees covered by the election, divided by the fair market value of such
shares on the grant date. Such options shall be granted on the date the
corresponding fees would otherwise be paid and at a purchase price equal to the
fair market value of the shares covered by the option on the grant date. Each
such option shall be fully exercisable after six months from the grant date and
shall not be exercisable after ten years from the grant date.

  The following table shows the number of shares that would have been granted to
non-employee directors as restricted stock awards and the number of common
shares covered by options that could be received by non-employee directors in
lieu of directors' fees earned during 1996 had the Program been in effect since
the beginning of the year:



                                      Restricted
                                         Stock       Number of
Name and Position                       Awards     Option Shares
  
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Employee Director Group.........       5,731        41,385
- ---------------------------------------------------------------


  While the above table assumes that all fees earned in 1996 would be converted
to stock options, the Program allows only fees earned in the second half of 1996
and fees earned in subsequent years to be converted to options. The table also
assumes that all non-employee directors will elect to receive all of the fees
they earn during 1996 in the form of stock options. These amounts are based on
the current level of fees and assume a share price for the purpose of converting
fees to options of $42.1875, the average of the high and low trading prices of
common shares on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index on January 31,
1996. With respect to the restricted stock awards, the table is calculated on
the basis of the trading prices on January 31, 1996. The actual number of
restricted stock awards will depend on the fair market value of the common
shares on April 26, 1996, the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
- --------------------------------------------------

Amendments and Discontinuance

The Program is subject to amendment or termination by the board of directors
without shareholder approval as deemed in the best interests of the corporation.
However, no such amendment shall, without the consent of the holder, reduce the
amount of any Benefit or adversely change the terms and conditions thereof, nor
shall any such amendment result in any Committee member losing his or her status
as a "disinterested person" with respect to any employee benefit plan of the
corporation, or the Program or any award thereunder losing its exempt status,
under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  The terms and conditions applicable to any Benefits granted and outstanding
may at any time be amended, modified, or canceled by mutual agreement between
the Committee and the participant so long as any amendment or modification does
not increase the number of common shares issuable under the Program. The
Committee may, at any time and in its sole discretion, declare any or all stock
options and stock appreciation rights then outstanding under the Program or the
Prior Programs to be exercisable and any or all outstanding restricted stock
awards to be vested, whether or not such options, rights or awards are otherwise
exercisable or vested.
- --------------------------------------------------

Federal Income Tax Consequences

Under existing law and regulations, the grant of non-qualified stock options,
limited stock appreciation rights and stock appreciation rights will not result
in income taxable to the employee or director or provide a deduction to the
corporation. However, the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, a stock
appreciation right or a limited stock appreciation right results in taxable
income to the holder, and the corporation is entitled to a corresponding
deduction. At the time of the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the
amount so taxable and so deductible will be the excess of the fair market value
of the shares purchased over their option price. Upon the exercise of a stock
appreciation right or limited stock appreciation right, the participant will be
taxed at ordinary income tax rates on the amount of the cash and the fair market
value of the shares received by the employee, and the corporation will be
entitled to a corresponding deduction.

  Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"), no income is recognized
by an optionee when an incentive stock option is granted or exercised. If the
holder holds the shares received on exercise of an incentive stock option for at
least two years from the date of grant and one year from date of exercise, any
gain realized by the holder on the disposition of the stock will be accorded
long-term capital gain treatment, and no deduction is allowed to the
corporation. If the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              18

holding period requirements are not satisfied, the employee will recognize
ordinary income at the time of disposition equal to the lesser of (i) the gain
realized on the disposition, or (ii) the difference between the option price and
the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise. Any additional gain
on the disposition not reflected above will be long-term or short-term capital
gain, depending upon the length of time the shares are held. The corporation is
entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income
recognized by the employee.

  An employee or nonemployee director who is granted a restricted stock award
will not be taxed upon the acquisition of such shares so long as the interest in
such shares is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning
of Section 83 of the Code. Upon lapse or release of the restrictions, the
recipient will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on an amount equal to the
current fair market value of the shares. Any awards that are not subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture, will be taxed at the time of grant. The
corporation will be entitled to a corresponding deduction when the value of the
award is included in the recipient's taxable income. The basis of restricted
shares held after lapse or termination of restrictions will be equal to their
fair market value on the date of lapse or termination of restrictions, and upon
subsequent disposition any further gain or loss will be long-term or short-term
capital gain or loss, depending upon the length of time the shares are held.

  An employee or nonemployee director may elect to be taxed at ordinary income
tax rates on the full fair market value of the restricted shares at the time of
transfer. If the election is made, the basis of the shares so acquired will be
equal to the fair market value at the time of transfer. If the election is made,
no tax will be payable upon the subsequent lapse or release of the restrictions,
and any gain or loss upon disposition will be a capital gain or loss.

  A participant will realize ordinary income as a result of performance awards
at the time common shares are transferred or cash is paid in an amount equal to
the value of the shares delivered plus the cash paid.

- --------------------------------------------------

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
(ITEM NO. 3 ON PROXY CARD)

The bylaws of the corporation provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit
committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent
public accountants to serve as auditors, and that such appointment shall be
submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board
has appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This
firm has served as auditors of the corporation since 1963. The board of
directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen
LLP as independent public accountants for 1996.

Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to
do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.

- --------------------------------------------------

DATE FOR RECEIPT OF 1997 SHAREHOLDER
PROPOSALS

Shareholder proposals for presentation at the 1997 Annual Meeting must be
received by the corporation no later than November 13, 1996 and must otherwise
comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for
the 1997 meeting.

- --------------------------------------------------

OTHER MATTERS

Over the course of the past year, the corporation advanced defense costs on
behalf of a number of current and former officers and directors in connection
with ABBOTT LABORATORIES DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. This is a consolidated
shareholder derivative action instituted in May and June of 1993 against all of
the corporation's present directors (other than Allen F. Jacobson) and a former
executive officer that was pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County,
Illinois. The complaint sought to hold the defendants liable for an amount
exceeding $140 million, in connection with the corporation's settlement of
certain antitrust litigation arising out of its marketing of infant formula,
plus additional unspecified damages, on the ground that the defendants had a
duty to prevent or correct the conduct that gave rise to the underlying claims.
On December 15, 1995, the Circuit Court of Cook County dismissed the action.
Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal.

- --------------------------------------------------

ABBOTT LABORATORIES 1996 INCENTIVE STOCK PROGRAM                       EXHIBIT A
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  PURPOSE.  The  purpose of  the  Abbott Laboratories  1996  Incentive Stock
Program (the "Program") is to attract and retain outstanding directors, officers
and other employees of Abbott Laboratories (the "Company") and its subsidiaries,
and to furnish incentives to such persons by providing opportunities to  acquire
common  shares of the Company,  or monetary payments based  on the value of such
shares or the  financial performance of  the Company, or  both, on  advantageous
terms as herein provided and to further align such persons' interests with those
of  the Company's other  shareholders through compensation that  is based on the
value of the Company's common shares.

  2. ADMINISTRATION.  The  Program will  be  administered by  a  committee  (the
"Committee")  of at  least two  persons which  shall be  either the Compensation
Committee of  the Board  of Directors  of the  Company or  such other  committee
comprised  entirely  of persons  who are  both:  (i) "disinterested  persons" as
defined in  Rule 16b-3  of  the Securities  and  Exchange Commission;  and  (ii)
"outside directors" as defined under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
of  1986, as amended; or any successor  provision, as the Board of Directors may
from time  to  time  designate.  The  Committee  shall  interpret  the  Program,
prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating thereto and make all
other  determinations  necessary  or  advisable for  the  administration  of the
Program. A majority of  the members of the  Committee shall constitute a  quorum
and  all determinations  of the  Committee shall  be made  by a  majority of its
members. Any  determination of  the  Committee under  the  Program may  be  made
without  notice of meeting  of the Committee by  a writing signed  by all of the
Committee members. The Committee may, from time to time, delegate any or all  of
its  duties, powers  and authority  to any officer  or officers  of the Company,
except to the extent  such delegation would be  inconsistent with Rule 16b-3  of
the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  or  other  applicable  law,  rule or
regulation. The Chief  Executive Officer of  the Company may,  on behalf of  the
Committee,  grant stock options  and restricted stock  awards under the Program,
other than to persons subject  to Section 16 of  the Securities Exchange Act  of
1934.  All such grants by  the Chief Executive Officer  must be reported to, and
ratified by,  the Committee  within twelve  months  of the  grant date  but,  if
ratified, shall be effective as of the grant date.

  3. PARTICIPANTS. Participants in the Program will consist of such officers and
other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries as the Committee in its sole
discretion  may designate from  time to time to  receive Benefits hereunder. The
Committee's designation  of a  participant in  any year  shall not  require  the
Committee  to designate such person to receive  a Benefit in any other year. The
Committee shall  consider  such  factors  as it  deems  pertinent  in  selecting
participants  and  in  determining  the  type  and  amount  of  their respective
Benefits, including  without  limitation  (i) the  financial  condition  of  the
Company;  (ii)  anticipated  profits  for the  current  or  future  years; (iii)
contributions of  participants  to  the profitability  and  development  of  the
Company;  (iv) prior awards to participants; and (v) other compensation provided
to participants.  Non-Employee  Directors  shall also  be  participants  in  the
Program solely for purposes of receiving Restricted Stock Awards under paragraph
13  and Non-qualified Stock  Options under paragraph  14. The term "Non-Employee
Director" shall mean a member of the  Board of Directors who is not a  full-time
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  4.  TYPES OF BENEFITS. Benefits under the Program may be granted in any one or
a combination of (a) Incentive  Stock Options; (b) Non-qualified Stock  Options;
(c)  Stock  Appreciation  Rights;  (d) Limited  Stock  Appreciation  Rights; (e)
Restricted Stock  Awards;  (f) Performance  Awards;  and (g)  Foreign  Qualified
Benefits, all as described below.

  5.  SHARES RESERVED UNDER  THE PROGRAM. There is  hereby reserved for issuance
under the Program: (i) an aggregate  of Five Million (5,000,000) common  shares;
plus  (ii) an authorization for each  calendar year (the "Annual Authorization")
from and including  1996, of  seven-tenths of one  percent (0.7%)  of the  total
common  shares of the Company issued and outstanding as of the first day of such
calendar year; which may be newly  issued or treasury shares. The shares  hereby
reserved  are in addition to the  shares previously reserved under the Company's
1981 Incentive Stock Program,  1986 Incentive Stock  Program and 1991  Incentive
Stock  Program (the "Prior  Programs"). Any common  shares reserved for issuance
under the Prior Programs in excess of  the number of shares as to which  options
or  other Benefits have been awarded on the date of shareholder approval of this
Program, plus any  such shares  as to which  options or  other Benefits  granted
under  the Prior Programs may lapse, expire, terminate or be canceled after such
date, shall  also be  reserved and  available for  issuance in  connection  with
Benefits  under this Program.  Any common shares reserved  under the Program for
any calendar year  under an Annual  Authorization as to  which options or  other
Benefits  have not  been awarded as  of the end  of such calendar  year shall be
available for issuance in connection with Benefits granted in subsequent years.

If there is  a lapse,  expiration, termination  or cancellation  of any  Benefit
granted  hereunder without the issuance of shares or payment of cash thereunder,
or if shares are issued under any  Benefit and thereafter are reacquired by  the
Company  pursuant to  rights reserved upon  the issuance thereof,  or shares are
reacquired pursuant to the payment of  the purchase price of shares under  stock
options by delivery of other common shares of the Company, the shares subject to
or  reserved  for such  Benefit, or  so reacquired,  may again  be used  for new
options, rights or awards of any  sort authorized under this Program;  provided,
however,  that in  no event may  the number  of common shares  issued under this
Program, and not

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A-1

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance  thereof
or  pursuant to the payment of the  purchase price of shares under stock options
by delivery of other common  shares of the Company,  exceed the total number  of
shares reserved for issuance hereunder.

  6. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS. Incentive Stock Options will consist of options to
purchase  common shares  at purchase  prices not  less than  One Hundred percent
(100%) of the Fair Market Value of such  common shares on the date of grant.  An
Incentive  Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10)
years from the  date such  option is  granted. In  the event  of termination  of
employment  for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, the right
of the optionee to exercise an  Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon  the
earlier  of the end of the original term of the option or three (3) months after
the optionee's last day  of work for  the Company and  its subsidiaries. In  the
event  of termination of employment  due to retirement or  disability, or if the
optionee should die  while employed, the  right of  the optionee or  his or  her
successor in interest to exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall terminate upon
the  end of the original  term of the option. If  the optionee should die within
three (3)  months after  termination of  employment for  any reason  other  than
retirement  or disability,  the right  of his  or her  successor in  interest to
exercise an Incentive Stock Option shall  terminate upon the earlier of the  end
of  the original term of the  option or three (3) months  after the date of such
death. To the extent the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the  time
the  Option is granted) of the common shares with respect to which any Incentive
Stock Option is  exercisable for  the first time  by any  individual during  any
calendar  year  (under  all  option  plans of  the  Company  and  its subsidiary
corporations) exceeds $100,000, the excess  shall be treated as a  Non-qualified
Stock  Option. An Incentive  Stock Option shall be  exercisable as determined by
the Committee, but in no event earlier than six (6) months from its grant date.

  7. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK  OPTIONS. Non-qualified Stock  Options will consist  of
options  to purchase common shares at purchase  prices not less than One Hundred
percent (100%) of the  Fair Market Value  of such common shares  on the date  of
grant. A Non-qualified Stock Option will not be exercisable after the expiration
of  ten  (10) years  from  the date  such  option is  granted.  In the  event of
termination of employment for  any reason other  than retirement, disability  or
death,  the right of the optionee to exercise a Non-qualified Stock Option shall
terminate upon the  earlier of the  end of the  original term of  the option  or
three  (3) months after the optionee's last day  of work for the Company and its
subsidiaries. In the  event of termination  of employment due  to retirement  or
disability,  or if  the optionee  should die  while employed,  the right  of the
optionee or his or her successor  in interest to exercise a Non-qualified  Stock
Option  shall terminate upon the end of the  original term of the option. If the
optionee should die within three (3) months after termination of employment  for
any  reason  other  than retirement  or  disability,  the right  of  his  or her
successor in interest to exercise  a Non-qualified Stock Option shall  terminate
upon  the earlier of  the end of  the original term  of the option  or three (3)
months after  the date  of such  death. A  Non-qualified Stock  Option shall  be
exercisable as determined by the Committee, but in no event earlier than six (6)
months from its grant date.

  8.  STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  The Committee may, in  its discretion, grant a
Stock Appreciation Right to the holder of any stock option granted hereunder  or
under  the Prior  Programs. Such Stock  Appreciation Rights shall  be subject to
such terms and  conditions consistent with  the Program as  the Committee  shall
impose from time to time, including the following:

    (a) A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted with respect to a stock option
  at  the time of its grant or at any time thereafter up to six (6) months prior
  to its expiration.

    (b) Stock  Appreciation  Rights will  permit  the holder  to  surrender  any
  related stock option or portion thereof which is then exercisable and to elect
  to receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to:

      (i)  The excess of the  Fair Market Value on the  date of such election of
    one common share over the option price multiplied by

      (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion thereof  which
    is so surrendered.

    (c)  A Stock Appreciation Right  granted to a participant  who is subject to
  Section 16  of  the  Securities Exchange  Act  of  1934, as  amended,  may  be
  exercised  only after six (6) months from its grant date (unless such exercise
  would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange
  Commission).

    (d) A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted to a participant regardless of
  whether such participant has been  granted a Limited Stock Appreciation  Right
  with respect to the same stock option. However, a Stock Appreciation Right may
  not  be exercised  during any period  that a Limited  Stock Appreciation Right
  with respect to the same stock option may be exercised.

    (e) In the event of the exercise  of a Stock Appreciation Right, the  number
  of  shares reserved for issuance  hereunder shall be reduced  by the number of
  shares covered by the stock option or portion thereof surrendered.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                             A-2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  9. LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION  RIGHTS. The Committee  may, in its  discretion,
grant  a Limited  Stock Appreciation  Right to  the holder  of any  stock option
granted hereunder or under the  Prior Programs. Such Limited Stock  Appreciation
Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the Program
as the Committee shall impose from time to time, including the following:

    (a)  A Limited  Stock Appreciation  Right may be  granted with  respect to a
  stock option at the time of its grant or at any time thereafter up to six  (6)
  months prior to its expiration.

    (b)  A Limited Stock Appreciation Right  will permit the holder to surrender
  any related stock option or portion  thereof which is then exercisable and  to
  receive in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to:

      (i)  The excess of the  Fair Market Value on the  date of such election of
    one common share over the option price multiplied by

      (ii) The number of shares covered by such option or portion thereof  which
    is so surrendered.

    (c)  A  Limited Stock  Appreciation Right  granted to  a participant  who is
  subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  may
  be  exercised  only after  six (6)  months  from its  grant date  (unless such
  exercise would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and
  Exchange Commission) and only during the  sixty (60) day period commencing  on
  the  later of: (i) the day following the  date of a Change in Control; or (ii)
  the first date on which such exercise would be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of  the
  Securities and Exchange Commission.

    (d)  A  Limited Stock  Appreciation Right  may be  granted to  a participant
  regardless of whether such participant  has been granted a Stock  Appreciation
  Right with respect to the same stock option.

    (e)  In the event of the exercise of a Limited Stock Appreciation Right, the
  number of  shares reserved  for issuance  hereunder shall  be reduced  by  the
  number of shares covered by the stock option or portion thereof surrendered.

  10.  RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  Restricted Stock Awards  will consist of common
shares transferred to participants without other payment therefor as  additional
compensation  for  their services  to the  Company or  any of  its subsidiaries.
Restricted Stock Awards granted under this paragraph 10 shall be satisfied  from
the  Company's  available  treasury  shares. Restricted  Stock  Awards  shall be
subject to such terms  and conditions as  the Committee determines  appropriate,
including,  without limitation, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of
such shares and rights of the Company to reacquire such shares upon  termination
of  the participant's employment within specified periods. Subject to such other
restrictions as are  imposed by the  Committee, the common  shares covered by  a
Restricted  Stock Award granted to a participant who is subject to Section 16 of
the Securities  Exchange Act  of 1934,  as  amended, may  be sold  or  otherwise
disposed  of only after six (6) months from  the grant date of the award (unless
such sale would not affect the exemption under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities  and
Exchange  Commission). No  more than  ten percent (10%)  of the  total number of
shares available for  grant in  any calendar year  may be  issued as  Restricted
Stock Awards under paragraphs 10 and 13 in that year.

  11. PERFORMANCE AWARDS. Performance Awards in the form of Performance Units or
Performance Shares may be granted to any participant in the Program. Performance
Units  shall consist of monetary awards which may  be earned in whole or in part
if the  Company achieves  certain  goals established  by  the Committee  over  a
designated  period of time. Performance Shares shall consist of common shares or
awards denominated in common shares which may  be earned in whole or in part  if
the  Company  achieves  certain  goals  established  by  the  Committee  over  a
designated period of time. The goals established by the Committee shall be based
on any one, or combination of, earnings  per share, return on equity, return  on
assets,  total shareholder return, net operating  income, cash flow, increase in
revenue, economic value added,  increase in share price  or cash flow return  on
investment.  Partial  achievement of  the  goal(s) may  result  in a  payment or
vesting corresponding to the degree of  achievement. Payment of an award  earned
may  be in cash or in common shares or in a combination of both, and may be made
when earned,  or may  be  vested and  deferred, as  the  Committee in  its  sole
discretion  determines.  The  maximum  amount which  may  be  granted  under all
Performance Awards  for any  one year  for  any one  participant shall  be  Five
Million  Dollars ($5,000,000). This limit shall be applied to Performance Shares
by multiplying the number of Performance Shares granted by the fair market value
of one common share on the date of  the award. This paragraph 11 is intended  to
comply with the performance-based compensation requirements of Section 162(m) of
the  Internal Revenue  Code of  1986, as  amended, and  shall be  interpreted in
accordance with the rules and regulations thereunder.

  12. FOREIGN QUALIFIED BENEFITS. Benefits under  the Program may be granted  to
such  employees of the Company and its  subsidiaries who are residing in foreign
jurisdictions as the Committee in its sole discretion may determine from time to
time. The  Committee  may  adopt such  supplements  to  the Program  as  may  be
necessary  to comply with the applicable  laws of such foreign jurisdictions and
to afford participants favorable treatment  under such laws; provided,  however,
that  no  Benefit shall  be  granted under  any  such supplement  with  terms or
conditions which are  inconsistent with the  provisions as set  forth under  the
Program.

  13. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.

    (a)  Each person elected  a Non-Employee Director  at an annual shareholders
  meeting in any of the years 1996 through 2005 shall receive a Restricted Stock
  Award on the dates of their election covering a number of common shares with a
  fair market value on the date of the  award closest to, but not in excess  of,
  Twenty-Two  Thousand Dollars ($22,000)  for awards made  in years 1996 through
  2000 and Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) for awards made in years  2001
  through 2005.

    (b)  ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES. As soon  as practicable following the date of
the  award  the  Company  shall  issue  certificates  ("Certificates")  to   the
Non-Employee  Director receiving  the award,  representing the  number of common
shares covered by the award. Each Certificate shall bear a legend describing the
restrictions on such shares imposed by this paragraph 13.

    (c) RIGHTS. Upon issuance of the Certificates, the directors in whose  names
they  are registered  shall, subject to  the restrictions of  this paragraph 13,
have all of the rights of a  shareholder with respect to the shares  represented
by  the Certificates, including the  right to vote such  shares and receive cash
dividends and other distributions thereon.

    (d) RESTRICTED  PERIOD. The  shares  covered by  awards granted  under  this
paragraph  13 may  not be sold  or otherwise  disposed of within  six (6) months
following their grant  date (unless  such sale  would not  affect the  exemption
under  Rule 16b-3  of the  Securities and  Exchange Commission)  and in addition
shall be subject  to the restrictions  of this  paragraph 13 for  a period  (the
"Restricted  Period") commencing with  the date of  the award and  ending on the
earliest of the following events:

      (i) The date the director terminates or retires from the Board;

      (ii) The date the director dies; or

      (iii) The  date  of occurrence  of  a Change  in  Control (as  defined  in
    paragraph 21(c)).

    (e)  RESTRICTIONS. All shares covered by awards granted under this paragraph
13 shall be subject to the following restrictions during the Restricted Period:

      (i)  The  shares  may  not   be  sold,  assigned,  transferred,   pledged,
    hypothecated or otherwise disposed of.

      (ii)  Any additional common  shares of the Company  or other securities or
    property issued with respect to shares covered by awards granted under  this
    paragraph   13  as  a   result  of  any  stock   dividend,  stock  split  or
    reorganization, shall be subject to the restrictions and other provisions of
    this paragraph 13.

      (iii) A director  shall not  be entitled to  receive any  shares prior  to
    completion  of all actions deemed appropriate  by the Company to comply with
    federal or state securities laws and stock exchange requirements.

    (f) Except in  the event of  conflict, all provisions  of the Program  shall
  apply  to  this  paragraph  13.  In the  event  of  any  conflict  between the
  provisions of  the Program  and this  paragraph 13,  this paragraph  13  shall
  control.  Those provisions  of paragraph 17  which authorize  the Committee to
  declare outstanding  restricted stock  awards to  be vested  and to  amend  or
  modify  the terms  of Benefits  shall not apply  to awards  granted under this
  paragraph 13. Restricted Stock Awards granted under this paragraph 13 shall be
  satisfied from the Company's available treasury shares.

  14. NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.

    (a) Each Non-Employee Director may elect to receive any or all of his or her
  fees earned during the second half  of 1996 and each subsequent calendar  year
  under  Section 3 of  the Abbott Laboratories  Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan
  (the "Directors' Fee Plan") in the  form of Non-qualified Stock Options  under
  this  Section 14. Each such election shall be irrevocable, and must be made in
  writing and filed with the Secretary of the Company by December 31, 1995  (for
  fees  earned in the  second half of  1996) and (for  fees earned in subsequent
  calendar years) by June 30 of the calendar year preceding the calendar year in
  which such fees are  earned (or such  later date as  may be permissible  under
  Rule  16b-3 of the Securities  and Exchange Commission, but  in no event later
  than December 31 of such preceding calendar year).

    (b) A  Non-Employee Director  may file  a new  election each  calendar  year
  applicable  to fees earned in the  immediately succeeding calendar year. If no
  new election or revocation of a prior  election is received by June 30 of  any
  calendar  year (or such later date as may be permissible under paragraph (a)),
  the election,  if any,  in effect  for such  calendar year  shall continue  in
  effect  for the immediately succeeding calendar  year. Any election made under
  this Section 14 shall take precedence  over any election made by the  director
  for the same period, under the Directors' Fee Plan, to the extent necessary to
  resolve  any conflict between such elections. If  a director does not elect to
  receive his or her fees in the  form of Non-qualified Stock Options, the  fees
  due  such director shall be paid or deferred as provided in the Directors' Fee
  Plan and any applicable election thereunder by the director.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                             A-4

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) The number of common shares  covered by each Non-qualified Stock  Option
  granted  in any  year under this  Section 14  shall be determined  based on an
  independent appraisal for such year of the intrinsic value of options  granted
  hereunder  and the amount of fees covered  by the director's election for such
  year. The  number of  common shares  covered by  options granted  in 1996  (as
  determined  under this procedure) shall be the number of whole shares equal to
  (i) the product of three (3) times  the amount of fees which the director  has
  elected  under paragraph  (a) to  receive in  the form  of Non-qualified Stock
  Options, divided by (ii) One Hundred  percent (100%) of the Fair Market  Value
  of  one common  share on  the grant  date. Any  fraction of  a share  shall be
  disregarded, and the remaining amount of the fees corresponding to such option
  shall be  paid as  provided in  the  Directors' Fee  Plan and  any  applicable
  election thereunder by the director.

    (d)  Each Non-qualified  Stock Option due  a director under  this Section 14
  shall be  issued as  of the  date  the corresponding  fees otherwise  due  the
  director  would have been paid under the Directors' Fee Plan and at a purchase
  price equal to  One Hundred percent  (100%) of  the Fair Market  Value of  the
  common shares covered by such option on the grant date. Each such option shall
  be  fully exercisable after six (6) months  from the grant date, and shall not
  be exercisable after  the expiration of  ten (10) years  from the grant  date.
  Each  such option  shall contain provisions  allowing payment  of the purchase
  price, and any taxes due on the  exercise, by delivery of other common  shares
  of  the  Company (or,  in  the case  of payment  of  taxes, by  withholding of
  shares).

  15. NONTRANSFERABILITY. Except as provided by the Committee, each stock option
and  stock  appreciation  right  granted   under  this  Program  shall  not   be
transferable  other than by  will or the  laws of descent  and distribution, and
shall be exercisable, during the participant's lifetime, only by the participant
or the participant's guardian or legal representative.

  16. OTHER PROVISIONS. The award of any  Benefit under the Program may also  be
subject to other provisions (whether or not applicable to the Benefit awarded to
any  other  participant)  as the  Committee  determines  appropriate, including,
without limitation, provisions  for the  purchase of common  shares under  stock
options  in installments,  provisions for the  payment of the  purchase price of
shares under stock  options by delivery  of other common  shares of the  Company
having  a  then  market  value  equal to  the  purchase  price  of  such shares,
restrictions  on  resale  or  other  disposition,  such  provisions  as  may  be
appropriate  to comply with federal or  state securities laws and stock exchange
requirements and understandings or conditions as to the participant's employment
in addition to those specifically provided for under the Program.

  In the case of a participant who is subject to Section 16(a) and 16(b) of  the
Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934, the  Committee  may, at  any time,  add such
conditions and limitations to  any Benefit granted to  such participant, or  any
feature  of any such  Benefit, as the  Committee, in its  sole discretion, deems
necessary or desirable to comply with Section  16(a) or 16(b) and the rules  and
regulations thereunder or to obtain any exemption therefrom.

  A  participant may  pay the  purchase price of  shares under  stock options by
delivery of  a  properly  executed  exercise notice  together  with  a  copy  of
irrevocable  instructions to  a broker  to deliver  promptly to  the Company the
amount of sale or  loan proceeds to  pay the purchase  price. To facilitate  the
foregoing, the Company may enter into agreements for coordinated procedures with
one or more brokerage firms.

  The  Committee may,  in its  discretion and  subject to  such rules  as it may
adopt, permit or require a participant to  pay all or a portion of the  federal,
state  and local taxes, including FICA  and medicare withholding tax, arising in
connection with the following transactions: (a) the exercise of a  Non-qualified
Stock  Option; (b)  the lapse  of restrictions  on common  shares received  as a
Restricted Stock Award; or (c) the receipt or exercise of any other Benefit;  by
(i) having the Company withhold common shares, (ii) tendering back common shares
received  in connection with  such Benefit or  (iii) delivering other previously
acquired common shares of the Company  having a fair market value  approximately
equal to the amount to be withheld.

  The  Committee  may grant  stock  options under  the  Program (and,  for stock
options granted  prior  to  shareholder  approval of  this  Program,  under  the
Company's   1991  Incentive  Stock  Program)  that  provide  for  the  grant  of
replacement stock options if all or any  portion of the purchase price or  taxes
incurred  in connection with the exercise, are paid by delivery (or, in the case
of payment of taxes,  by withholding of  shares) of other  common shares of  the
Company.  The replacement stock  option shall cover the  number of common shares
surrendered to pay the purchase price, plus the number of shares surrendered  or
withheld  to satisfy  the participant's  tax liability,  shall have  an exercise
price equal to  One Hundred  percent (100%)  of the  Fair Market  Value of  such
common  shares on the date such replacement stock option is granted, shall first
be exercisable six months from the date of grant of the replacement stock option
and shall have an expiration date equal  to the expiration date of the  original
stock option.

  17.  TERM OF PROGRAM AND AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR ACCELERATION
OF BENEFITS. The Program shall continue in effect until terminated by the  Board
of  Directors of  the Company,  except that no  Incentive Stock  Option shall be
granted more than ten (10) years after the date of adoption of this Program. The
terms and conditions applicable to any

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A-5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits may at any  time be amended, modified  or canceled by mutual  agreement
between the Committee and the participant or such other persons as may then have
an  interest therein, so long as any amendment or modification does not increase
the number of common shares issuable  under this Program; and provided  further,

    any common shares of the Company would be converted into cash, securities of
    another corporation, or other property, other than a merger or consolidation
    of  the Company in which  holders of common shares  immediately prior to the
    merger have  the  same  proportionate  ownership  of  common  stock  of  the
    surviving corporation or its parent corporation immediately after the merger
    as  immediately before, or (B) to sell or otherwise dispose of substantially

  22. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS.

    (a)  If the  Company shall at  any time  change the number  of issued common
  shares without new consideration to the Company (such as by stock dividends or
  stock splits), the  total number of  shares reserved for  issuance under  this
  Program,  the individual and  aggregate limits described  in paragraph 19, and
  the number of shares covered by each outstanding Benefit shall be adjusted  so
  that  the aggregate consideration payable to the Company and the value of each
  such Benefit shall not be changed. The Committee shall also have the right  to
  provide  for the continuation  of Benefits or  for other equitable adjustments
  after  changes  in  the  Company  or  in  the  common  shares  resulting  from
  reorganization, sale, merger, consolidation, spin-off or similar occurrence.

    (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Program,  and without
  affecting the number of shares otherwise reserved or available hereunder,  the
  Committee  may authorize the issuance or  assumption of Benefits in connection
  with  any  merger,  consolidation,  acquisition  of  property  or  stock,   or
  reorganization upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate.

    (c)  Subject to the six month holding requirements of paragraphs 6, 7, 8(c),
  9(c), 10 and 13(d) but notwithstanding any other provision of this Program  or
  the Prior Programs, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control:

      (i)  All stock  options then outstanding  under this Program  or the Prior
    Programs shall become  fully exercisable  as of the  date of  the Change  in
    Control, whether or not then otherwise exercisable;

      (ii)  All Stock Appreciation Rights  and Limited Stock Appreciation Rights
    then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change
    in Control, whether or not then otherwise exercisable;

      (iii) All  terms  and  conditions  of all  Restricted  Stock  Awards  then
    outstanding  shall  be deemed  satisfied as  of  the date  of the  Change in
    Control; and

      (iv) All Performance Awards then outstanding shall be deemed to have  been
    fully  earned and to be immediately payable, in  cash, as of the date of the
    Change in Control.

  23. AMENDMENT  AND TERMINATION  OF  PROGRAM. The  Board  of Directors  of  the
Company  may amend the Program from time to time or terminate the Program at any
time, but  no  such  action  shall  reduce  the  then  existing  amount  of  any
participant's  Benefit  or adversely  change  the terms  and  conditions thereof
without the participant's consent.  To the extent  required for compliance  with
Rule  16b-3  of the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission,  paragraph 13  of the
Program may not be amended more frequently than once every six months other than
to comport with changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
rules thereunder, and no amendment of the Program shall result in any  Committee
member  losing his or her status as  a "disinterested person" as defined in Rule
16b-3 of the  Securities and Exchange  Commission with respect  to any  employee
benefit plan of the Company or result in the Program or awards thereunder losing
their exempt status under said Rule 16b-3.

  24. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Program was adopted by the Board of Directors of
the  Company on October 13, 1995. The Program and any Benefit granted thereunder
shall be null and void  if shareholder approval is  not obtained by October  12,
1996.
