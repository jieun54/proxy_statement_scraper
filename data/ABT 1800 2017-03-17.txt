The

100 Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on

A YEAR OF STRONG PERFORMANCE AND STRATEGIC SHAPING









In
2016, Abbott achieved its expected financial commitments and operational goals and also continued to shape the company for balance, breadth, and sustainable leadership to ensure
Abbott is in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for future growth. 
 
  




  OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS



 


 Named executive officers overachieved their goals related to earnings per share, net income, return on assets, and free cash flow, while
achieving their goals related to sales at 99.8% or greater. 
 Raised the dividend by approximately 7%, marking Abbott's 93rd consecutive year of dividends paid and the 45th straight year the
dividend has been increased. 
 Returned approximately $2.1 billion to Abbott shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
 Re-invested more than $1.1 billion in Abbott through internal capital spending. 

 
  




  CONTINUED TO STRATEGICALLY SHAPE ABBOTT FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH



 
Over the last several years, Abbott continued to take important strategic steps to shape the company for long-term growth. With the separation of AbbVie in
2013, Abbott created a new, better-balanced Abbott with leading positions in attractive areas of healthcare that are aligned with important global trends. In 2014 and 2015, Abbott made important
internal investments across its businesses in new product development and manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure to strengthen our local presence in some of the fastest growing healthcare
markets in the world, such as India and China. Abbott also reshaped and significantly strengthened its branded generics pharmaceuticals business with the acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin
America and Veropharm in Russia, while also divesting its developed markets pharmaceuticals business. These actions created a leading branded generics business with significant scale and focus in some
of the fastest growing geographies, including India, Latin America, and Russia. 2016 represented another significant year of shaping with the announced acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. On
Jan. 4, 2017, Abbott completed the acquisition, establishing Abbott as a leader in the broad medical device arena and providing expanded opportunities for future growth.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS









In
2016, we received 94% shareholder support for our annual advisory vote on "Say on Pay" demonstrating strong support for our approach to executive compensation. We continue to
evolve our compensation program based upon feedback we receive during our ongoing shareholder outreach, as well as continual review of market practices. The following program changes and pay decisions
demonstrate the direct alignment between the interests of our executive officers and shareholders. 

















 



 RECENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM CHANGES




    
 








 


 



 






      Increased the ROE
target for vesting of performance shares granted in 2016 (after a similar increase for shares granted in 2015)    
 Increased director share ownership guidelines      Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology      Implemented a one-year minimum vesting period for long-term
incentive (LTI) grants
 






      Introduced new long-term
incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period      Increased disclosure related to payouts for both annual and long-term incentives      Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy      Implemented a strengthened recoupment
policy
 




 



 




 



 HIGHLIGHTS OF 2016 PAY DECISIONS




    
 








 


 



 






      Paid bonuses, on average,
at 92% of target despite overachievement of goals related to EPS, net income, cash flow, and return on assets targets and 99.8% achievement on sales target (see page 38)
 







      Granted 2017 LTI awards
that were targeted at the 25th percentile, consistent with lower relative total shareholder returns. Executive officers were awarded an average of 22% less LTI in 2017 than in 2016, with the CEO's LTI award also declining 22%
    
 





 



 




 
  




  KEY FEATURES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM



 
The compensation program for our executive officers includes key features that align the interests of our executive officers with our business strategies and
goals, as well as the interests of our shareholders. The program does not include features that could misalign these interests. 





















 ​
 








 What We Do
 









 What We Don't Do 





​




​


 ​




​



 ​




​


 ​




​


 ​







 
 



 
 Use multiple performance hurdles to determine long-term incentive awards (Relative total shareholder return (TSR), Individual Performance, and ROE target)
 



 
 No tax gross-ups under our executive officer pay program






 
 







 


 








 Benchmark peers with investment profile, operating characteristics, and employment and business markets similar to Abbott
 






 


 









 No guaranteed bonuses



 
 



 
 Align annual incentive payouts to drivers of shareholder value (growth, EPS, etc.)
 



 
 No employment contracts






 ​
 







 


 








 Provide change in control benefits under double-trigger circumstances only
 






 


 









 No change in control agreement for the Chief Executive Officer



 
 



 
 Forfeiture for misconduct provision in equity grants and recoup compensation when warranted
 



 
 No highly leveraged incentive plans that encourage excessive risk taking






 ​
 







 


 








 Require significant share ownership for officers and directors
 






 


 









 No immediate vesting of stock options or restricted stock



 
 



 
 Apply pledging policy for Abbott shares
 



 
 No hedging of Abbott shares






 ​
 






 


 









 Cap incentive award payments
 






 


 









 No discounted stock options

  EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION DECISIONS BASED ON 2016 PERFORMANCE



 
Compensation for executive officers is determined by the Compensation Committee based on Company performance relative to our peer group, executive officer
performance relative to goals, and compensation levels relative to our peer group. Despite the significant positive impact of the closing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition on our stock price
(moving Abbott's relative TSR to the top of our peer group at the time the Compensation Committee awarded bonuses and made LTI awards in 2017) and the
critical importance of the transaction on our long-term strategy, the pay decisions outlined below did not reflect the impact of the acquisition, as it
closed after the end of 2016. Compensation decisions based on 2016 performance were made in February 2017 as follows:


Base salary increases averaged 1.3%. The CEO did not receive an increase; his base salary was
last adjusted in 2010. 
Annual incentive payouts were tied to 2016 operating performanceresults were aligned with our goals and
the payouts reflect that. Average bonus payouts were 92% of target despite overachievement of goals related to EPS, net income, cash flow, and return on assets targets and
99.8% achievement of the sales goal. Individual payouts were aligned with performance and ranged from 10% to 122% of target. 
Long-term incentive awards are tied to longer-term returns to shareholdersresults were low relative to
peers and the awards reflect that. The value of 2017 LTI awards was targeted at the 25th percentile of our peer group, consistent with lower relative total shareholder
returns through 2016. Individual awards were aligned with individual performance and ranged from the 5th to the 51st percentile. On average, the value of 2017 LTI grants that were
awarded to executive officers was 22% less than the value of the 2016 grants, with the CEO receiving 22% less as well. If we had granted at the 50th percentile instead of the 25th, the grant
guidelines would have been approximately $2 million higher for the CEO and $650,000 higher for each of the other NEOs. 

The
impact of these pay decisions on our CEO's compensation is shown in the table below:

It
is important to note that the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table (page 44) reflect the annual bonus for 2016 performance, but the LTI awards shown are for 2015 performance. Due
to the significantly different LTI amounts granted in 2017 (using the 25th percentile guidelines) vs. 2016 (using the 50th percentile guidelines), we have disclosed the
2017 grant in this proxy to aid shareholders in their understanding of our approach to compensation which definitively aligns our LTI grant guidelines with relative TSR (as outlined on
page 35).

  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING



 
 
  


WHO CAN VOTE



 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2017 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of
January 31, 2017, Abbott had 1,727,997,596 outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of
directors and one vote per share on all other matters. 
 
  


NOTICE AND ACCESS



 
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Notice and Access" rules, Abbott mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the
"Notice") to certain shareholders in mid-March of 2017. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how the shareholders can access the proxy materials online. It also
provides instructions on how those shareholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a print version of the proxy materials, unless you request one. If you would
like to receive a print version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
 
  


CUMULATIVE VOTING



 
Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee
or distribute the votes among the nominees, as the shareholder desires. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes against a nominee. If shares are voted cumulatively and there are more nominees than
there are director vacancies, nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
 
  


VOTING BY PROXY



 
All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. Abbott's By-Laws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as
proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return
your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found with your proxy card or on the Notice. 
 
  


REVOKING A PROXY



 
You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting:


 by delivering a written notice to the Secretary of Abbott, 
 by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
 by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 

 
  


DISCRETIONARY VOTING AUTHORITY



 
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they
receive to elect the 11 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the Board of Directors,
or for fewer than 11 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively in their sole
discretion so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. The proxy holders may not cast
your vote for any nominee from whom you have withheld authority to vote. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive
compensation, the advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, the approval of the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, the approval of the Abbott
Laboratories Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees, 
​
10      Abbott
Laboratories



 
Table of Contents
or
the approval of a shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has
been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, FOR an annual (1 year) shareholder
advisory vote on executive compensation, FOR the approval of the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, FOR the approval of the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for
Non-U.S. Employees, and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
The
Board of Directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted
in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 



QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH ITEM ON THE PROXY




A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at
the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 



EFFECT OF WITHHOLD VOTES, BROKER NON-VOTES, AND ABSTENTIONS




Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to withhold authority to vote for one or more
directors or to abstain from voting on another matter will have the effect of votes against those directors or that matter. A proxy submitted by an institution, such as a broker or bank that holds
shares for the account of a beneficial owner, may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for
example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not
present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks
have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do
not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors and the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation are
"non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. 
 
  


INSPECTORS OF ELECTION



 
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott
employees. 
 
  


COST OF SOLICITING PROXIES



 
Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
  


ABBOTT LABORATORIES STOCK RETIREMENT PLAN



 
Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive voting instructions for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock
Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust is administered by both a trustee and an Investment Committee. The trustee of the Trust is The Northern Trust Company. The members of the Investment
Committee are Stephen R. Fussell, Karen M. Peterson, and Brian P. Wentworth, employees of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the Investment
Committee and the participants. The Investment Committee must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The Investment Committee may use its own
discretion with respect to those shares for which no voting instructions are received.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING



 
It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be
disclosed, except:


 where disclosure may be required by law or regulation, 
 where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims, 
 where a shareholder provides comments with a proxy, 
 where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, 
 to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or 
 in other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the Board of Directors. 

 
  


HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS



 
Shareholders sharing an address may receive only one copy of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, unless their
broker, bank, or other intermediary has received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This is known as "householding." Shareholders wishing to discontinue householding and
receive separate copies of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials should notify their broker, bank, or other intermediary.

  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES



 
 









THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS









The
Board of Directors held 11 meetings in 2016. The average attendance of all directors at Board and committee meetings in 2016 was ninety-five percent and each director
attended at least seventy-five percent of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. Abbott encourages its Board members to attend the annual
shareholders meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern,
R. S. Austin, S. E. Blount, W. J. Farrell, E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn,
S. C. Scott III, D. J. Starks, and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the Board applied the categorical
standards attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The Board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that
none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or
entities to which Abbott sold products or made contributions or from which Abbott purchased products and services during the year. In making its determination, the Board relied on both information
provided by the directors and information developed internally by Abbott. 
The
Board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. 
 









LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE










The
Board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by one individual and an independent director
acts as lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all Board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of Abbott
and its shareholders. 




Chairman/Chief Executive Officer  


 Coherent leadership and direction for the Board and executive management 
 Clear accountability and a single focus for the chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans  
 CEO's extensive industry expertise, leadership experience, and familiarity with our business 
 By leading management and chairing the Board, we benefit from our CEO's strategic and operational insights, enabling a focused vision
encompassing the full range, from long-term strategic direction to day-to-day execution 





Lead Independent Director  


 Currently, the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee acts as the lead director 
 Chosen by and from the independent members of the Board of Directors, and serves as the liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the
independent directors 
 Facilitates communication with the Board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions
where the Chairman of the Board is not present 
 Reviews and approves matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other Board members  
 Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors and, if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he or she is available
for consultation and direct communication 
 The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer regarding appropriate
agenda topics and other Board related matters

DIRECTOR SELECTION









The
Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board the nominees for
election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The process used by the Nominations and Governance Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors
depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. 
Abbott's
outline of directorship qualifications, which as part of Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). These qualifications describe specific characteristics that the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board take into
consideration when selecting nominees for the Board, such as: strong management experience and senior level experience in medicine, hospital administration, medical and scientific research and
development, finance, international business, government, and academic administration. An individual nominee is not required to satisfy all the characteristics listed in the outline of directorship
qualifications and there is no requirement that all such characteristics be represented on the Board. 
In
addition, Board members should have backgrounds that, when combined, provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Board candidates will
be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence, and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a
global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the Board of Directors' oversight role with
respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the Board to conclude that the director should serve on the Board.
The directors' biographies are on pages 13 through 18. 
A
description of the procedure for the recommendation and nomination of directors, including by proxy access, is on page 86. 
 









BOARD DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION









In
the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Nominations and Governance Committee considers the Board's diversity of relevant
experience, areas of expertise, ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. Fifty percent of the independent directors nominated for
election are women or minorities. 
The
process used to identify and select nominees has resulted in an experienced, diverse, and well-rounded Board of Directors that possesses the skills and perspectives necessary for its oversight
role. All of Abbott's directors exhibit: 















      Global business
perspective      Knowledge of
corporate governance requirements and practices
 


      Successful track record
     High
integrity
 


      Innovative thinking
     Commitment to good
corporate citizenship

*Each
of the committee members is financially literate, as is required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. The Board of Directors has determined
that Roxanne S. Austin, the Audit Committee's Chair, is an "audit committee financial expert."
**Mr. Starks
joined the Board of Directors in February 2017.  





Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial reporting
practices and the audit process; the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements; the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance; the performance of Abbott's
internal audit function and internal auditors; and certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. The Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the report of the Audit Committee is on
page 62. 




Compensation Committee  
The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in carrying out the Board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive
officers and directors. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the Board and gives its recommendations to
the full Board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director
compensation, the Compensation Committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. 
This
Committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate
the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent 
​

Table of Contents
with
applicable law or regulation or with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are
described in the section of the proxy captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The
Compensation Committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain, and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The Committee engaged Meridian as its compensation
consultant for 2016. Meridian performs no other work for Abbott. The Committee engages compensation consultants to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation
matters. The consultant and its principal report directly to the Chair of the Committee. The principal meets regularly and as needed with the Committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the
Chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The Committee determines what variables it will instruct the consultant to consider, and they
include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the
marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The Committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to the consultant for these services. Based on its evaluation of Meridian's
independence in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and information provided by Meridian, the Committee determined that the work performed by Meridian does not present any
conflicts of interest. A copy of the Compensation Committee report is on page 41. 




Nominations and Governance Committee  
The Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the
Board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders; recommends to the Board the people to be elected as executive officers of Abbott; develops and recommends to
the Board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to Abbott; and serves in an advisory capacity to the Board and the Chairman of the Board on matters of organization, management succession
plans, major changes in the organizational structure of Abbott, and the conduct of Board activities. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The process used by this Committee to identify a
nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying
individuals qualified to be Board members. The process used by the Committee to identify nominees is described on page 20 in the section captioned, "Director Selection." 




Public Policy Committee  
The Public Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain areas of
legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott. The Committee is governed by a written charter. 




Executive Committee  
The Executive Committee may exercise all the authority of the Board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for Board
action. 
 









COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS










Interested
parties may communicate with the Board of Directors by writing a letter to the Chairman of the Board, to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee, who acts
as the lead director at the meetings of the independent directors, or to the independent directors c/o Abbott Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, D-364, AP6D, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-6400,
Attention: Corporate Secretary. The General Counsel and Corporate Secretary regularly forwards to the addressee all letters other than mass mailings, advertisements, and other materials not relevant
to Abbott's business. In addition, directors regularly receive a log of all correspondence received by the Company that is addressed to a member of the Board and may request any correspondence on that
log. 
 









CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATERIALS









Abbott's
corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, director independence standards, code of business conduct, and the charters of Abbott's Audit
Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominations and Governance Committee, and Public Policy Committee are all available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website

(1)Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $10,500 for each month of service as a director. Audit
Committee members, other than the Audit Committee chair, receive $500 for each month of service on the Audit Committee. Prior to May 1, 2016, a chairman of a Board committee (other than the
Audit Committee) received $1,000 for each month of service as chairman of a board committee and the chairman of the Audit Committee received $1,500 for each month of service as chairman of that
committee. Effective as of May 1, 2016, the monthly fees for Board committee chairmen became: $2,083.33 for the Audit Committee chairman, $1,666.66 for the Compensation Committee chairman,
$1,250.00 for the Public Policy Committee chairman, and $1,250.00 for the chairman of any other Board committee. In addition, the lead director earns $2,500 for each month of such service and does not
receive a fee for service as Nominations and Governance Committee chairman. Fees earned under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the
form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust
established by the director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon retirement from the Board of
Directors, if later. The director may elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to either a guaranteed interest account or to a stock equivalent account that earns the same
return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less
than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related common stock at year-end.
(2)The
amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an
Abbott common share on the date of grant. In addition to the fees described in footnote 1, each non-employee director elected to the Board of Directors at the annual shareholders meeting receives
vested restricted stock units having a value of $150,000 (rounded down) under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program. In 2016, this was 3,799 units. The non-employee directors receive
cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the units at the same rate as other shareholders. Upon termination, retirement from the Board, death, or a change in control of
Abbott, a non-employee director will receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. The following

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



 
 









COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS









 
  




  INTRODUCTION



 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes Abbott's executive compensation program in 2016. While the Summary Compensation Table on
page 44 provides the required disclosures for this proxy statement, we will also discuss the LTI grant made in February 2017, since that grant was based on 2016 performance. The LTI grant
disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table was made in February 2016 and was based on 2015 performance. 
In
particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and Board of Directors made its compensation decisions for the Company's executives, including the five named officers:
Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration; Brian B. Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief
Financial Officer; Brian J. Blaser, Executive Vice President, Diagnostic Products; and Michael J. Warmuth, Executive Vice President, Established Pharmaceuticals. Mr. Freyman has retired. 
The
CD&A also describes the pay philosophy the Committee has established for the Company's executive officers, the process the Committee utilizes to examine performance in the context of executive pay
decisions, the performance goals and results for each named officer, and recent updates to our compensation program. 
 
  




  2016 PERFORMANCE



 
In 2016, Abbott achieved its financial commitments and operational goals and continued to shape the company for balance, breadth, and sustainable leadership
to ensure we are in the right businesses that provide the best opportunities for future growth. 
Abbott
achieved the financial commitments and operational goals set forth at the beginning of the year:


 Named executive officers overacheived their goals related to EPS, net income, return on assets, and free cash flow, while achieving their goals
related to sales at 99.8% or greater. 
 Raised the dividend by nearly 7%, marking Abbott's 93rd consecutive year of dividends paid and the
45th straight year the dividend has been increased. 
 Returned approximately $2.1 billion to Abbott shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
 Re-invested more than $1.1 billion in Abbott through internal capital spending. 

Abbott
also initiated two major strategic decisions in 2016 to shape the company for maximum competitiveness with the divestment of Abbott Medical Optics and the acquisition of St. Jude
Medical, which caps an almost 20-year
process through which we have deliberately built one of the world's premier cardiac care businesses, as well as broad-based medical device leadership. 
Despite
the strong operational results and important strategic actions in 2016, Abbott's returns to shareholders on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis were in the lower quartile relative to our peers.
Consistent with Abbott's philosophy to align compensation with performance, these relatively lower total shareholder returns resulted in significantly below market long-term incentive grants for 2017.

  PAY DECISIONS BASED ON 2016 PERFORMANCE



 
In February 2017, our Compensation Committee made pay decisions for our executive officers based on the design of our programs and our performance in 2016.
Despite the significant positive impact of the closing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition on our stock price (moving Abbott's relative TSR to the  top of our peer group at the time the Compensation
Committee awarded bonuses and made LTI awards in 2017) and the critical importance of the transaction
on our long-term strategy, the pay decisions outlined below did not reflect the impact
of the acquisition, as it closed after the end of 2016. The results of those pay decisions were as follows:


 Base salary increases averaged 1.3%. The CEO did not receive an increase; his base salary was last adjusted in 2010.  
 Average bonus payouts were 92% of target despite overachievement of goals related to EPS, net income, cash flow, and return on assets targets
and 99.8% achievement of the sales target. Individual payouts were aligned with individual performance and ranged from 10% to 122% of target. 
 The value of 2017 LTI awards was targeted at the 25th percentile of our peer group, consistent with lower relative total shareholder
returns through 2016. Individual awards were aligned with individual performance and ranged from the 5th to the 51st percentile. On average, the value of 2017 LTI grants that were
awarded to executive officers was 22% less than the value of the 2016 grants, with the CEO receiving 22% less as well. If we had granted at the 50th percentile instead of the 25th, the grant
guidelines would have been approximately $2 million higher for the CEO and $650,000 higher for each of the other NEOs. 

It
is important to note that the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table (page 44) reflect the annual bonus for 2016 performance, but the LTI awards shown are for 2015 performance. Due
to the significantly different LTI amounts granted in 2017 (using the 25th percentile guidelines) vs. 2016 (using the 50th percentile guidelines), we have disclosed the 2017 grant
in this proxy to aid shareholders in their understanding of our approach to compensation which definitively aligns our LTI grant guidelines with relative TSR (as outlined on page 35).

COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPONENTS OF PAY









Abbott
and its Compensation Committee have designed a compensation program to attract and retain executives whose talent and contributions support and advance the profitable growth
of the Company and growth in shareholder value. The program is designed to be:


Competitive: While we target competitive total compensation, actual payouts vary based upon
Company and individual performance. The Compensation Committee sets LTI awards based on relative Company performance. Each year, we look at LTI market percentiles between the
10th and the 90th to determine appropriate award levels. Actual pay reflects actual performance relative to peers. 
Aligned to our shareholders' interests: Almost two-thirds of our pay is equity-based, directly
tying a significant portion of executive compensation to shareholder returns. 
Performance-based: Other than base salary, which is the smallest component of our executives'
compensation, all remaining components of Total Direct Compensation (i.e., annual cash incentive, performance-based restricted stock awards, and stock options) are aligned with Company and/or
division performance. 
Balanced: Short- and long-term objectives focus our executives on actions that create value
today while building for sustainable future success. Our compensation program rewards the achievement of short-term goals and milestones that will accelerate our success over the long-range plan.  



 Annual incentive payouts are tied to current year operating performance vs. goals  
 Long-term incentive awards are tied to longer-term returns to shareholders relative to peers
and sustained performance

CHANGES BASED ON SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK AND MARKET PRACTICES









Last
year, 94% of our shareholders approved the compensation of our named executive officers. During 2016, we conducted outreach with a cross-section of shareholders representing
more than 40% of our outstanding shares. In those meetings, we discussed our pay programs broadly, including aspects that were previously subject to shareholder resolutions. Based on shareholder
discussions and recommendations, the Committee, during its annual evaluation of the Company's compensation programs and evolving market practices, made several changes to our programs. 



















   



 RECENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CHANGES
    




 








 


 



 






      Increased the ROE
target for vesting of performance shares granted in 2016 (after a similar increase for performance shares granted in 2015)   
  Increased director share ownership guidelines      Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology
     Implemented a one-year
minimum vesting period for long-term incentive grants
 






      Introduced new long-term
incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period      Increased disclosure related to payouts for both annual and long-term incentives      Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy      Implemented a strengthened recoupment
policy
    
 




 



 




These
recent changes continue our practice of evolving our program based upon shareholder feedback as well as a review of market practices. Over the past several years, we have made numerous other
changes to our program, including:


 Using three performance assessments to determine the amount of equity awards:



 Relative TSR (compared to peer companies)Determines, as an aggregate target, where our equity grant guidelines should be
positioned relative to the market 
 Individual performanceDetermines individual officer awards based on equity grant guidelines (grant guideline x individual
performance factor) 
 The ROE targetEnsures that performance has been sustained before awards vest 


 Granting equity awards with double-trigger vesting in the event of a change in control 
 Eliminating tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Engaging a Compensation Committee consultant that performs no other work for Abbott 
 Adding a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met 
 Revising executive share ownership guidelines:



 Chief Executive Officer6 times base salary 
 Executive Vice President/Senior Vice President3 times base salary 
 All other officers2 times base salary

HOW EXECUTIVE PAY DECISIONS ARE MADE









The
Committee makes compensation decisions in the context of the objectives of our program. The Committee ensures the compensation delivered to our executives is competitive, based
on performance, balanced between the short- and long-term, aligned with shareholder interests, and does not encourage excessive risk-taking. 
 
  




  BENCHMARKING USING PEER COMPANIES



 
To determine the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, the Committee, in consultation with its independent consultant, annually compares
the level of compensation, market pay practices, and our relative performance to those of peer companies. 
Our
shareholders compare us to other global multinational companies, not necessarily in healthcare. These companies share similar characteristics aligned with our investment identity of diversified
growth and returns to shareholders. 
Our
peer group was selected to strike the appropriate balance between size (both revenues and market capitalization), return profiles, geographic breadth, and management and operating structure. The
peer group purposely includes companies that are outside the healthcare industry. 
In
selecting our peer group for performance and compensation benchmarking, we considered:


 Globally diverse manufacturing-driven organizations with significant international operations 
 Consumer-facing organizations 
 Similar financial and operating measures, including market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees  
 Similar return of cash profiles, including dividends and share repurchases 
 Similar geographic mix of revenues and profits 

In
2016, the Committee reviewed the peer group with its consultant and reaffirmed that these companies continue to represent an appropriate peer group. This group has been overwhelmingly supported by
our investors during shareholder outreach.

  FIXED PAYBASE SALARY



 
Base salary targets are set using the median of the peer group as an initial benchmark. Specific pay rates are based on an executive's performance,
experience, contribution, unique skills, and internal equity with others at Abbott. Base salaries range from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the peer
group, depending on experience, expertise, unique role requirements, and tenure. The average base salary of our executive officers was approximately at the market median. Once the rate of pay is set
at the time of hire or upon promotion, subsequent changes in pay, including salary increases, are based on the executive's performance, the job he or she is performing, internal equity, and the
Company's operating budget. 
 
  




  PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY



 
Abbott's primary performance-based compensation programs for executive officers are the annual cash incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan. These
plans are described in more detail on the following pages. It is important to note that the annual and long-term incentive performance measures differ both in terms of the
measures and the period over which results are assessed. However, both plans are formula-driven based on specific operating, strategic, and leadership results. 
​

  ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN (PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN)



 
Our annual cash incentive plan is a key part of our officers' total compensation. It rewards executives for achieving specific annual goals at the corporate
and divisional levels. It also rewards executives for achieving operational and strategic goals. 
During
2016, Abbott's five named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. 




Annual Cash Incentives Are Capped  
Each year, the Committee sets the maximum award allocations under the PIP for each named officer as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2016, the
maximum award for the Chief Executive Officer was 0.15% of adjusted consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year-end and, for all of the other named officers, 0.075% of adjusted consolidated net
earnings. Historically and in 2016, the Committee exercised its discretion to deliver PIP awards that were substantially below the maximum awards that are authorized by these formulas based on
achieved performance against annual goals and other factors described below. 




Process to Determine Awards  
Under the PIP, the Committee sets a target payout (expressed as a percentage of base salary) for each officer based upon market benchmarks and internal
equity. The final payout is determined based upon operating performance relative to annual goals. This process is described below. In 2016, annual incentive payouts for Abbott's executive officers
ranged from 10% to 122% of target, with an average of 92% of target. 


 Step One: Fund Annual Incentive Pool Based on EPS
Achievement 
In
order for the PIP to pay out, the EPS goal (see 2016 Performance Goals for Performance Incentive Plan on page 38) must be achieved. If the EPS goal is not achieved, then
the PIP is not funded and there are no payouts. 


Step Two: Assess Individual Performance vs. Goals 
Individual
goals are finalized at the beginning of each year based upon each executive officer's responsibilities. The weighting of goals depends upon whether the executive is a
Business Unit leader or a Corporate leader, as follows:

Financial
return performance required to earn payouts above 100% of target varies by business to reflect each business's market and operating environment. 
Strategic Initiative GoalsStrategic initiative goals are primarily related to key planned strategic actions, such as portfolio expansion,
key R&D milestones, gross margin expansion, and entry into new markets. Strategic goals are set such that fully successful achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout with no additional upside.
Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0% of target. 
Leadership GoalsLeadership goals are primarily related to talent and succession planning initiatives. These goals are focused on
stabilizing business leadership gaps, ensuring businesses have the talent they need to perform in the current period, and building our leadership bench to sustain our performance. Leadership goals are
set such that fully successful achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout with no additional upside. Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0% of target.

Based
on performance against goals, 2016 cash incentive payouts ranged from the 5th percentile to the 90th percentile of our peer group. The average 2016 cash
incentive payout for our executive officers was at the 60th percentile of our peer group. 
 
  




  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTI)



 
Our long-term incentive plan is the largest component of our executive officers' total compensation. As such, we believe it is critical that LTI performance
goals reflect Company and individual performance, on both an absolute and relative basis. The LTI process used in February 2016 (described below) resulted in annual grants to executive officers
ranging from the 30th percentile to the 68th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 48th percentile. A preview of the
February 2017 grant (which will be disclosed in our 2018 Summary Compensation table) is also described below. 




Process to Determine Awards  
Our process for determining guidelines, individual awards, and vesting of those awards incorporates:


 TSR performance relative to our peers on a one-, three-, and five-year basis  Individual officer achievement of three-year sales,
profitability, and strategic goals  Each officer's performance relative to other officers 

This
process is far more rigorous than automatically granting LTI at the median of the market and adjusting the awards only for relative TSR at the end of the performance cycle to determine the extent
to which awards vest. 
We
followed a rigorous two-stage process to determine the size of LTI awards ultimately granted to our executive officers: 
Stage
One: Determine LTI Awards
Stage Two: Determine if Options and Shares Vest 
​
34      Abbott
Laboratories
​



 


Stage One: Determine LTI Awards 
In order to determine LTI awards, Abbott follows three steps. 
Step ACompany LTI Award GuidelinesAbbott obtains survey data annually to assess the competitive LTI market for our peer group
companies for each executive position. Each year, we position our LTI award guidelines relative to the competitive LTI market by comparing Abbott's TSR performance to our peers.  While most of our peer companies simply set
their annual LTI level at the 50th percentile of market, the following chart shows definitively how we adjust
our LTI grant guidelines to align with our relative TSR performance. For example, grants made in February 2017 were granted at the 25th percentile of our peer group as illustrated
in the 2016 Performance Year consistent with our relatively lower TSR vs. peers. These grants will be disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

Step BDetermine Individual Officer AwardsThe recommendation for each officer starts with the Company LTI
award guideline (based on relative TSR performance as described above) for the officer's position, as established in Step A. Individual officer awards are then further adjusted up or down based upon
assessment of their achievement of individual goals related to  


1)Three
Year Sales and Market Growth  2)Three
Year Margin Contribution  3)Three
Year Strategic Milestones 

Each
officer is assigned an overall score based on whether they missed, achieved, or exceeded the specific targets in all three measures for all three years. That resulting assessment score determines
the LTI performance adjustment. 
Awards
granted in 2016, based on individual officer performance in 2015, resulted in awards ranging from 75% to 125% of guideline award levels, with an average of 100% of guideline. These awards
combined with the 50th percentile guidelines resulted in annual grants to Abbott executive officers ranging from the 30th percentile to the
68th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 48th percentile. 
Awards
granted in 2017, based on individual officer performance in 2016, resulted in awards ranging from 26% to 135% of guideline award levels, with an average of 98% of guideline. These awards
combined with the 25th percentile guidelines resulted in annual grants to Abbott executive officers ranging from the 5th percentile to the
51st percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 27th percentile. 
Step CConvert Individual LTI Award Values to Equity GrantsIn 2016, to recognize the continued growth focus of Abbott and to
directly align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, the Compensation Committee granted the long-term incentive awards in the form of 50% stock options and 50%
performance-restricted shares. This mix is consistent with the practices of our peer group and was continued for our grants in 2017. 


Stage Two: Determine if Options and Shares Vest 
Stock options vest over three years. Since stock options only accrue value through share price appreciation, the value realized upon the exercise of vested
stock options directly aligns the compensation earned with the value shareholders received over the same period of time. Options are also aligned with shareholder value through the impact of relative
TSR in determining the size of awards granted (Stage One). 
Performance-restricted
shares vest 1/3 each year that the performance target is achieved. Vesting is absoluteeither 100% or 0%. There is no partial vesting if the target is
missed or additional vesting upside if the Company over-performs. The Committee believes adjusted return on equity (ROE) is the appropriate performance measure for vesting because ROE measures how
much profit the Company generates over the long-term with the capital that shareholders have invested.

​




 









Although Company TSR performance and individual officer performance are used in Stage One to grant the appropriate award level, the focus on ROE for vesting
provides a second shareholder protection to ensure our growth and investment return objectives are sustained after the initial grant is made. ROE is only used for vesting; it is not used in the
determination of LTI award guidelines or individual officer performance. 











In 2016, the ROE vesting target to determine future vesting was increased from 11% to 12%. This increase is after a similar increase from 10% to 11% for grants made in 2015. This is consistent with our stated intent to
increase our ROE and ROE targets over time. Prior to the separation of Abbott and AbbVie, the AbbVie business accounted for the majority (65%) of Abbott's adjusted net income. However, at the separation of AbbVie, Abbott retained the majority (90%)
of the equity, which has resulted in lower than average ROE for Abbott since that time. (There was a similar impact on other rate of return measures, including Return on Assets.) For a reconciliation of adjusted net income to GAAP, see
Annex I.

  PAY DECISIONS FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



 
The following pages highlight the rationale for the pay decisions for each named officer. It is important to note that annual
incentive pay decisions were made in early 2017 based on 2016 results. Long-term incentive decisions (options and performance shares) shown in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement
were made in early 2016 based on 2015 results (see prior year proxy statement for discussion of 2015 results). We have also included information about our February 2017 LTI grants since they were
based on 2016 TSR performance and were significantly lower than those made in 2016. Specific 2016 financial goals are detailed on page 38.
Despite the significant positive impact of the closing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition on our stock price (moving Abbott's relative TSR to the
top of our peer group at the time the Compensation Committee awarded bonuses and made LTI awards in 2017) and the critical importance of the transaction on our long-term
strategy, the pay decisions outlined below did not reflect the impact of the acquisition, as it closed after the end of 2016.




Miles D. White  
Base SalaryNo increase. 
Performance
Incentive PlanMr. White's target bonus is 175% of base salary, which is equal to the median of our peer group (appropriate given his long
and successful tenure). Based on performance in 2016, Mr. White received a bonus in February 2017 of $3,200,000, which was equal to 96% of his target bonus. This payout reflects his goal

  BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES



 
Each of the benefits described below was designed to support the Company's objective of providing a competitive total pay program. Individual benefits do not
directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. 















 



 




 



 Benefits and Perquisites 







 Description 







 ​


 
 

 
 

 
 

 


 
 
 Retirement Benefits
 
The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are described in greater
detail in the "Pension Benefits" section of the proxy.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Since officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust,
officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax
withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the officers' actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8%) while they are employed. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are
not tax deferred.
 

 


 
 
 
 
 Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon
retirement from the Company generally follows the manner elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse, depending upon the pension distribution method elected by the officer under the Annuity
Retirement Plan) live beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit and, therefore, exhaust the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid by the Company.
 
 





​




​


​




​


​




​



​






 
 
 Deferred Compensation
 
 Officers of the Company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary, on a pre-tax basis, to the Company's
qualified 401(k) plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18% of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan. Unlike other U.S. managers, officers are not eligible to
elect to defer compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan. However, one hundred percent (100%) of annual incentive awards earned under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan is eligible for deferral to a non-qualified plan. Officers may defer
these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Officers do
not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the Company.
 






​




​


​




​


​




​



​






 
 
 Change in Control Arrangements
 
 Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement. The other named officers have change in control agreements, the purpose of which
is to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the Company, and protect the earned benefits of the officer against adverse changes
resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to the Committee by its independent compensation consultant. These
arrangements are described in greater detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.

 Financial Planning
 
 Named officers are eligible to receive up to $10,000 of fees annually associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation, and general financial
planning. If an officer chooses to utilize this benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation are paid by the Company and are treated as imputed income to the officer, who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due on the fees
paid by the Company.
 
 





​




​


​




​


​




​



​






 
 
 Company Automobile
 
 Named officers are eligible for use of a Company-leased vehicle, with a lease term of 50 months. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost
of the vehicle is imputed to the officer as income for federal income tax purposes.
 






​




​



​




​


​




​


​






 
 
 Company Aircraft
 
 Non-business-related flights on corporate aircraft by Messrs. White and Freyman are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant
to which incremental costs associated with those flights are reimbursed by the executives to the Company in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.
 






​




​


​




​


​




​



​






 
 
 Disability Benefit
 
 In addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, the named officers are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is
described in greater detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.

  SHARE OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION GUIDELINES



 
To further promote sustained shareholder return and to ensure the Company's executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives, the Company has
established share ownership guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the position.

All
named officers with 5 years' tenure in their current position meet or exceed the guidelines. 
 
  




  HEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from entering into or engaging in any financial transaction that is designed to reduce the financial risk associated
with owning Abbott stock. These financial transactions include, but are not limited to, engaging in short sales, derivative transactions (such as equity swaps, straddles, puts, or calls), and hedging
or monetizing transactions (such as collars, exchange funds, or prepaid forward variable contracts) that are linked directly to Abbott stock. 
 
  




  PLEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from holding Abbott stock in a margin account, pledging Abbott stock, or otherwise securing any of their obligations by
assigning Abbott stock as collateral. The Compensation Committee, or its delegate, may grant an exception provided that:


 The director or officer meets Abbott's applicable minimum stock ownership guideline; and 
 Only Abbott stock in excess of the applicable minimum stock ownership guideline is held in the margin account, pledged, or assigned as
collateral.

  RECOUPMENT POLICY



 
In 2015, following discussions by management with shareholders, the Compensation Committee implemented a recoupment policy. The Compensation Committee has
broad discretion to administer and implement the policy and seek recoupment of equity or cash incentive awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory
capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that causes significant financial harm to Abbott. The Compensation Committee may recover incentive compensation awarded to a senior
executive in the prior three years or reduce future awards. The policy will not affect awards made prior to its effective date or following a change in control. 
 
  




  COMPLIANCE



 
The Committee considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and reserves the flexibility to take
actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and
flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, Abbott may provide compensation that is not deductible.
See the section captioned "Plan Summary" on page 67 for more information about Code Section 162(m). 
 









COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT









The
Compensation Committee of the Board is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving, and overseeing Abbott's compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the
Committee's independent consultant to establish Abbott's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with
management and has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT









During 2016, Abbott conducted its annual risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for employees and executives. Abbott's risk assessment is
reinforced by Abbott's adherence to a number of industry-leading best practices, including: 














 
Compensation Committee chaired by independent, non-employee director





 
Representation from the Audit Committee on the Compensation Committee





 
Review of executive compensation programs by the Compensation Committee's independent consultant





 
Robust review of compensation program elements and key performance drivers





 
Detailed measurement of short- and long-term compensation elements to ensure balance





 
Incorporation of multiple program requirements that mitigate excessive risk-taking (e.g., recoupment policy, stock ownership guidelines)




Based on this assessment, Abbott determined its compensation and benefit programs appropriately align employees compensation and performance without incentivizing risky behaviors. Any
risk arising from its compensation policies and practices is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Abbott or its shareholders. 
The following factors were among those considered:


Regular training on code of business conduct and policies and procedures is mandatory for all employees and non-employee
directors. 
Compensation structure encourages employees to regard Abbott as a career employer, to consider the long-term impact of their
decisions, and to align their interests with those of Abbott's shareholders (e.g., equity awards that vest over multi-year periods, defined benefit pension plan).  
Annual benchmarking ensures performance achievement and incentive payout opportunities that are aligned with a peer group that
reflects the size, investment profile, operating characteristics, and employment and business markets of Abbott. Appropriateness of this group is assessed annually by the Compensation Committee's
independent consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee. 
Abbott's annual incentive plan places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other factors,
including operational and strategic measures. Since earnings are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of Abbott's compensation plan promotes alignment with shareholder interests
without creating duplication across incentive plans. 
Abbott's long-term incentive plan focuses on longer-term operating performance and shareholder returns, (e.g., in 2016,
roughly 67% of CEO and 66% of other named officer total compensation was in the form of long-term equity incentives that can be earned or vest over multiple years). 

​

Table of Contents


Equity awards are made, and grant prices are set at the same time each year, at the Compensation Committee's regularly
scheduled meeting. In addition, Abbott does not reprice stock options, award discounted stock options, or immediately vest stock options or restricted stock. The equity awards are based on multiple
performance factors. Both executive and Director share ownership guidelines and share retention requirements promote alignment with shareholders.  
Abbott's compensation program does not include features that could encourage excessive risk taking, such as over-weighting
toward annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, uncapped incentive award payments, unreasonable thresholds, or steep payout cliffs at certain levels that may encourage short-term business
decisions to meet payout thresholds. 
Abbott's recoupment policy allows the Compensation Committee to seek recoupment of incentive compensation or reduce future
awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that caused significant financial
harm to Abbott. 
Abbott's hedging policy prohibits directors and officers from entering into financial transactions designed to reduce the
financial risk associated with owning Abbott shares. 
Abbott's pledging policy prohibits directors and officers from holding Abbott shares in a margin account, pledging Abbott
shares, or securing obligations by assigning Abbott shares as collateral unless granted an exception by the Compensation Committee. 

This assessment was discussed with the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant. The Committee and the consultant both agreed with the
assessment.

(1)Mr.
Freyman has retired.
(2)In
a typical year, such as 2016 and 2015, Abbott's U.S. salaried employees are paid on a bi-weekly 26 pay period schedule. 2014 included an extra pay
period for Abbott's U.S. salaried employees, resulting in salaries approximately 3.8 percent higher than in a typical year having 26 pay periods.
(3)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the
awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines grant date fair value by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and
low market prices of an Abbott common share on the award's date of grant.
(4)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the
awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model.
These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined
using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. For options other than the replacement options, the assumptions are the
same as those described in Note 9, entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data" in Abbott's 2016 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.
(5)This
compensation is earned as a performance-based incentive bonus, pursuant to the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan. Additional
information regarding the Performance Incentive Plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeAnnual Cash Incentive Plan."
(6)The
plan amounts shown below are reported in this column.
For
Messrs. White, Freyman, and Blaser, the amounts shown alongside the officer's name are for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For
Messrs. Yoor and Warmuth, the amounts shown are for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

B. B. Yoor: $51,896 / ($2,330); B. J. Blaser: $43,363 / $10,350 / $65,871; and M. J. Warmuth: $101,534 / $1,750.
Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan
M. D. White:
$2,776,331 / ($332,475) / $770,577; T. C. Freyman: $46,921 / ($1,055,904) /
$2,020,109; B. B. Yoor: $395,494 / $131,766; B. J. Blaser: $418,877 / $169,587 / $470,457; and M. J. Warmuth: $633,986 / $268.
Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan Earnings
The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, the Abbott Laboratories
401(k) Supplemental Plan, and the 1986 Abbott Laboratories Management Incentive Plan (although none of the named officers currently receives awards under this plan).
M. D. White:
$937,518 / $612,230 / $528,055; T. C. Freyman: $167,089 / $110,563 / $82,400;
B. B. Yoor: $5,883 / $2,490; B. J. Blaser: $92,651 / $50,090 / $27,287; and M. J. Warmuth: $170,029 / $107,561.
(7)The
amounts shown below are reported in this column.
For
Messrs. White, Freyman, and Blaser, the amounts shown alongside the officer's name are for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For
Messrs. Yoor and Warmuth, the amounts shown are for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Earnings on Non-Qualified Defined Benefit and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plans (net of the
reportable interest included in footnote 6).
M. D. White:
$306,382 / $567,345 / $596,788; T. C. Freyman: $62,434 / $75,485 / $84,855;
B. B. Yoor: $0 / $304; B. J. Blaser: $13,484 / $11,863 / $27,727; and M. J. Warmuth: $55,085 / $62,146.
Each
of the named officers' awards under the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan is paid in cash to the officer on a current basis and
may be deposited into a grantor trust established by the officer, net of maximum tax withholdings. Each of the named officers has also established grantor trusts in connection with the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, the Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan, and, other than Mr. Yoor, the 1986 Abbott Laboratories Management Incentive Plan (although none of the
named officers currently receives awards under the Management Incentive Plan). These amounts include the trusts' earnings (net of the reportable interest included in footnote 6).
Employer Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans
M. D. White:
$95,000 / $95,000 / $98,654; T. C. Freyman: $49,972 / $48,755 / $50,630;
B. B. Yoor: $29,212 / $21,894; B. J. Blaser: $34,603 / $33,750 / $34,500; and M. J. Warmuth: $34,594 / $33,750.
These
amounts include employer contributions to both Abbott's tax-qualified defined contribution plan and the Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental
Plan. The Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan permits Abbott's officers to contribute amounts in excess of the limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions to 401(k)
plans up to the excess of (i) 18% of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to Abbott's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Abbott matches participant contributions at the rate of
250% of the first 2% of compensation contributed to the plan. The named officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by the
officer, net of maximum tax withholdings.
Other Compensation
Messrs. White's
and Freyman's non-business-related flights on corporate aircraft are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant to which
they reimburse Abbott for certain costs associated with those flights in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. The following amounts are included in the totals in this column,
which reflect Abbott's incremental cost less reimbursements for non-business-related flights: M. D. White: $204,527 / $216,811 / $217,954; and T. C. Freyman:
$14,963 / $15,972 / $9,682.
Abbott
determines the incremental cost for flights based on the direct cost to Abbott, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees,
catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous direct costs.
For
Mr. White, the following costs associated with security are included: $219,680 / $212,350 / $193,040. Abbott determines the cost
for these expenses based on its actual costs. The security is provided on the recommendation of an independent security study.
Also
included in the totals shown in the table is the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the officer:
T. C. Freyman: $20,349 / $18,916 / $15,395; B. B. Yoor: $20,178 / $18,295; B. J. Blaser: $18,511 / $22,236 /

Table of Contents


$27,867;
and M. J. Warmuth: $7,906 / $7,748. The amounts paid to Mr. Warmuth were paid in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2016
exchange rate of 1.025 U.S. dollars to the Swiss Franc and at the December 31, 2015 exchange rate of 1.0045 U.S. dollars to the Swiss Franc, respectively.  


For
Messrs. Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, and Warmuth, the following costs associated with financial planning are included: T. C. Freyman:
$4,937 / $4,497 / $3,449; B. B. Yoor: $10,833 / $0; B. J. Blaser: $0 / $7,487 / $0; and M. J. Warmuth: $10,000 / $10,000.
For
Mr. Warmuth, this amount includes $174,224 and $167,659 for expatriate program benefits (for 2016 and 2015, respectively) and $590,815
in 2015 for a tax equalization payment (to avoid double taxation in the United States and Switzerland) under Abbott's program for employees working on expatriate assignments. In 2016, Mr. Warmuth did
not receive a tax equalization payment. The 2015 tax equalization payment was in Swiss francs and converted to U.S. dollars at the December 31, 2015 exchange rate of 1.0045 U.S. dollars to the
Swiss franc.
The
named officers are also eligible to participate in an executive disability benefit described on page 58.
(8)To
demonstrate how year over year changes in pension value impact total compensation, as determined under SEC rules, we have included this column to
show total compensation without pension value changes. The amounts reported in this column are calculated by subtracting the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column, as described in footnote 6 to this table, from the amounts reported in the Total column. The amounts reported in this column differ from,
and are not a substitute for, the amounts reported in the Total column.

(1)During
2016, each of the named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, an annual, non-equity incentive plan.
The annual cash incentive award earned by the named officer in 2016 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table under the column captioned, "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No
future payouts will be made under the plan's 2016 annual cash incentive award. The Performance Incentive Plan is described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned,
"Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are Made."
(2)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a 5-year term and vest upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target, with no
more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2016, Abbott reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards made on February 19, 2016, vested on
February 19, 2017. The equity targets are described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeLong-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)."
(3)In
the event of a grantee's death or disability, these awards are deemed fully earned. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control is
described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the
same rate as all other shareholders.
(4)Options
with respect to one-third of the shares covered by these awards are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three
years. The options vest in the event of the grantee's death or disability. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control is described in the section of the proxy statement captioned,
"Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the
average of the high and low market prices (rounded-up to the next even penny) of an Abbott common share on the date of grant.
(5)Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of restricted shares granted by the average of the high and low
market prices of a common share on the grant date.
(6)These
values were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The model uses the assumptions described
in Note 9, entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" in Abbott's 2016
Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.

PENSION BENEFITS









During
2016, the named officers participated in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and
the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature Abbott uses to attract officers who are at
the mid-point of their careers. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have spent most of their careers at Abbott.
Except as provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change in control agreements are described on
pages 58 and 59. 
The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary
Compensation Table on page 44. 
 
  




  ANNUITY RETIREMENT PLAN



 
The Annuity Retirement Plan covers most employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal
retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  

A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by
years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 0.50% of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage
base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit service.
C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 
The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and
employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Annuity Retirement Plan
covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003 who terminate
prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to
age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50
with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
​54      Abbott
Laboratories



 
Table of Contents
The
Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Employees
who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with
10 years of service. Employees hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit service
total 70 or more. As of December 31, 2016, Messrs. White, Freyman, and Warmuth were eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching
age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit
is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement:


 In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are
made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. 
 Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age
plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94
before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement applies,
Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 12/3 percent for each year
between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for
each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before
age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 
  




  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN



 
With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement
Plan:


 Officers' 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of
payments under Abbott's non-equity incentive plans. 
 The Annuity Retirement Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan in
its calculation of a participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a
participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election as an officer, Abbott officers are no longer eligible to
defer compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Annuity Retirement Plan, officers are eligible for a benefit equal to 0.6% of 5-year final
average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum percentage
allowed under the Annuity Retirement Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B, and C above). The portion of this additional officer benefit attributable to service prior to 2004 is reduced
3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year for each
year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion
attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
 The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The benefits
provided to Abbott's officers under the Supplemental Pension Plan are reduced from the plan's unreduced retirement age, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. As of 

​
Abbott
Laboratories      55
​



 
Table of Contents


December
31, 2016, Messrs. White, Freyman, and Warmuth were eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 


 Vested plan benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the officer. Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those officers who were elected prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan
benefits funded through a grantor trust. Officers elected after 2008 may only have the vested plan benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which the officer is first elected funded through
a grantor trust. Vested plan benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the
participants' income. 

Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental
Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

(1)Abbott
calculates these present values using: (i) a 4.60% discount rate for the Annuity Retirement Plan and a 4.47% discount rate for the
Supplemental Pension Plan, the same effective discount rates it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 calculations for financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's
unreduced retirement age. The present values shown in the table reflect post-retirement mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2006 Combined
Healthy table with projected mortality improvements), but do not include a factor for pre-retirement termination, mortality, or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the officer's individual trust
are expected to offset Abbott's obligations to the officer under the plan. During 2016, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established by the
named officers. Grantor trusts are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisBenefits and Perquisites."

(1)Mr. Blaser's
contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan ceased after he became an Abbott officer.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 75 percent of their base salary and up to 100 percent of their annual cash incentives and
credits a participant's account with an amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under Abbott's tax-qualified defined contribution
plan. Participants may direct the investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral and the deferral account are credited with
investment returns based on the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2016, the weighted average rate of return credited to Mr. Blaser's account was 3.5 percent.  

The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make
distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants
may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the hardship.  


(3)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(4)The
amounts reported in this column have not been previously reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table because they relate to
contributions made before Mr. Blaser became a named officer.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL









 
  




  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATIONGENERALLY



 
Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. 
The
following summarizes the payments that the named officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2016. Earnings would have continued to be paid to the named
officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend
on the period over which the trusts' assets were distributed and the trusts' earnings. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current earnings, the named officers
would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period:


 M. D. White, $1,231,315 
 T. C. Freyman, $225,470 
 B. B. Yoor, $29,972 
 B. J. Blaser, $137,501 
 M. J. Warmuth, $232,160 

In
addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for the following named officers:


 B. B. Yoor, $144,904 
 B. J. Blaser, $49,161 
 M. J. Warmuth, $479,186 

If
the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers also would have received, in addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability
benefit in the amount of:


 M. D. White, $160,000 
 T. C. Freyman, $67,375 
 B. B. Yoor, $31,140 
 B. J. Blaser, $33,215 
 M. J. Warmuth, $36,500 

This
long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the officer retires, recovers, dies, or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In
addition, if the named officer's employment had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31, 2016 with
values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Equity Awards." 
 
  




  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL



 
Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement with Abbott.
Abbott
has change in control arrangements with other key members of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for certain other
management personnel. The agreements with Messrs. Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, and Warmuth are described below. 
Each
change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2018, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal
is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the
one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years
following a change in control of Abbott, 
​
58      Abbott
Laboratories



 
Table of Contents
the
officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this purpose that all target performance goals
have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus
period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed performance
period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason during a potential change
in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of the bonus to which the officer is
entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the potential change in control and the
bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer in the preceding three years. Bonus
payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits, outplacement services
and tax and financial counseling, and the value of three more years of pension accruals). 
If
change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, payments under the agreement will be reduced to
prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the executive in a better after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit
the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. 
For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the
outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors whose appointment was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under the agreements
includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the executive's
position, duties, or authority; Abbott's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of Abbott's principal executive offices
to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2016 immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Messrs. Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, and Warmuth would have
been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements:

  EQUITY AWARDS



 
Under Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, upon a change in control, the surviving company may assume, convert, or replace awards to executive
officers on an equivalent basis. If the surviving company does not do so, then the awards vest. If the surviving company does assume, convert, or replace the awards on an equivalent basis, then the
awards vest if the officer's employment is terminated without cause or the officer resigns for good reason during the period six months prior to and through two years after a change in control. The
term "good reason" has the same definition as in the change of control agreements. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2016, and the surviving company did not assume, convert, or replace the awards, then Messrs. White, Freyman, Yoor, Blaser, and Warmuth
would have vested in the following options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units:

  RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS AUDITORS  (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Abbott's By-Laws provide that the Audit Committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as
auditors. In October 2016, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to act as auditors for 2017. Ernst & Young LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2014. 
Although
the Audit Committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for
2017. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2017, the Audit
Committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2017.
Representatives
of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be
available to respond to appropriate questions. 
 
  




  AUDIT FEES AND NON-AUDIT FEES



 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and fees billed for other services rendered by Ernst & Young during these periods.

  POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR



 
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent auditor
and its related affiliates. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm
and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered
public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent
registered public accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at
its next scheduled meeting.  
 











REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE









Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit
of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as
well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this context, the
Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public
accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 16  (Communications with Audit Committees),
 as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 61 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees" is
compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

SAY ON PAYAN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission
rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related material included in this proxy statement. 
As
noted in our proxy summary, 2016 was a year of strong operational results and key strategic advancements. 
Compensation
for executive officers is determined by the Compensation Committee based on Company performance relative to our peer group, executive officer performance relative to goals, and
compensation levels relative to our peer group. Despite the significant positive impact of the closing of the St. Jude Medical acquisition on our stock price (moving Abbott's relative TSR to
the top of our peer group at the time the Compensation Committee awarded bonuses and made LTI awards in 2017) and the critical importance of the
transaction on our long-term strategy, the pay decisions outlined below did not reflect the impact of the acquisition, as it closed after the end of
2016. Compensation decisions based on 2016 performance were made in February 2017 as follows:


 Base salary increases averaged 1.3%. The CEO did not receive an increase; his base salary was last adjusted in 2010.  
 Average bonus payouts were 92% of target despite overachievement of goals related to EPS, net income, cash flow, return on assets and 99.8%
achievement of the sales goal. Individual payouts were aligned with performance and ranged from 10% to 122% of target. 
 The value of 2017 LTI awards was targeted at the 25th percentile of our peer group, consistent with lower relative total shareholder
returns through 2016. Individual awards were aligned with individual performance and ranged from the 5th to the 51st percentile. On average, the value of 2017 LTI grants that were
awarded to executive officers was 22% less than the value of the 2016 grants, with the CEO receiving 22% less as well. If we had granted at the 50th percentile instead of the 25th, the grant
guidelines would have been approximately $2 million higher for the CEO and $650,000 higher for each of the other NEOs. 

The
impact of these pay decisions on our CEO's compensation is shown in the table below:

It
is important to note that the amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table (page 44) reflect the annual bonus for 2016 performance, but the LTI awards shown are for 2015 performance. Due
to the significantly different LTI amounts granted in 2017 (using the 25th percentile guidelines) vs. 2016 (using the 50th percentile guidelines), we have disclosed the 2017 grant in
this proxy to aid shareholders in their understanding of our approach to compensation which definitively aligns our LTI grant guidelines with relative TSR (as outlined on page 35). 
Our
compensation design and alignment with results have consistently received very strong support from our shareholders on the annual Say on Pay vote. Each year since the separation of AbbVie in 2013,
we received a minimum of 94% votes FOR our executive compensation program.

Table of Contents
We
made design changes during this time that reflect feedback from shareholders, as well as changes in our business. Some of the changes made include the following: 





 Selected a new peer group that reflects the globally diverse and consumer-facing aspects of Abbott 
 Increased executive share ownership guidelines 
 Increased director share ownership guidelines 
 Added a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met 
 Eliminated single-trigger vesting of equity in the event of a change in control 
 Eliminated tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy 
 Implemented a one-year minimum vesting period for long-term incentive grants 
 Increased the ROE target for performance shares in 2015 and again in 2016 
 Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology 
 Revised long-term incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period 
 Increased disclosure related to payouts for annual and long-term incentives 
 Implemented a strengthened recoupment policy 
 Retained an independent Compensation Committee consultant who performs no other work for Abbott 




We
received positive feedback on these changes from our shareholders during our extensive shareholder outreach. 
The
Compensation Committee, with the counsel of its independent consultant, concluded that the compensation reported herein was earned and appropriate. The specific details of the executive
compensation program and compensation paid to the named executive officers are described on pages 27 through 41 of this proxy statement. 
While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results and take into account the
results and our ongoing dialogue with shareholders when future compensation decisions are made. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers' compensation.

  SAY WHEN ON PAYAN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF THE FREQUENCY OF SHAREHOLDER VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 4 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Shareholders are being asked to vote on how often Abbott should present shareholders with the opportunity to vote on the compensation awarded
to its named officers. 
Abbott
believes that an annual vote is most appropriate. 
You
may vote to have this vote held annually, every two years, or every three years, or you may abstain. The vote is advisory and non-binding. 
The
compensation committee will consider the outcome, along with other relevant factors, in recommending a voting frequency to the board of directors. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR an ANNUAL (1 YEAR) shareholder advisory vote about compensation awarded to Abbott's named
officers.

  APPROVAL OF THE ABBOTT LABORATORIES 2017 INCENTIVE STOCK PROGRAM (ITEM 5 ON PROXY CARD)




 
The Board of Directors has adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (the "Plan"). A copy
of the Plan is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit B. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Plan.  
  
  




  WHY SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD APPROVE THE PLAN



 


 Additional shares are needed.
  Abbott expects that the current equity program will run out of shares available for grant prior to the 2018 Annual Meeting. If shareholders do not approve the Plan and Abbott cannot
grant equity awards, Abbott will be placed at a competitive disadvantage, making it difficult to attract, retain, and motivate its employees, officers, and non-employee directors. 


In
a typical year, over 99% of grants awarded are extended to employees other than executive officers. The Plan is expected to benefit approximately 11,000 employees in 70 countries around the world. 
 Equity awards are an important component of Abbott's compensation
program.  The Plan will enable Abbott to attract and retain the services of employees, officers, and non-employee directors.  
Equity incentives align the interests of our employees, officers and non-employee directors with those of other
shareholders. Abbott believes that equity incentives motivate recipients to focus on growth in shareholder value.   
 The Plan provides flexibility.
  Abbott will be able to continue to adapt the compensation of key individuals to accommodate changes in best practices, law, accounting principles, and corporate objectives if the Plan is
approved. 
Approval of the Plan includes approval of the material terms of performance goals for Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code ("Internal Revenue Code" or the "Code"). Shareholder approval of the Plan permits the Compensation Committee to grant awards to Abbott's covered employees
that may be tax deductible regardless of the Code Section 162(m) limits. 

Upon
shareholder approval, the Plan will replace the 2009 Incentive Stock Program, as amended (the "Prior Plan"). No further awards will be granted under the Prior Plan, and any shares remaining
available for grant will be retired and not transferred to the Plan. In addition, no awards have been or will be granted under the St. Jude Medical, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. If
the Plan is not approved by shareholders, then the Plan will not become effective and the Prior Plan will continue in full force and effect. 
An
aggregate of 170 million shares initially will be available for issuance under the Plan. This number was determined based on analysis of various factors, including the average share usage
rate ("burn rate"), potential dilution, industry plan cost standards, and anticipated equity compensation needs. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, the Prior Plan's burn rate was 1.8 percent, calculated
as of December 31, 2016, as follows: 
The
Aggregate Number of Shares Subject to Awards Granted during the Year*
Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding during the Year 

*Full
Value Awards are adjusted, with each share counting as three shares. (A "Full Value Award" is any award settled in shares, other than an option or stock
appreciation right.) 
The
potential dilution to current shareholders that could result from the future issuance of shares available under the Plan, in addition to shares subject to awards outstanding under the Prior Plan,
would be approximately 13.0 percent, calculated as follows: 
New
Shares Requested + Shares Subject to Outstanding Awards
New Shares Requested + Shares Subject to Outstanding Awards + Total Common Shares Outstanding 
Based
on these factors and Abbott's current grant practices, the shares requested for use under the Plan are expected to meet Abbott's equity grant needs for approximately 4-5 years. The shares
reserved may, however, last for a shorter or longer period of time depending on currently unknown factors, such as the number of grant recipients, future grant practices, and Abbott's share price. 
​

Laboratories



 
Table of Contents




Status of the Prior Plan  
As of December 31, 2016, there were 49,811,696 common shares subject to outstanding awards granted under the Prior Plan, including 35,888,333 options
with a weighted average exercise price of $34.17 and a weighted average remaining term of 5.3 years and 13,923,363 Full Value Awards. 
As
of December 31, 2016, Abbott had 1,472,869,205 total common shares outstanding. The terms and conditions of outstanding awards under the Prior Plan will not be affected by the approval of
the Plan, and the Prior Plan will remain in effect with respect to awards which have already been granted. 
As
noted above, upon shareholder approval of the Plan, no further awards will be granted under the Prior Plan and any shares remaining available under the Prior Plan or the St. Jude
Medical, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan will be retired and not transferred to the Plan; provided, that shares under outstanding Prior Plan awards that are not issued due to forfeiture,
expiration, cancellation, or cash settlement and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations under Prior Plan Full Value Awards will become available for issuance under the Plan. 
 
  




  KEY PLAN FEATURES



 
The Plan is intended to reinforce the alignment between employees' and non-employee directors' interests and shareholders' interests, and purposefully
excludes features that could misalign those interests. Accordingly, the Plan and current award agreements:


 Require one-year minimum vesting for all awards (with 5% exception allowed) 
 Vest executive officer awards under double-trigger Change in Control circumstances 
 Count each Full Value Award share as three shares against the Plan's share reserve 
 Limit grants to any individual participant in a calendar year 
 Authorize the recoupment of awards under the Abbott recoupment policy 
 Prohibit repricing of underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights without shareholder approval, other than in the case of adjustment
for corporate transactions 
 Do not have evergreen share pool provisions 
 Do not have a replacement option feature 
 Do not provide tax gross-ups to officers or non-employee directors 

 
  




  PLAN SUMMARY



 
This summary of the Plan's principal features is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as
Exhibit B. 
The
purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain outstanding employees, officers, and non-employee directors of Abbott and its subsidiaries and to motivate such individuals by providing opportunities
to acquire Abbott common shares or to receive payments based on the value of such shares or on the financial performance of Abbott, or both, on advantageous terms and to further align such persons'
interests with those of Abbott's other shareholders. To enable Abbott to accomplish this, the Plan authorizes the grant of several different forms of benefits including nonqualified stock options,
restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards and foreign benefits ("Benefits" or "awards"). 
Code
Section 162(m) limits the tax deduction available to public companies for annual compensation paid to the chief executive officer and three other most highly paid executive officers other
than the chief financial officer ("covered employees") in excess of $1 million, unless the compensation qualifies as "performance-based" or is otherwise exempt. The Plan provides the
Compensation Committee with the ability to award performance-based compensation to covered employees that is exempt from the tax deduction limits of Code Section 162(m), in part by setting
limits on awards that an individual participant can receive in any year under the Plan: (i) no more than 2 million shares may be subject to stock options and stock appreciation rights;
and (ii) no more than $15 million worth of shares may be subject to Full Value Awards that are performance awards, determined by multiplying the number of shares or units granted
under the award by the fair market value of a common share on the date of grant. However, Abbott may provide compensation under the Plan that is not deductible.

Shares Reserved  
The Plan authorizes the grant of awards with respect to an aggregate of 170 million common shares, plus the number of shares that cease to be subject
to awards under the Prior Plan (for example, awards that expire unexercised or that are forfeited); subject in each case to adjustments as provided below. Each share subject to a Full Value Award
under the Plan shall be counted as three shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award. 
On
February 16, 2017, the closing price of an Abbott common share on the New York Stock Exchange was $44.20. The common shares covered by the Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares
or shares that have been or may be reacquired by Abbott in the open market, in private transactions, or otherwise. 
If
there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture, cancellation, or cash settlement of any Benefit granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan without the issuance of shares, the shares that had
been subject to that Benefit may be used for the grant of new Benefits under the Plan. Any common shares withheld by Abbott to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations arising in
connection with a Full Value Award granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan may be used for the grant of new Benefits. 
Common
shares that are issued under any Benefit and thereafter reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon the issuance of the shares or pursuant to the payment of the exercise price under
stock options by delivery of other Abbott common shares, common shares under options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights that are not issued upon the net exercise or net settlement of the
option or stock appreciation right, and common shares that are exchanged by the grantee or withheld by Abbott to satisfy tax withholding requirements in connection with any Benefit other than a Full
Value Award (whether granted under the Plan or the Prior Plan) will not be available for subsequent awards under the Plan. Benefits settled in cash will not reduce the number of common shares
available for subsequent awards under the Plan. 




Administration  
The Plan provides that grants of Benefits and other determinations under the Plan will be made by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or such
other committee consisting entirely of persons who are both: (i) "non-employee directors" as defined in Rule 16b3 of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended; and (ii) "outside
directors" as defined under Code Section 162(m) (the "Committee"), except that the Committee may delegate its authority to the extent consistent with applicable law and Securities and Exchange
Commission rules, and except that the Chief Executive Officer may grant Benefits under the Plan to eligible persons other than directors and executive officers of Abbott, which grants shall be
reported to the Committee. 
To
the extent not inconsistent with the Plan's provisions, the Committee's powers will include the power:


 to administer the Plan; 
 to exercise all the power and authority either specifically granted to it under the Plan or necessary or advisable in the administration of the
Plan; 
 to grant Benefits; 
 to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which Benefits will be granted; 
 to determine the type and number of Benefits to be granted and the terms and conditions relating to any Benefit;  
 to determine whether and to what extent, a Benefit may be settled, canceled, forfeited, accelerated, exchanged, deferred in accordance with
Section 409A, or surrendered; 
 to make adjustments in the terms and conditions applicable to Benefits; 
 to construe and interpret the Plan and any Benefit; 
 to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; 
 to determine the terms and provisions of any Benefit agreement; and 
 to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. 

All
determinations of the Committee will be made by the vote of a majority of its members, which will constitute a quorum.

Eligibility  
Employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries (including the persons named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44) selected by the Committee will be
eligible to receive Benefits under the Plan. Directors who are not employees of Abbott or its subsidiaries are eligible to receive certain restricted stock unit awards and nonqualified stock options,
as described in more detail below. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 75,000 persons, including 75,000 employees, 18 executive officers and 11 non-employee directors were eligible to
receive awards under the Plan. In connection with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. on January 4, 2017, approximately 19,000 employees joined Abbott, bringing the total
number of persons eligible to receive awards under the Plan to 94,000. 




Duration  
The Plan will continue in effect until the tenth anniversary of its approval by Abbott's shareholders, unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors. 




Adjustments  
The Plan provides for equitable adjustment by the Committee in the event of certain corporate events such as a stock split, special dividend (in cash, shares
or other property), merger, spinoff, or similar occurrence affecting the shares including, for example, adjustments to the number of shares reserved under the Plan, the number of shares covered by, or
issuable pursuant to each outstanding Benefit, the exercise price or purchase price relating to any Benefit, the performance goals, and the individual and share limitations under the Plan. 




No Repricing  
The Plan prohibits repricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights other than in connection with an adjustment. Specifically, the Plan provides that
without prior approval of shareholders, the Committee may not lower the exercise price or base price of an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right nor grant any Benefit or provide cash in
replacement of a canceled stock option or stock appreciation right which had been granted at a higher exercise price or base price. 




Minimum Vesting Requirements  
Except with respect to five percent of the number of shares available for grant as of the effective date of the Plan, the Plan requires a minimum one-year
vesting period for all awards granted under the Plan, other than in connection with an adjustment. The Committee has discretion to accelerate the vesting of awards, provided that such acceleration
does not cause an award subject to a one-year minimum vesting period to vest prior to one year from grant, other than upon a "Change in Control" of Abbott (as defined in the Plan), or upon a
participant's death or disability. (See the section captioned "Other Share-Based Awards and Recognition Awards" below for details regarding additional limits on the grant of vested share awards). 




Options  
The Plan provides that the exercise price of any stock option will be at least 100 percent of the fair market value of the common shares on the grant
date of the option, except in connection with an adjustment. The Committee may provide for the payment of the exercise price in cash, by delivery of other Abbott common shares having a market value
equal to the purchase price of such shares, including by withholding of shares that would otherwise be distributed to the grantee upon exercise, through an open-market broker-assisted transaction, or
by any other method approved by the Committee. 
No
option may be granted with a term in excess of ten years from the date of grant. The Plan contains special rules covering the time of exercise in case of retirement, death, disability, or other
termination of employment. 




Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units  
Restricted stock awards consist of common shares transferred to participants, without payment, as additional compensation for their services to Abbott or one
of its subsidiaries. Restricted stock units consist of a contractual right of the participant to receive common shares, or cash equal in value to those shares, in the future, without payment, as
additional compensation for their services to Abbott or one of its subsidiaries. Restricted stock awards 
​
Abbott
Laboratories      69
​



 
Table of Contents
and
restricted stock units awarded under the Plan will be subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines are appropriate, including without limitation, restrictions on the sale or
other disposition of such shares. 




Performance Awards  
The Plan permits the grant of performance awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other share-based awards. The goals established
by the Committee shall be based on any one or a combination of earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets, return on net assets, return on investment, total shareholder return, net
operating income, cash flow, increase in revenue, economic value added, increase in share price or cash flow return on investment, and may be applied to the performance of Abbott, a subsidiary, or a
division or strategic business unit of Abbott, or may be applied to Abbott performance relative to a market index, a group of other companies or a combination thereof, all as determined by the
Committee. The performance goals may include a
threshold level of performance below which no payment will be made (or no vesting will occur), levels of performance at which specified payments will be made (or specified vesting will occur), and a
maximum level of performance above which no additional payment will be made (or at which full vesting will occur). If a Benefit is intended to satisfy the performance-based compensation exception to
the limits of Code Section 162(m), then to the extent consistent with such exception, the Committee may make equitable adjustments to the performance goals in recognition of unusual or
non-recurring events affecting Abbott or any subsidiary or the financial statements of Abbott or any subsidiary, in response to changes in applicable laws or regulations, or to account for items of
gain, loss or expense determined to be unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principles. 




Other Share-Based Awards and Recognition Awards  
The Committee may grant other share-based awards, stock appreciation rights and other awards based on the value of Abbott common shares, subject to such terms
and conditions as the Committee determines are appropriate. The Committee may provide the right to vote and receive dividends on restricted stock and dividend equivalents on restricted stock units
granted under the Plan. Unless otherwise provided, any dividends or dividend equivalents received, including in connection with a stock split of the common shares underlying an award, generally will
be subject to the same restrictions as the common shares underlying the award and any dividend equivalents are included in the participant's ordinary income and deducted by the Company upon payment.
The Plan provides that the base price of any stock appreciation right will be at least equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right, except
in connection with an adjustment, and that a stock appreciation right may not be granted with a term in excess of ten years from the date of grant. The Committee may grant no more than one thousand
fully vested common shares to any one individual in any one calendar year, as a "recognition award". 




Foreign Benefits  
The Committee may grant Benefits to such officers and employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries who reside in foreign jurisdictions, subject to such terms and
conditions as the Committee determines are appropriate. The Committee may amend or vary the terms of the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of each jurisdiction where a
subsidiary is located as it considers necessary or desirable to take into account or to mitigate the burden of taxation and social security contributions for participants and/or the subsidiary, or
amend or vary the terms of the Plan in a jurisdiction where the subsidiary is located as it considers necessary or desirable to meet the objectives of the Plan. The Committee may establish one or more
sub-plans for these purposes. The Committee may establish administrative rules and procedures to facilitate the operation of the Plan in such jurisdictions. To the extent permitted under applicable
law, the Committee, which may delegate its authority and responsibilities regarding Foreign Benefits to one or more officers of Abbott, has delegated its authority and responsibilities with respect to
the administration of Benefits granted to officers and employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries who reside in foreign jurisdictions to the Executive Vice President of Human Resources. 




Nonqualified Stock Options to Non-Employee Directors  
The Plan permits each director of Abbott who is not also an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries ("non-employee directors") to elect to receive any or all
of his or her directors' fees earned under Abbott's Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the form of nonqualified stock options, provided that such election is made by December 31 of the year
preceding the period in which the fees are earned. The fees covered by any such election will be converted to stock

Table of Contents
options
based on a reasonable valuation method. Each nonqualified stock option due to a director under this Plan will be granted annually, on the date of the annual shareholders meeting, will be
immediately exercisable and non-forfeitable and will not be exercisable after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. 




Restricted Stock Units to Non-Employee Directors  
The Plan also provides that restricted stock units will automatically be awarded to each person elected a director of Abbott at the annual shareholders
meeting who is not also an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries. The awards will be made on the date the person is elected as a director, and each award will cover a number of common shares set by
the Board in its sole discretion, upon recommendation by the Committee, provided that the fair market value of the shares on the award date will not exceed $250,000. The shares covered by the awards
will be fully vested on the award date. The non-employee director receiving the restricted stock units will be entitled to receive one common share for each restricted stock unit upon the earliest of
the date the director experiences a
"separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), the date the director dies or the date of a Change in Control that also qualifies as a "change in control event" within the
meaning of Code Section 409A. 




Change in Control  
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (including award agreements with executive officers), upon the occurrence of a Change in Control of Abbott,
the Plan provides that: (i) stock options will become fully vested and exercisable; (ii) terms and conditions of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units will be deemed to be
satisfied, and all restrictions will lapse; (iii) other share-based awards will become fully vested and stock appreciation rights will become fully vested and exercisable; and
(iv) performance awards will be deemed to have been fully earned and immediately payable. The Plan's award agreements for Abbott's executive officers provide for accelerated vesting of Benefits
in connection with a Change in Control only in double-trigger circumstances. 




Tax Withholding  
The Committee may permit or require a participant to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local taxes (in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions), including
social security and Medicare withholding tax, arising in connection with the receipt or exercise of any Benefit, by having Abbott withhold shares or by delivering shares received in connection with
the Benefit or previously acquired, having a fair market value approximating the amount to be withheld, by having Abbott or a subsidiary withhold from any cash compensation payable to the participant
or sell shares issued pursuant to a Benefit and withhold from the proceeds, or by having the participant repay Abbott for taxes paid on the participant's behalf. 




Nontransferability  
Except as provided by the Committee, Benefits granted under the Plan will be exercisable only by the holder during the holder's lifetime; provided, however,
that such Benefits will be transferable by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 




Amendment and Termination  
The Plan may be amended from time to time or terminated by the Board of Directors. In the absence of shareholder approval, however, no such amendment may
increase the aggregate number of shares available
for Benefits, extend the term of the Plan, or change or add a category or categories of individuals who are eligible to participate in the Plan. In addition, without the written consent of the holder,
no amendment or termination of the Plan may materially and adversely modify the holder's rights under the terms and conditions of an outstanding Benefit, except that the Plan may be amended for
purposes of granting Benefits to employees in foreign jurisdictions (as described above under "Foreign Benefits") or as needed to comply with any tax or regulatory requirement, as determined by the
Board of Directors or the Committee. Without limiting the foregoing, the Plan provides that the Plan or any Benefit may be amended without the consent of the holder to comply with or qualify for
exemption from Code Section 409A and, to the extent permitted by Section 409A, the maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right may be extended as necessary to allow for
exercise of such award following a period during which exercise was prohibited by applicable law.

New Plan Benefits  
Future awards of Benefits under the Plan will be determined by the Committee and may vary from year to year and from participant to participant. Future awards
under the Plan are generally not determinable at this time because the awards are discretionary and/or depend on the value of Abbott's common shares at the time that grants are determined. In
addition, as discussed above, under the Plan, each non-employee director who is elected to the Board of Directors at the annual shareholder meeting receives an award of a number of restricted stock
units covering the number of common shares having a fair market value on the date of the grant not exceeding $250,000. In 2016, this was 3,799 restricted stock units. The Plan also permits each
non-employee director to elect to receive any or all of his or her directors' fees earned under Abbott's Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the form of nonqualified stock options. In 2016, if this
election had been made, then the following options would have been received: Audit Committee Chairman, options covering 15,062 shares; Compensation Committee Chairman, options covering 14,522 shares;
Public Policy Committee Chairman, options covering 14,184 shares; other committee chairs, options covering 14,184 shares; other audit committee members, options covering 13,373 shares; the lead
director, options covering 15,197 shares; and other non-employee directors, options covering 12,765 shares. 
 
  




  FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES



 
The following discussion is a brief summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences of the Plan for a participant who is a U.S. tax
resident under the provisions of the Code currently in effect. The Internal Revenue Code and its regulations are subject to change. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe,
among other things, state, local or foreign income and other tax consequences. The specific tax consequences to a participant will depend upon that participant's individual circumstances. 




Options and Stock Appreciation Rights  
Under existing law and regulations, the grant of nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights will not result in income taxable to the employee or
director or provide a deduction to Abbott. However, the exercise of a nonqualified stock option or stock appreciation right results in taxable income to the holder, and Abbott may be entitled to a
corresponding tax deduction, subject to the limits of Code Section 162(m). At the time of the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the participant will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates
on the excess of the fair market value of the shares purchased over the option's exercise price. At the time of the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the participant will be taxed at ordinary
income tax rates on the amount of the cash, or the fair market value of the shares, received by the employee upon exercise. 




Restricted Stock Awards  
A participant in the Plan who is granted a restricted stock award will not be taxed upon the acquisition of such shares so long as the interest in such shares
is subject to a "substantial risk of forfeiture" within the meaning of Code Section 83. Upon lapse or release of the restrictions, the recipient will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on an
amount equal to the then current fair market value of the shares. Any such awards that are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture will be taxed at the time of grant. Abbott may be entitled to
a corresponding tax deduction when the value of the award is included in the recipient's taxable income, subject to the limits of Code Section 162(m). The basis of restricted shares held after
lapse or termination of restrictions will be equal to their fair market value on the date of lapse or termination of restrictions, and upon subsequent disposition any further gain or loss will be a
long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon the length of time the shares are held. A recipient of a restricted stock award may elect to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on the
full fair market value of the restricted shares at the time of grant. If this election is made, the basis of the shares acquired will be equal to the fair market value at the time of grant, no tax
will be payable upon the subsequent lapse or release of the restrictions, and any gain or loss upon disposition will be a capital gain or loss. 




Restricted Stock Units  
An employee or non-employee director who is granted a restricted stock unit will not be taxed upon the grant of the award. Upon receipt of payment of cash or
common shares pursuant to a restricted stock unit, the employee or non-employee director will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to any cash received and the fair market value of any common
shares received. Subject to the limits of Code Section 162(m), Abbott may be entitled to an income tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the employee or
non-employee director. 
​

Laboratories
​



 
Table of Contents




Performance Awards  
A recipient of a performance award will generally realize ordinary income at the time common shares are transferred or cash is paid to the grantee with
respect to such award. Abbott may be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, subject to the limits of Code Section 162(m). 




Section 162(m)  
Stock options and stock appreciation rights will satisfy the Section 162(m) "performance-based compensation" exception if the awards are made by a
qualifying compensation committee, the underlying program sets the maximum number of shares that can be granted to any person within a specified period, and the compensation is based solely on an
increase in the stock price after the grant date (i.e., the option exercise price is equal to or greater than the fair market value of the stock subject
to the award on the grant date). Performance or incentive awards, such as performance-based restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other share-based awards granted under the Plan may qualify as
"qualified performance-based" compensation for purposes of Code Section 162(m), if such awards meet Code requirements. 




Section 409A  
Section 409A of the Code imposes certain requirements on nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements. These include requirements on an individual's
election to defer compensation and the individual's selection of the timing and form of distribution of the deferred compensation. Section 409A also generally provides that distributions must
be made on or following the occurrence of certain events (such as the individual's separation from service, a predetermined date, or the individual's death). Section 409A imposes restrictions
on an individual's ability to change his or her distribution timing or form after the compensation has been deferred. For certain individuals who are officers, Section 409A requires that such
individual's distribution commence no earlier than six months after such officer's separation from service. Certain awards under the Plan may be designed to be subject to the requirements of
Section 409A in form and in operation. For example, restricted stock units that provide for a settlement date following the vesting date may be subject to Section 409A. If an award under
the Plan is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award may recognize ordinary income on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent
vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or constructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with the requirements of
Section 409A, Section 409A imposes an additional 20 percent federal penalty tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as interest on such deferred compensation. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program.

  APPROVAL OF THE ABBOTT LABORATORIES 2017 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN FOR NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES (ITEM 6 ON PROXY CARD)



 
The Board of Directors has adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S.
Employees (the "ESPP"). The ESPP is an amendment and restatement of the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees (the "2009 ESPP"), under which an aggregate of
fifteen million Abbott common shares have been reserved for issuance, including the shares authorized but not yet issued under the 2009 ESPP, and with a term extending through July 31, 2027. A
copy of the ESPP is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit C. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the ESPP.  
  
  




  ESPP SUMMARY



 
The ESPP is a broad-based plan offering eligible employees the opportunity to acquire a stock ownership interest in Abbott, through periodic contributions
applied towards the purchase of Abbott common shares at a discount from the then-current market price. Currently, the ESPP is offered in 67 countries. 100% of shares are issued to employees other than
executive officers. The purpose of the Plan is to provide an opportunity for non-U.S. employees of certain Abbott subsidiaries to share in Abbott's growth. 
This
summary of the principal features of the ESPP is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ESPP, which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit C. 




Administration  
The ESPP provides that either the Compensation Committee or any other committee as the Board of Directors may designate from time to time (the
"Administrator") will administer the ESPP. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Administrator may delegate its authority and responsibilities under the ESPP to one or more Abbott officers
at any time in its sole discretion. 
The
Administrator and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, its delegate(s), have full power and authority to promulgate any rules and regulations deemed necessary for the proper
administration of the ESPP, to interpret the provisions and supervise the administration of the ESPP, to reconcile any inconsistency, correct any default and supply any omission in the terms of the
ESPP and any instrument or agreement relating to the ESPP, to make factual determinations relevant to ESPP entitlements and to take all action in connection with administration of the ESPP as deemed
necessary or advisable. Decisions of each of the Administrator and, where applicable, its delegate(s) will be final and binding upon all eligible employees who elect to participate in the ESPP. Abbott
will pay all reasonable expenses incurred in the administration of the ESPP. 
The
Administrator may amend or vary the terms of the ESPP (other than the ten-year term), including through the adoption of one or more sub-plans, to: (i) conform such terms with the
requirements of each jurisdiction where an Employer (as defined below) is located, (ii) take into account or mitigate or reduce the burden of taxation and social security contributions for
participants and/or the Employer, or (iii) meet the goals and objectives of the ESPP. 




Eligibility and Participation  
Any individual who is an employee, as defined under the ESPP, of a participating Abbott subsidiary (each an "Employer"), is eligible to participate in the
ESPP. However, the Administrator or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, an Employer, may prospectively condition participation by its employees upon a period of service with such Employer.
Abbott's officers and directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP. A participant's employment with an Employer will be deemed to be terminated on the day such entity ceases to be an Abbott
subsidiary. 
Eligible
employees may join a purchase cycle prior to the start of that purchase cycle. The first purchase cycle under the ESPP will commence on August 1, 2017 and end on January 31,
2018. As of December 31, 2016, Abbott estimates that approximately 60,000 employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP.

Securities Subject to the ESPP  
An aggregate of fifteen million Abbott common shares have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP, which includes the number of shares authorized but not
yet issued under the 2009 ESPP, subject to adjustment as described below under "Adjustments." To the extent permitted under applicable stock exchange rules, shares may be purchased pursuant to a
formula under certain sub-plans without regard to this limit. 
The
shares may be authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares purchased on the open market, or a combination of each, as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. If any
purchase right granted under the ESPP expires or terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject to that purchase right will become available under the
ESPP. 
If
on any purchase date the number of shares otherwise purchasable by participants is greater than the number of shares then remaining available under the ESPP, the Administrator will allocate the
available shares among the participants in such manner as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion. 




Purchase Cycles and Purchase Dates  
Abbott common shares will be offered under the ESPP through a series of purchase cycles. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, including with
respect to a particular jurisdiction, subsidiary, or sub-plan, each purchase cycle will be six consecutive calendar months and subsequent purchase cycles will run consecutively after each preceding
purchase cycle. Purchases will occur on the last business day of each purchase cycle. Except where prohibited by applicable law, the Administrator will have the power to make any changes without
approval of the Board of Directors, and without regard to the expectations of any participants; provided, however, that
Abbott and/or the Employer must notify participants of any such change at least 30 days before such change becomes effective. 




Purchase Price  
The purchase price of the Abbott common shares acquired on each purchase date will be 85% of the lesser of (i) the closing selling price per share of
Abbott common shares on the date such purchase cycle begins and (ii) the closing selling price per share of Abbott common shares on the last business day of such purchase cycle. 
The
closing selling price of Abbott common shares on any relevant date under the ESPP will be deemed to be equal to the closing selling price per share on such date as reported in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transactions, or if no sale has been reported in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transactions on that date, the closing price reported in the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transactions on the last preceding date on which there was a sale. On February 16, 2017, the closing selling price per common share determined on such basis was $44.20 per share. 




Payroll Deductions/Contributions and Stock Purchases  
Each participant may authorize periodic payroll deductions in any multiple of 1% to 10% (or such other maximum percentage that may be specified by the
Administrator), in whole percentages only, of his or her eligible compensation. Where payroll deductions are prohibited under local law, an Employer may permit its participants to contribute to the
ESPP by an alternative method of contribution, including personal checks or direct debits from personal bank accounts. Under procedures established by his or her Employer, a participant's
authorization and enrollment form will continue in effect from one purchase cycle to the next, unless the participant suspends his or her payroll deductions or contributions or discontinues his or her
participation in the ESPP. Unless otherwise prohibited under local law or unless alternative procedures are established by the Administrator in its sole discretion, each Employer will convert the
payroll deductions or contributions of its participants paid in non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars as soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable payroll deduction date. For purposes of
the ESPP, eligible compensation means the basic rate of cash remuneration of any employee as it appears on the books and records of such employee's Employer. 
Unless
a participant has previously ceased participation in the ESPP during a purchase cycle, a participant's purchase right will be automatically exercised on each purchase date to purchase that
number of full Abbott common shares that the balance credited to such participant's account will entitle him or her to purchase. Any cash remaining in a participant's account after the purchase of
Abbott common shares may be applied towards a notional interest in a fractional common share. Upon distribution of a participant's account, any fractional interest will be paid in cash.

Special Limitations  
The ESPP imposes certain limitations upon a participant's right to acquire Abbott common shares, including that no participant may contribute more than the
equivalent in local currency of $12,500 during any purchase cycle towards the purchase of Abbott common shares. 




Discontinuance of Participation or Termination of Employment  
The participant may discontinue participation in the ESPP during a purchase cycle and his or her accumulated payroll deductions will be refunded without
interest (unless otherwise required under local law) as soon as administratively practicable. A participant who discontinues participation during a purchase cycle will be ineligible to participate in
the ESPP until he or she re-enrolls in the ESPP for a subsequent purchase cycle in accordance with the ESPP. 
If
a participant terminates employment with his or her Employer for any reason prior to the expiration of a purchase cycle, then the participant's participation in the ESPP will immediately terminate
and the amount credited to the participant's account will be refunded as soon as reasonably practicable. 




Shareholder Rights  
No participant will have any voting, dividend, or other shareholder rights with respect to Abbott common shares subject to any purchase right under the ESPP
until the common shares have been purchased and delivered to the participant or into an account for the benefit of the participant as provided in the ESPP. 




Adjustments  
If after the grant of a purchase right, but prior to the purchase of Abbott common shares with respect to a particular purchase period, there is any increase
or decrease in the number of outstanding Abbott common shares because of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or recapitalization, the Administrator in its sole discretion will make any
substitution or adjustment as it deems appropriate with respect to: the maximum number and kind of Abbott common shares that may be issued under the ESPP, the purchase price per share of Abbott common
shares, and any other limitations provided under the ESPP. 
In
the event Abbott effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, spin-offs, split-ups, rights offerings or reductions of its outstanding common shares, the Administrator in its sole
discretion may make any substitution or adjustment as it deems appropriate with respect to: the maximum number of Abbott common shares available under the ESPP, the purchase price per share of Abbott
common shares covered by each outstanding purchase right, and any other limitations provided under the ESPP. 




Assignability  
No purchase rights will be assignable or transferable by the participant. Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be null and
void and without effect. 




Liquidation or Dissolution  
In the event of the proposed liquidation or dissolution of Abbott, the purchase cycle then in progress will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of
such proposed liquidation or dissolution, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator in its sole discretion, and all outstanding purchase rights will automatically terminate and the amounts of all
payroll deductions will be refunded without interest (unless otherwise required under local law) to the participants as soon as reasonably practicable. 




Change in Control  
In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Abbott, or the merger or consolidation of Abbott with or into another entity,
then in the sole discretion of the Administrator, (i) each purchase right will be assumed, or an equivalent purchase right will be substituted, by the successor corporation or parent or
subsidiary of such successor corporation, or (ii) a new purchase date will be established by the Administrator on or before the date of the consummation of such merger, consolidation or sale,
and all outstanding purchase rights will be automatically exercised on such new date.

Duration, Termination or Amendment of the ESPP  
If the shareholders approve the 2017 ESPP, then it will be effective on August 1, 2017 and terminate on July 31, 2027, unless terminated earlier
by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion. If shareholders do not approve the 2017 ESPP, then the requested increase in common shares and the extension of the ESPP's term will not become
effective. 
The
Board of Directors may at any time amend the ESPP without shareholder approval; however, shareholder approval must be obtained if required by any applicable laws, stock exchange rules or
regulations. 
The
Board may terminate or suspend the ESPP at any time in its sole discretion, including shortening and establishing a new purchase date for a purchase cycle in connection with a spin-off or other
similar corporate event. The termination, suspension or amendment of the ESPP will not alter rights or obligations under any purchase right previously granted under the ESPP in any material adverse
way without the consent of the affected participants, except as may be necessary or advisable to qualify for or comply with a tax or regulatory requirement. 




Certain Income Tax Consequences  
Abbott does not offer the ESPP to employees in the United States, so the issuance and exercise of purchase rights under the ESPP should generally not have any
federal income tax consequences for Abbott or ESPP participants. However, depending on the tax rules of the foreign jurisdictions in which ESPP participants reside, there may be ordinary income to the
participants at the time of their purchase of common shares under the ESPP. If the participant recognizes ordinary income in connection with his or her purchase of common shares under the ESPP, then
the Employer may be entitled to a deduction in the same amount at the time such ordinary income is recognized. 
In
the event that Abbott or an Employer is required to withhold any applicable taxes with regard to any compensation or other income realized by a participant under the ESPP, then Abbott or such
Employer may deduct from any benefits of any kind otherwise due to a participant, including without limitation the proceeds of any sale of Abbott common shares for the account of the participant, the
aggregate amount of such applicable taxes required to be withheld or, if such payments are insufficient to satisfy such applicable taxes, the participant will be required to pay to Abbott or such
Employer, or make other arrangement satisfactory to Abbott or such Employer regarding payment to Abbott or such Employer of, the aggregate amount of any such taxes. 
The
ESPP is not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
The
foregoing is only a general summary of the effect of income taxation with respect to the purchase of shares under the ESPP and does not discuss U.S. federal income tax laws or the income tax laws
of any municipality, state or foreign country. 




New Plan Benefits  
The benefits to be received by those Abbott employees who are eligible to participate in the amended ESPP are not determinable, since the amounts of future
purchases by participants are based on elective participant contributions and also depend on the value of Abbott's common shares. No purchase rights have been granted, and no common shares have been
issued, with respect to the share increase for which shareholder approval is sought under this Proposal. 




Past Participation in the 2009 ESPP  
The table below sets forth the number of common shares purchased by participating employees since the inception of the 2009 ESPP through December 31,
2016. Executive officers and non-employee directors of the Company (including nominees for election as director) and associates of such individuals, were not eligible to participate in the 2009 ESPP.
No participating employee has purchased five percent or more of the total amount of common shares purchased under the 2009 ESPP.

(1)Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program.  Benefits under the 1996 Program include
stock options intended to qualify for special tax treatment under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code ("incentive stock options"), stock options that do not qualify for that special tax
treatment ("non-qualified stock options"), restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards, and foreign qualified benefits. The shares that remain available for
issuance under the 1996 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards may
be satisfied only from treasury shares).
If
there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 1996 Program without the issuance of shares or
payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the Abbott
Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 1996 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or
pursuant to the payment of the purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not
again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 1996 Program.
In
April 2009, the 1996 Program was replaced by the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program ("2009 Program"). No further awards will be granted
under the 1996 Program.
Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program.  Benefits under the 2009 Program include
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, other share-based awards (including stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards),
awards to non-employee directors, and foreign benefits. The shares that remain available for issuance under the 2009 Program may be issued in connection with any one of these benefits and may be
either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares (except that restricted stock awards are satisfied from treasury shares).
If
there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture or cancellation of any benefit granted under the 2009 Program without the issuance of shares or
payment of cash thereunder, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may again be used for new stock options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009
Program. If shares are issued under any benefit under the 2009 Program and thereafter are reacquired by Abbott pursuant to rights reserved upon their issuance, or pursuant to the payment of the
purchase price of shares under stock options by delivery of other common shares of Abbott, the shares subject to or reserved for that benefit, or so reacquired, may not again be used for new stock
options, rights, or awards of any type authorized under the 2009 Program.
Abbott Laboratories 2009 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-U.S. Employees.  Eligible
employees of participating non-U.S. affiliates of Abbott may participate in this plan. An eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% of eligible compensation (in
multiples of one percent) subject to a limit of US $12,500 during any purchase cycle.

Purchase
cycles are generally six months long and usually begin on August 1 and February 1. On the last day of each purchase cycle, Abbott
uses participant contributions to acquire Abbott common shares. The shares may be either authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares acquired on the open market. The purchase price is
typically 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date or on the first day of that purchase cycle. As the number of shares subject to outstanding options is
indeterminable, columns (a) and (b) of the above table do not include information on the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2016, an aggregate of 2,613,624 common shares
were available for future issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including shares subject to purchase during the current purchase cycle.
(2)Not
included in the table:
Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. Plans.  In 2009, in connection with its acquisition of
Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. ("AMO"), Abbott assumed options outstanding under the AMO's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, and the Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. 2005
Incentive Compensation Plan. As of December 31, 2016, 264,834 options remained outstanding under the plans. These options have a weighted average purchase price of $37.48. No further awards
will be granted under the plans.
St. Jude Medical, Inc. Plans.  In January 2017, in connection with its
acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. ("St. Jude Medical"), Abbott assumed the St. Jude Medical equity incentive plans and the options and restricted stock units

THE PROPOSAL









 



Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman
(Item 7 on Proxy Card)  
 



Mr. Kenneth
Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, New York 11021 has informed Abbott that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that he owns no
fewer than 500 Abbott common shares. 
 
  




  PROPONENT'S STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL



 
 
    Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman     
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require the Chair of the Board of
Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next CEO transition, implemented so it does not violate any
existing agreement. If the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy
within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be
taken to accomplish the above. 
It
will be interesting to see if this proposal receives higher support at Abbott Laboratories in 2017 compared to 2015. The price of Abbott Laboratories stock has been dead money for the 2-years
leading up to the submission of this proposal. 
Caterpillar
opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its June 2016 annual meeting and then reversed itself by naming an independent board chairman in October 2016. Wells
Fargo also reversed itself and named an independent board chairman in October 2016. 
According
to the Institutional Shareholder Services 53% of the Standard & Poors 1,500 firms separate these 2 positions"2015 Board Practices," April 12, 2015. This proposal
topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. 
It
is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to protect shareholders' long-term interests by providing independent oversight of management. By setting agendas, priorities and procedures, the
Chairman is critical in shaping the work of the Board. 
A
board of directors is less likely to provide rigorous independent oversight of management if the Chairman is also the CEO, as is the case with our Company. Having a board chairman who is independent
of management is a practice that will promote greater management accountability to shareholders and lead to a more objective evaluation of management. 
According
to the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance (Yale School of Management), "The independent chair curbs conflicts of interest, promotes oversight of risk, manages the
relationship between the board and CEO, serves as a conduit for regular communication with shareowners, and is a logical next step in the development of an independent board." 
A
number of institutional investors said that a strong, objective board leader can best provide the necessary oversight of management. Thus, the California Public Employees' Retirement System's Global
Principles of Accountable Corporate Governance recommends that a company's board should be chaired by an independent director, as does the Council of Institutional Investors. An independent director
serving as chairman can help ensure the functioning of an effective board.

    Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman     
 
    (Item 7 on Proxy Card)     
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal. 
First, as evidenced by the results of the last six votes on this proposal, Abbott's shareholders support Abbott's current leadership structure. Since
2005, Abbott's shareholders have voted on this proposal six times. In each case, Abbott's shareholders have soundly rejected itwith more than 70% of shares on average voting against the
change. And contrary to the proposal's suggestion, there is no groundswell of support in the United States for an independent Board Chairman. In fact, during the 2016 proxy season, 47 shareholder
proposals calling for independent board chairs reached a vote at Russell 3000 companiesand not a single one passed. 
 Second, the Board believes that the current CEO is best suited to serve as Chairman.    Currently, Mr. White
serves as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. As CEO, Mr. White executes Abbott's business strategies and oversees daily operations. And as Chairman, Mr. White acts
as a bridge between the Board and the business of Abbott. During Mr. White's tenure as both Chairman and CEO, Abbott has executed numerous strategic actions that delivered shareholder value
and positioned Abbott for long-term sustainable growth. For example, for medical devices, through acquiring Guidant in 2006 and St. Jude Medical in 2017, Abbott now competes in nearly every
area of the cardiovascular device market and holds #1 or #2 positions in coronary stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. And for established pharmaceuticals, by
acquiring numerous companies such as Solvay (2010), Piramal (2010), CFR Pharmaceuticals (2014), and Veropharm (2014), and creating Abbott's Established Pharmaceuticals division in 2010, Abbott now
has a critical presence in key emerging markets, in some cases, propelling Abbott into leading positions. Indeed, to focus Abbott's long-term growth, Abbott created two new companies, Hospira (2004)
and AbbVie (2013). Not only has Abbott enhanced its portfolio of businesses during Mr. White's tenure as CEO and Chairman, but also, as explained below, Abbott has strengthened its governance
profile. 
 Third, Abbott's governance system is already carefully balanced to ensure coherent leadership and meaningful oversight.    The shareholder's proposal neither
identifies any concerns specific to Abbott necessitating a change in its corporate governance nor explains how the proposal will promote effective oversight or further the interests of Abbott
shareholders. Indeed, and contrary to the suggestion in the shareholder's proposal, there is no consensus that separating the roles of Chairman and CEO would improve shareholder value. According to
the National Association of Corporate Directors, "no research support[s] the argument that the separation of roles alone creates more effective governance."(1)
And other recent studies likewise find "no statistical relationship between the independence status of the chairman and operating performance."(2) 
In
fact, the proposal overlooks Abbott's existing checks and balances that make an independent Board Chairman redundant. 


 For one, since 2005, Abbott's Board has had an independent Lead Director with the powers to review and approve the Board agenda, communicate
with major shareholders, and call and, in some cases, preside over Board meetings. An independent Lead Director with the powers possessed by Abbott's Lead Director is by itself an acceptable way to
achieve independent board leadership. 
 Additionally, not just most of Abbott's board is independent, but every Board member (other
than the Chairman) is independent per criteria specified by the New York Stock Exchange. And it is this full Board of independent directors that evaluates the CEO's performance every year and
regularly reviews leadership structure. 
 Moreover, the Board's principal committeesthe Audit, Compensation, Nominations and Governance, and Public Policy
Committeesconsist of independent directors exclusively. These committees oversee key matters, including the integrity of Abbott's financial statements, executive compensation, the
nomination of directors, and the evaluation of the Board and key committees.

 Indeed, the Board has repeatedly demonstrated its independence from and oversight of management. In the last few years, the Board has
strengthened its recoupment policy, increased targets for vesting of performance shares for the last two years, adopted a share-retention policy, and increased share-ownership guidelines for
executives and directors. 
 Last, both the Board and its committees can access any unbiased Abbott information they wish. They have unrestrained access to management and
can retain independent advisors as they deem appropriate. 

 Fourth, the shareholder's proposal unnecessarily limits the Board's flexibility to select the best person to serve as Chairman.    It is ultimately part of the
Board's fiduciary duty to decide what leadership structure is in the best interests of Abbott and its shareholders. The Board believes that to carry out this fiduciary obligation, the Board should
be allowed to exercise its judgment, assess Abbott-specific circumstances, and nimbly adopt action in response. In fact, the Board is uniquely qualified to evaluate Abbott's leadership structure
from time to time based upon its extensive experience with and knowledge of Abbott's strategy, operations, management structure, and culture. But the shareholder's mechanical, one-size-fits-all
proposal immoderately limits the Board's ability to do so. Under the shareholder's proposal, regardless the Board's assessment, the quality of Abbott's CEO, or the action most called for by the
situation, Abbott's CEO may never serve as Chairman. The Board believes, however, that Abbott's shareholders are best served when shareholders allow
the Board the flexibility to select the best person for the job. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  APPROVAL PROCESS FOR RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS



 
It is Abbott's policy that the Nominations and Governance Committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott participates
and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related
person transactions requiring review by the Nominations and Governance Committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:


 questionnaires annually distributed to Abbott's directors and officers; 
 certifications submitted annually by Abbott officers related to their compliance with Abbott's Code of Business Conduct; or  
 communications made directly by the related person to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel. 

In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Nominations and Governance Committee will consider the following items, among
others:


 the related person's relationship to Abbott and interest in the transaction; 
 the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of
principal involved; 
 the benefits to Abbott of the transaction; 
 if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; 
 an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees
generally; 
 whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and 
 whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 

This
process is included in the Nominations and Governance Committee's written charter, which is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). The spouse of one of our executive officers, Jaime Contreras, is employed by Abbott. During 2016, her total compensation
exceeded the foregoing threshold.

PROCEDURE FOR RECOMMENDATION AND NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AND TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS AT ANNUAL MEETING









 Proxy Access:    A shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years Abbott common shares representing an aggregate of at
least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, may nominate and have included in Abbott's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided
that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in Abbott's By-Laws. 
Nominating
shareholders are permitted to include in Abbott's proxy statement a 500-word statement in support of their nominee(s). Abbott may omit any information or statement that it, in good faith,

 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    A shareholder may also recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the
names of such persons in writing to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee or the Secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and
confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on:


 the record date for that Annual Meeting, 
 the date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and 
 the date of the Annual Meeting 

may
directly nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the Secretary of Abbott. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    The notice submitted by a shareholder must include certain information required by
Article II of Abbott's By-Laws, including information about the shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or
associates or others acting in concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
For
each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business
at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director nomination, including
through proxy access, the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director, including through proxy access, or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's
principal executive offices not less than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a
date that is not within twenty-five days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on
which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for
the 2018 Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by Abbott no later than January 26, 2018. 
In
addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the Annual Meeting and
as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the Secretary of Abbott at Abbott's principal executive offices not more than five

  DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE STANDARD



 
No director qualifies as "independent" unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Abbott or
its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Abbott or any of its subsidiaries). In making this determination, the board
shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the following standards:


 A director is not independent if the director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries, or an
immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of Abbott or its subsidiaries. 
 A director is not independent if the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period
within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from Abbott or its subsidiaries, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for
prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), and other than amounts received by an immediate family member for service as an employee (other than an
executive officer). 
 A director is not independent if (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is Abbott's internal
or external auditor; (B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and personally works
on Abbott's or its subsidiaries' audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on Abbott's
or its subsidiaries' audit within that time. 
 A director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an
executive officer of another company where any of the present executive officers of Abbott or its subsidiaries at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee.  
 A director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company
that has made payments to, or received payments from, Abbott or its subsidiaries for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of
$1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues. 
 A director is not independent if the director is an executive officer of a charitable organization that received charitable contributions
(other than matching contributions) from Abbott and its subsidiaries in the preceding fiscal year that are in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable organization's
consolidated gross revenues.

  Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program  (Item 5 on Proxy Card)



 
1.    PURPOSE.    The purpose of the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock
Program is to attract and retain outstanding directors, officers and other employees of Abbott Laboratories and its Subsidiaries, and to furnish incentives to such persons by providing opportunities
to acquire common shares of the Company, or monetary payments based on the value of such shares or the financial performance of the Company, or both, on advantageous terms as herein provided and to
further align such persons' interests with those of the Company's other shareholders through compensation that is based on the value of the Company's common shares. 
2.    ADMINISTRATION.    
         (a)    Plan Administrator.    
         The
Program will be administered by the Committee. For purposes of the Program, the "Committee" shall be a committee of at least two persons which shall be either the Compensation
Committee of the Board or such other committee comprised entirely of persons who are both: (i) "non-employee directors" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act; and
(ii) "outside directors" as defined under Code Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee of the Board shall serve as the Committee administering the Program until such time as the Board
designates a different Committee. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and all determinations of the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members. Any
determination of the Committee under the Program may be made without notice of a meeting of the Committee by a writing signed by all of the Committee members. 
         (b)    Powers of the Administrator.    
         The
Committee has the following powers, which it may exercise in its sole discretion, subject to and not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Program: (i) to administer
the Program; (ii) to exercise all the power and authority either specifically granted to it under the Program or necessary or advisable in the administration of the Program; (iii) to
grant Benefits; (iv) to determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which Benefits shall be granted, (v) to determine the type and number of Benefits to be granted, the number
of Shares to which a Benefit may relate and the terms, conditions, restrictions and Performance Goals relating to any Benefit; (vi) to determine whether, to
what extent, and under what circumstances a Benefit may be settled, canceled, forfeited, accelerated (subject to Section 5(b) hereof), exchanged, deferred (in accordance with the requirements
of Code Section 409A) or surrendered; provided that, except in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4(e), the Committee shall neither lower the exercise price or base
price of an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right nor grant any Benefit or provide cash in replacement of a canceled Option or Stock Appreciation Right which had been granted at a higher
exercise price or base price without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders; (vii) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions (including Performance Goals) applicable to
Benefits; (viii) to construe and interpret the Program and any Benefit; (ix) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Program, including any sub-Program
contemplated by Section 10; (x) to determine the terms and provisions of any Benefit Agreement (which need not be identical for each Grantee); and (xi) to make all other
determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Program. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Program or in any
Benefit Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or advisable to carry the Program into effect and shall be the sole and final judge of such necessity or advisability. The
decision of the Committee as to all questions of interpretation, application and administration of the Program shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. No Committee member or delegate
thereof shall be liable for any action taken or determination made, or which the Committee member or delegate fails to take or make, in good faith with respect to the Program or any Benefit. 
         (c)    Delegation of Authority.    
         The
Committee may, from time to time, delegate any or all of its duties, powers and authority to any officer or officers of the Company, except to the extent such delegation would be
inconsistent with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or other applicable law, rule or regulation. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company may grant
Benefits under the Program other than to persons subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act with respect to transactions involving equity securities of the Company at the time that delegated 
​

Laboratories      Exhibit B-1



 
Table of Contents
authority
is exercised. All such grants by the Chief Executive Officer shall be reported annually to the Committee; however, the Committee is not required to take any action with respect to such
grants. 
3.    PARTICIPANTS.    Participants in the Program shall consist of the employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who the Committee in its sole discretion may designate from time to time to receive Benefits, and, solely for purposes of receiving Benefits under
Section 11 and Section 12, Non-Employee Directors of the Company. The Committee's designation of a person to receive a Benefit in any year shall not require the Committee to designate
such person to receive a Benefit in any other year. The Committee shall consider such factors as it deems pertinent in selecting participants and in determining the type and amount of their respective
Benefits. 
4.    SHARES RESERVED UNDER THE PROGRAM AND ADJUSTMENTS.    
         (a)    Share Reserve.    
         Subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 4(e), the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Program is 170,000,000 Shares plus the number of Shares subject to
outstanding awards under the Prior Program that on or after the Effective Date cease to be subject to such awards other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards (to the extent they are
exercised for or settled in vested and non-forfeitable Shares), including due to cash settlement of such Prior Program awards (the "Share Limit"). Each Share issued under the Program pursuant to a
Full Value Award shall be counted against the foregoing Share Limit as three shares for every one share actually issued in connection with such Full Value Award. Such Shares may, in whole or in part,
be authorized but unissued Shares or Shares that shall have been or may be reacquired by the Company in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise; provided, however, that to the extent
required by the Illinois Business Corporations Act of 1983, any fully vested Shares or Restricted Stock issued under the Program shall consist only of Shares that have been reacquired by the Company.
No Benefits shall be granted under the Prior Program after the date of shareholder approval of this Program and any shares previously reserved under the Prior Program in excess of the number of shares
as to which Benefits have been granted under the Prior Program will not become available for issuance under this Program. 
         (b)    Shares Reissuable under Program.    
         If
there is a lapse, expiration, termination, forfeiture, cancellation or cash settlement of any Benefit without the issuance of Shares or if Shares are withheld by the Company to
satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with an applicable taxable event for a Full Value Award granted under the Program or the Prior Program, the Shares reserved for such
Benefit or withheld to satisfy such minimum statutory tax liability, as applicable, may again be used for the grant of new Benefits of any type authorized under this Program. 
         (c)    Shares not Reissuable under Program.    
         Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this Section 4, Shares that are issued under any Benefit and thereafter reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon the
issuance thereof, or pursuant to the payment of the exercise price of Shares under Options by delivery of other Shares, or Shares under Options or stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights that were not
issued upon the net exercise or net settlement of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or Shares repurchased by the Company with the proceeds collected in connection with the exercise of
outstanding Options, and Shares that are exchanged by a Grantee or withheld by the Company to satisfy tax withholding requirements in connection with any Benefit other than a Full Value Award (whether
granted under the Program or the Prior Program) shall not be available for subsequent awards of Benefits. Upon the exercise of any
Benefit granted in tandem with any other Benefits, such related Benefits shall be canceled to the extent of the number of Shares as to which the Benefit is exercised and, notwithstanding the
foregoing, such number of shares shall no longer be available for Benefits. 
         (d)    Limitation on Number of Shares Subject to and Amounts Payable under
Benefits.    
         Subject
to adjustment under Section 4(e), (i) the maximum number of Shares with respect to which Options under Section 6 and Stock Appreciation Rights under
Section 9(a) may be granted to any one participant, in the aggregate in any one calendar year, shall be two million (2,000,000) Shares, and (ii) the maximum number of Shares with respect
to which Full Value Awards that are Performance Awards may be granted to any one participant, in the aggregate in any one calendar year, shall be that number of Shares having a value of
$15 million, determined by multiplying the number of Shares or units granted under the Benefit by the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant, provided that for any performance period
in excess of one year, such maximum value shall be determined by multiplying $15 million by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the performance period and the
denominator of which is twelve. Where it is intended to comply with Code Section 162(m), determinations made in respect of the limitation set forth in this paragraph shall be made in a manner
consistent with Code Section 162(m).

corporate transaction or event, affects the Shares such that an equitable change or adjustment relating to the Program or Benefits is appropriate, then the Committee shall make any such equitable
changes or adjustments as it deems necessary or appropriate, including by way of illustration, changes or adjustments to any or all of (i) the number and kind of Shares or other property
(including cash) that may thereafter be issued in
connection with Benefits, including the Share Limit and the limitations in Section 4(d) hereof, (ii) the number and kind of Shares or other property issued or issuable in respect of
outstanding Benefits, (iii) the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any Benefit, (iv) the Performance Goals, and (v) the individual and other limitations
applicable to Benefits; provided that no such adjustment shall cause any Benefit hereunder which is or becomes subject to Code Section 409A to fail to comply with the requirements of such
section; and provided further that, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, any additional Shares or other securities or property issued with respect to Shares covered by awards granted under
the Program as a result of any stock split, combination, stock dividend, recapitalization or other adjustment event described in this Section 4(e) shall be subject to the restrictions and other
provisions of the original Benefit awarded under the Program. Any adjustment affecting a Benefit intended to comply with Code Section 162(m) shall be made consistent with the requirements of
Code Section 162(m). 
5.    TYPES OF BENEFITS AND MINIMUM VESTING.    
         (a)    Benefits.    
         The
following Benefits, alone or in combination, may be granted under the Program: (i) Options, (ii) Restricted Stock Awards, (iii) Restricted Stock Units,
(iv) Performance Awards, (v) Other Share-Based Awards (including Stock Appreciation Rights, dividend equivalents and recognition awards), (vi) awards to Non-Employee Directors,
and (vii) Foreign Benefits, all as described below. 
         (b)    Minimum Vesting Requirements.    
         Notwithstanding
any other provision of the Program, except in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4(e), no portion of an Award may vest before the first
anniversary of the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in whole or in part as contemplated in Section 13 hereof or otherwise in connection with a Change in Control or upon a participant's
death or disability; provided, however, that the Company may grant Awards with respect to up to five percent (5%) of the number of Shares reserved under Section 4(a) as of the Effective Date
without regard to the minimum vesting period set forth in this Section 5(b). The Committee may accelerate the vesting or exercisability of a Benefit in circumstances other than a Change in
Control or a participant's death or disability, provided that such acceleration does not cause an Award that is subject to the minimum vesting requirements of this Section 5(b) to vest or
become exercisable prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant. 
6.    OPTIONS.    The Committee may grant Options to Grantees which may be subject
to such restrictions, terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion and as shall be evidenced by the applicable Benefit Agreement (provided that any such Benefit is
subject to the vesting requirements described herein and in Section 5(b)). 
         The
Committee shall determine the exercise price for each Share purchasable under an Option, but in no event shall the exercise price per Share be less than the Fair Market Value of a
Share on the Option's date of grant, except in connection with an adjustment provided for in Section 4(e). The exercise price shall be paid in full at the time of exercise; payment may be made
as determined by the Committee, including (1) in cash, which may be paid by check, or other instrument acceptable to the Company; (2) unless otherwise provided in the Benefit Agreement,
in Shares having a then market value equal to the aggregate exercise price (including by withholding Shares that otherwise would be distributed to the Grantee upon exercise of the Option);
(3) delivery of a properly executed exercise notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company the amount of sales proceeds from the Option Shares or
loan proceeds to pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes due to the Company; or (4) by any other method permitted by the Committee. Any amount necessary to satisfy applicable federal,
state or local
tax withholding requirements (or corresponding requirements under applicable laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions) shall be paid promptly upon notification of the amount due. The amount of tax withholding
may be paid in Shares having a then market value equal to the amount required to be withheld (including by withholding Shares that otherwise would be distributed to the Grantee upon exercise of the
Option), or a combination of cash and Shares. 
         An
Option shall be exercisable over its term (which shall not exceed ten (10) years from the date of grant), at such times and upon such conditions as the Committee may determine,
as reflected in the Benefit Agreement. An

Option
may be exercised to the extent of any or all full Shares as to which the Option has become exercisable, by giving written notice of such exercise to the Committee or its designated agent, in
such form as the Committee may prescribe. 
         Except
as otherwise provided in the applicable Benefit Agreement, (i) in the event of termination of employment for any reason other than retirement, disability or death, the
right of the Grantee to exercise an Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the end of the original term of the Option or three (3) months after the Grantee's last day of work for the
Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) in the event of termination of employment due to retirement or disability, or if the Grantee should die while employed, the right of the Grantee or his or her
successor in interest to exercise an Option shall terminate upon the end of the original term of the Option; and (iii) if the Grantee should die within three (3) months after termination
of employment for any reason other than retirement or disability, the right of his or her successor in interest to exercise an Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the end of the original term
of the Option or three (3) months after the date of such death. 
7.    RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.    
         (a)    Restricted Stock Awards.    
         The
Committee may grant Restricted Stock Awards, subject to such restrictions, terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion and as shall be evidenced by
the applicable Benefit Agreement (provided that any such Benefit is subject to the vesting requirements set forth in Section 5(b) above). Subject to Section 5(b), the vesting of a
Restricted Stock Award may be conditioned upon the completion of a specified period of employment or service with the Company or any Subsidiary, upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals,
and/or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. 
         Except
as provided in the applicable Benefit Agreement, no Shares underlying a Restricted Stock Award may be sold, assigned, transferred, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the
Grantee until such Shares have vested in accordance with the terms of such Benefit. 
         If
and to the extent that the applicable Benefit Agreement may so provide, a Grantee shall have the right to vote and receive dividends on Restricted Stock granted under the Program.
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Benefit Agreement, any Shares received as a dividend on or in connection with a stock split of the Shares underlying a Restricted Stock Award awarded under
this Section shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Shares underlying such Restricted Stock Award. 
         Upon
the termination of a Grantee's employment or service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Restricted Stock granted to such Grantee shall be subject to the terms and conditions
specified in the applicable Benefit Agreement. 
         (b)    Restricted Stock Units.    The Committee may grant Restricted
Stock Units, subject to such restrictions, terms and conditions, as the Committee shall determine in its sole discretion and as shall be evidenced by the applicable Benefit Agreement (provided that
any such Restricted Stock Unit is subject to the vesting requirements described in Section 5(b) above). Subject to Section 5(b), the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit granted under the
Program may be conditioned upon the completion of a specified period of employment or service with the Company or any Subsidiary, upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals, and/or upon such
other criteria as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. 
         Unless
otherwise provided in a Benefit Agreement, upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit there shall be delivered to the Grantee, as soon as practicable following the date on which
such Benefit (or any portion thereof) vests, subject to Section 13, that number of Shares equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units that have vested (or the cash equivalent thereof in the
case of a cash-settled award). 
         Except
as provided in the applicable Benefit Agreement, a Restricted Stock Unit may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise encumbered or disposed of by the Grantee. Subject to
the requirements of Code Section 409A, Restricted Stock Units may provide the Grantee with the right to receive dividend equivalent payments with respect to Shares subject to the Benefit (both
before and after the Benefit is earned or vested), which payments may be either made currently or credited to an account for the participant, and may be settled in cash or Shares, as determined by the
Committee. Any such settlements and any such crediting of dividend equivalents may be subject to such conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish, including the
reinvestment of such credited amounts in Share equivalents. 
         Upon
the termination of a Grantee's employment or service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Restricted Stock Units granted to such Grantee shall be subject to the terms and
conditions specified in the applicable Benefit Agreement.

8.    PERFORMANCE AWARDS.    The Committee may grant Benefits including Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Other Share-Based Awards, which, subject to the minimum vesting requirements of Section 5(b) hereof, may be earned in whole or in part based on the attainment
of performance goals established by the Committee (each a "Performance Award"), which shall be based on one or more of the following criteria: earnings per share, return on equity, return on assets,
return on net assets, return on investment, total shareholder return, net operating income, cash flow, increase in revenue, economic value added, increase in share price or cash flow return on
investment, and any combination of, or a specified increase in, any of the foregoing (the "Performance Goals"). Where applicable, the Performance Goals may be expressed in terms of attaining a
specified level of the particular criteria or the attainment of a percentage increase or decrease in the particular criteria, and may be applied to one or more of the Company, a Subsidiary, or a
division or strategic business unit of the Company, or may be applied to the performance of the Company relative to a market index, a group of other companies or a combination thereof, all as
determined by the Committee. The Performance Goals may include a threshold level of performance below which no payment will be made (or no vesting will occur), levels of performance at which specified
payments will be made (or specified vesting will occur), and a maximum level of performance above which no additional payment will be made (or at which full vesting will occur). In addition, partial
achievement of Performance Goals may result in payment or vesting corresponding to the degree of achievement of the Performance Goal. Where necessary to satisfy the requirements of Code
Section 162(m), each of the foregoing Performance Goals shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or such other objective standards satisfying the
requirements of Code Section 162(m), and shall be subject to written certification by the Committee; provided that, to the extent a Benefit is intended to satisfy the performance-based
compensation exception to the limits of Code Section 162(m) and then to the extent consistent with such exception, the Committee may make equitable adjustments to the Performance Goals in
recognition of unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or the financial statements of the Company or any Subsidiary, in response to changes in applicable laws or
regulations, or to account for items of gain, loss or expense determined to be unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a
change in accounting principles. No payment shall be made to a Covered Employee prior to the written certification by the Committee that the Performance Goals have been attained. The Committee may
establish such other rules applicable to Benefits intended to be qualified performance-based compensation to the extent consistent with Code Section 162(m). 
         Payments
earned in respect of any Benefit may be decreased or, with respect to any Grantee who is not a Covered Employee, increased in the sole discretion of the Committee based on such
factors as it deems appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Benefits may be adjusted in accordance with Section 4(e). 
9.    OTHER SHARE-BASED AWARDS AND RECOGNITION AWARDS.    
         (a)    Other Share-Based Awards.    
         The
Committee may grant Other Share-Based Awards, including Stock Appreciation Rights, under terms and conditions specified by the Committee in the applicable Benefit Agreement (subject
to the minimum vesting requirements of Section 5(b) above, if applicable), which may include the attainment of Performance Goals; provided, however, that with respect to a Stock Appreciation
Right, in no event shall (i) the base price per Share be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Stock Appreciation Right's date of grant, except in connection with an adjustment
provided for in Section 4(e), nor (ii) the term of such Stock Appreciation Right exceed ten (10) years from the date of grant. Such terms and conditions shall be consistent with
the terms of the Program. Shares or other securities or property delivered pursuant to a Benefit in the nature of a purchase right granted under this Section 9 shall be purchased for such
consideration, paid for at such times, by such methods, and in such forms, including, without limitation, Shares, other Benefits, notes or other property, as the Committee shall determine, subject to
any required corporate action. 
         (b)    Recognition Awards.    Notwithstanding any provisions to the
contrary, and subject to Section 5(b), the Committee may grant fully vested Shares to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries only if the aggregate number of Shares subject to such awards
granted in any fiscal year to any single individual does not exceed one thousand (1,000) Shares. 
10.    FOREIGN BENEFITS.    The Committee may grant Benefits to employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who reside in foreign jurisdictions. Notwithstanding anything in the Program to the contrary, each of the Committee and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the
Executive Vice President, Human Resources, may, in its or his sole discretion: (a) amend or vary the terms of the Program in order to conform such terms with the requirements of each
jurisdiction where a Subsidiary is located; (b) amend or vary the terms of the Program in each jurisdiction where a Subsidiary is located as it or he considers necessary or desirable to take
into account or to mitigate or reduce the burden of taxation and social security contributions for Participants and/or the Subsidiary (including, without limitation, determining comparable minimum
withholding liability under applicable non-U.S. tax

laws
for purposes of Section 4(b)); or (c) amend or vary the terms of the Program in a jurisdiction where the Subsidiary is located as it or he considers necessary or desirable to meet
the goals and objectives of the Program. Each of the Committee and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, may, where it deems appropriate in its
or his sole discretion, establish one or more sub-Programs for these purposes. The Committee and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, may, in
its or his sole discretion, establish administrative rules and procedures to facilitate the operation of the Program in such jurisdictions. The terms and conditions contained herein which are subject
to variation in a jurisdiction shall be reflected in a written attachment to the Program for each Subsidiary in such jurisdiction. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Committee may
delegate its authority and responsibilities under this Section 10 to one or more officers of the Company. In this regard and to the extent permitted under applicable law, the Committee hereby
delegates its authority and responsibilities under this Section 10 to the Executive Vice President, Human Resources. 
11.    OPTIONS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.    Each Non-Employee Director may elect to
receive any or all of his or her fees earned under Section 3 of the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan (the "Directors' Fee Plan") in the form of Options under this Section.
Each such election shall be irrevocable, and must be made in writing and filed with the Secretary of the Company by December 31 of the calendar year preceding the period in which such fees are
earned. A Non-Employee Director may file a new election each calendar year applicable to fees earned in the immediately succeeding calendar year, provided that a new election to receive
benefits in the form of Options shall not be effective until the period covered by the Non-Employee Director's current election has ended. If no new election is received by December 31 of any
calendar year, the election, if any, then in effect shall continue in effect until a new election is made and has become effective. If a director does not elect to receive his or her fees in the form
of Options, the fees due such director shall be paid or deferred as provided in the Directors' Fee Plan and any applicable election thereunder by the director. 
         Each
Option due to a director under this Program pursuant to an election shall be granted annually, on the date of the annual shareholders meeting. Except as otherwise provided, each
such Option shall be (A) subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6, (B) immediately exercisable and non-forfeitable and (C) exercisable until the expiration of ten
(10) years from the date of grant. 
12.    RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.    Each year, on the date
of the annual shareholders meeting, each person who is elected a Non-Employee Director at the annual shareholders meeting shall be awarded Restricted Stock Units covering the amount set by the Board
in its sole discretion, upon recommendation by the Committee; provided, however that the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of the award shall not exceed $250,000. 
         The
Restricted Stock Units granted to Non-Employee Directors shall be fully vested on the date of the award, subject to Section 5(b), and shall be awarded and/or issued or paid in
a manner that will comply with Code Section 409A. Subject to the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Non-Employee Director receiving the Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to
receive one Share for each Restricted Stock Unit upon the earliest of (A) the director's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A); (B) the date the
director dies; or (C) the date of occurrence of a Change in Control that also qualifies as a "change in control event" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)). 
         Subject
to the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Non-Employee Director receiving the Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to receive cash payments equal to the dividends
and distributions paid on the Shares (other than dividends or distributions of securities of the Company which may be issued with respect to its shares by virtue of any stock split, combination, stock
dividend or recapitalization) to the same extent as if each Restricted Stock Unit was a Share, and those shares were not subject to the restrictions imposed by this Program, provided that the record
date with respect to such dividend or distribution occurs within the period commencing with the date of grant of the Benefit and ending upon the earliest of (A) the date of the director's
death, (B) the date of the director's "separation from service" (within the meaning of Code Section 409A), or (C) the date of the occurrence of a Change in Control that also
qualifies as a "change in control event" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)). 
         While
outstanding, the Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. 
         Except
in the event of conflict, all provisions of the Program shall apply to this Section 12. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Program and this
Section 12, this Section 12 shall control.

13.    CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS.    
         (a)    Treatment of Benefits Upon a Change in Control.    
         Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Program, the following provisions shall apply upon the occurrence of a Change in Control unless otherwise provided in a Benefit Agreement: 

            (i)  All
Options then outstanding under this Program shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control, whether or not then otherwise vested
or exercisable; 
           (ii)  All
Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Share-Based Awards then outstanding shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control, whether
or not then otherwise vested or exercisable; 
          (iii)  All
terms and conditions of all Restricted Stock Awards then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied and all restrictions on those Restricted Stock Awards will lapse as
of the date of the Change in Control; 
          (iv)  All
terms and conditions of all Restricted Stock Units then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied, all restrictions on those Restricted Stock Units will lapse and the
Restricted Stock Units shall be immediately payable as of the date of the Change in Control; and 
           (v)  All
performance criteria shall be deemed to have been attained and all Performance Awards then outstanding shall be deemed to have been fully earned and to be
immediately payable as of the date of the Change in Control. 

         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to each Benefit that is subject to Code Section 409A, if a Change in Control would have occurred under the Program but such Change in
Control does not also qualify as a "change in control event" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), then each such Benefit shall become vested and non-forfeitable;
provided, however, that the Grantee shall not be able to exercise the Benefit, and the Benefit shall not become payable, except in accordance with the terms of such Benefit or until such earlier time
as the exercise and/or payment complies with Code Section 409A. 
         (b)    Determination of Occurrence of a Change in Control.    
         A
"Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred on the earliest of the following dates: 

            (i)  The
date any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner (as defined below), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities
beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its Affiliates) representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
securities, excluding any Person who becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a transaction described in clause (a) of paragraph (iii) below; or 
           (ii)  The
date the following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, on the date hereof,
constitute the Board and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a
consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved or
recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or whose appointment, election or nomination for
election was previously so approved or recommended; or 
          (iii)  The
date on which there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company with any other corporation or
other entity, other than (a) a merger or consolidation
(I) immediately following which the individuals who comprise the Board immediately prior thereto constitute at least a majority of the board of directors of the Company, the entity surviving
such merger or consolidation or, if the Company or the entity surviving such merger is then a Subsidiary, the ultimate parent thereof and (II) which results in the voting securities of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or
any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, at least 50%
of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (b) a merger or
consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its

Affiliates)
representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or 
          (iv)  The
date the shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or
disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an entity, at
least 50% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by shareholders of the Company, in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding
securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale. 

         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred by virtue of the consummation of any transaction or series of integrated transactions immediately
following which the record holders
of the common shares of the Company immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership in an entity which owns all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company immediately following such transaction or series of transactions. 
         For
purposes of this Program: "Affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; "Beneficial Owner" shall have the meaning set
forth in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act; "Person" shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as modified and as used in Section 13(d) and 14(d)
thereof and the rules thereunder, except that such term shall not include (1) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (2) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an
employee benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary, (3) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (4) a corporation owned, directly
or indirectly, by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company; and "Subsidiary" shall mean any corporation, partnership, joint
venture or business trust, fifty percent (50%) or more of the control of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company. 
         (c)    Assumption of Benefits.    
         In
the event that, in connection with a Change in Control, outstanding Benefits under the Program are either assumed or converted into substituted Benefits, each such assumed or
substituted Benefit shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions to which it was subject immediately prior to the transaction resulting in the assumption or substitution. 
         (d)    Grantee Election in Certain Transactions.    
         Upon
a Change in Control in which the outstanding Shares are changed into, or exchanged for, property (including cash) other than solely stock or securities of the Company or another
corporation (disregarding, for this purpose, cash paid in lieu of fractional shares), each Grantee may elect to receive, immediately following such Change in Control in exchange for cancellation of
any Option or Stock Appreciation Right held by such Grantee immediately prior to the Change in Control, a cash payment, with respect to each Share subject to such Option or right, equal to the
difference between the value of consideration (as determined by the Committee) received by the shareholders for a Share in the Change in Control, less any applicable purchase price. 
14.    GENERAL PROVISIONS.    
         (a)    Nontransferability, Deferrals and Settlements.    Unless
otherwise determined by the Committee or provided in a Benefit Agreement, Benefits shall not be transferable by a Grantee except by will or the laws of descent and distribution and shall be
exercisable during the lifetime of a Grantee only by such Grantee or his guardian or legal representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transfer of Benefits to independent third parties for cash
consideration without shareholder approval is prohibited. Any Benefit shall be null and void and without effect upon any attempted assignment or transfer, except as herein provided, including without
limitation any purported assignment, whether voluntary or by operation of law, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition, attachment, divorce, trustee process or similar process, whether legal or
equitable, upon such Benefit. With respect to Benefits other than Options, the Committee may require or permit Grantees to elect to defer the issuance of Shares (with settlement in cash or Shares as
may be determined by the Committee or elected by the Grantee in accordance with procedures established by the Committee), or the settlement of Benefits in cash under such rules and procedures as
established under the Program to the extent that such deferral complies with Code Section 409A and any Treasury Regulations or
guidance promulgated thereunder. It may also provide that such deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest, dividends or dividend equivalents on the deferral amounts. 
         (b)    No Right to Continued Employment, etc.    Nothing in the
Program or in any Benefit granted or any Benefit Agreement or other agreement entered into pursuant hereto shall confer upon any Grantee the right to continue in the employ or service of the Company,
any Subsidiary or to be entitled to any remuneration or benefits 
​

​



 
Table of Contents
not
set forth in the Program or such Benefit Agreement or other agreement or to interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any such Subsidiary to terminate such Grantee's
employment or service. 
         (c)    Sale of Subsidiary.    For all purposes hereunder, except as
otherwise provided by the Committee, a Grantee's employment or service with a Subsidiary shall be deemed to be terminated on the day such entity ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company. 
         (d)    Taxes.    The Company shall be entitled to withhold, or require
a participant to remit to the Company, the amount of any tax attributable to any amount payable or shares deliverable under the Program. The Company may defer making payment or delivery if any such
tax may be pending unless and until indemnified to its satisfaction, and the Company shall have no liability to any participant for exercising the foregoing right. The Committee may, in its sole
discretion and subject to such rules as it may adopt, permit or require a Grantee to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local taxes (in U.S. or non-U.S. jurisdictions), including social
security and Medicare withholding tax, arising in connection with the receipt or exercise of any Benefit by, without limitation: (i) having the Company withhold Shares, (ii) tendering
Shares received in connection with such Benefit back to the Company, (iii) delivering other previously acquired Shares having a Fair Market Value approximately equal to the amount to be
withheld, (iv) selling Shares issued pursuant to such Benefit and having the Company withhold from proceeds of the sale of such Shares, (v) having the Company or a Subsidiary, as
applicable, withhold from any cash compensation payable to the Grantee, or (vi) requiring the Grantee to repay the Company or Subsidiary, in cash or in Shares, for taxes paid on the Grantee's
behalf. 
         (e)    Amendment and Termination.    The Program may be amended or
terminated at any time by action of the Board. However, no amendment may, without shareholder approval: (i) increase the aggregate number of Shares available for Benefits (except to reflect an
event described in Section 4(e)); (ii) extend the term of the Program; or (iii) change or add a category or categories of individuals who are eligible to participate in the
Program. If the Program is not, within twelve months of the Effective Date, approved by a majority of the shares voted at a regular or special meeting of the Company's shareholders, the Program will
terminate and all Benefits made under it will be canceled. No amendment or termination of the Program (other than termination under Section 14(f) below) may materially and adversely modify any
person's rights under the express terms and conditions of an outstanding Benefit without such person's written consent, except that the Committee may amend the Program in accordance with
Section 10 above, or to qualify for or comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board or Committee deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply
including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 14(m) hereof. 
         (f)    Duration of Program.    Unless earlier terminated by the Board
pursuant to the provisions of the Program, the Program shall expire on the tenth (10th) anniversary of its Effective Date. No Benefits shall be granted under the Program after such date. 
         (g)    No Rights to Benefits; No Shareholder Rights.    No individual
shall have any claim to be granted any Benefit under the Program, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Grantees. No individual shall have any right to a Benefit or to payment or
settlement under any Benefit unless and until the Committee or its designee shall have determined that a Benefit or payment or settlement is to be made. Except as provided specifically herein, a
Grantee or a transferee of a Benefit shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by the Benefit until the date of the issuance of such Shares. 
         (h)    Unfunded Status of Benefits.    The Program is intended to
constitute an "unfunded" plan for purposes of incentive and deferred compensation. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Grantee pursuant to a Benefit, nothing contained in the Program or any
Benefit shall give any such Grantee any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company. 
         (i)    No Fractional Shares.    No fractional Shares shall be issued
or delivered pursuant to the Program or any Benefit. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Benefits, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether
such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
         (j)    Regulations and Other Approvals.    The obligation of the
Company to sell or deliver Shares with respect to any Benefit shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable securities laws, and the obtaining of all such
approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee. 
         (k)    Listing, Registration or Qualification of Shares.    Each
Benefit is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares issuable pursuant to the Program
is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law (or

corresponding
requirements under applicable laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions), or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in
connection with, the grant of a Benefit or the issuance of Shares, no such Benefit shall be granted or payment made or Shares issued, in whole or in part, unless listing, registration, qualification,
consent or approval has been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee. 
         (l)    Restricted Securities.    If the disposition of Shares acquired
pursuant to the Program is not covered by a then current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, then such
Shares shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required by the Securities Act or regulations thereunder and the Committee may require a Grantee receiving Shares pursuant to the Program, as
a condition precedent to receipt of such Shares, to represent to the Company in writing that the Shares acquired by such Grantee is acquired for investment only and not with a view to distribution. 
         (m)    Section 409A.    To the extent applicable, the Program
and Benefit Agreements shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Treasury Regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation
any such Treasury Regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the date the Program became effective (collectively, "Code Section 409A"). Notwithstanding any provision of the Program,
to the extent that any Benefit would be subject to Code Section 409A, no such Benefit may be granted if it would fail to comply with the requirements set forth in Code Section 409A. To
the extent that the Committee determines that the Program or any Benefit is subject to Code Section 409A and fails to comply with or be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Program or in any Benefit Agreement, the Committee reserves the right to amend or terminate the Program and/or amend, restructure, terminate
or replace the Benefit, without the consent of the Grantee, to cause the Benefit to either be exempt from Code Section 409A or to comply with the applicable provisions of such section. Further,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Program, to the extent permitted by and in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(C)(1), the Committee may
extend the maximum term of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right as may be necessary to allow for the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right for up to thirty days following a period
during which the exercise would have violated an applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law. In addition, to the extent a Benefit subject to Code Section 409A is payable upon a termination
of employment or service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, such termination shall be deemed to have occurred under the Program with respect to such Benefit on the first day on which an individual
has experienced a "separation from service" within the meaning of Code
Section 409A; further, with respect to any such Benefit, if the Grantee is one of the Company's "specified employees" under Code Section 409A at the time of the Grantee's separation from
service, any payment that otherwise would be made to such Grantee during the first six (6) months on or following his or her separation from service shall not be made until the date that is six
(6) months and one (1) day after such separation from service, except to the extent that earlier payment would not result in such Grantee's incurring interest or additional tax under
Code Section 409A. 
         (n)    No Representations or Covenants with respect to Tax
Qualification.    Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify an Benefit for favorable or specific tax treatment under the laws of the United States or
jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Code Section 409A), the Company makes no
representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, anything to the contrary in this Program, including Section 14(m)
hereof, notwithstanding. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on holders of Benefits under the Program. Nothing in this
Program or in a Benefit Agreement shall provide a basis for any person to take any action against the Company or any Subsidiary based on matters covered by Section 409A of the Code, including
the tax treatment of any Benefits, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will have any liability under any circumstances to the Grantee or any other party if the Benefit that is intended to be
exempt from, or compliant with, Section 409A of the Code, is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. 
         (o)    Recoupment Policy.    
         Any
Benefit granted pursuant to this Program is subject to the terms and conditions of the Abbott Laboratories Recoupment Policy, as amended from time to time (the "Policy"), solely in
its application to an employee whom the Company has determined, in accordance with its regular practice, is an "officer" as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Any Benefit (including
Benefits that have vested) shall be subject to any recoupment that is required under applicable laws, rules, regulations, or stock exchange listing standards. 
         (p)    Governing Law.    The Program and all determinations made and
actions taken pursuant hereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof. Each participant hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal courts in and the state courts of the State of

statute, rule, regulation, or official guidance thereunder, shall be construed as a reference to such law, statute, rule, regulation, or official guidance, as the same may be amended, from time to
time, or any successor provision to such law, statute, rule, regulation or official guidance.

shall mean each Subsidiary that has been designated by the Administrator or its delegate as eligible to participate in the Plan with respect to its Employees.

3.    Eligibility.    Any person who is an Employee during the Enrollment Period, other than an officer
or director of the Company, shall be eligible to enroll and participate in the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Employer may
prospectively condition participation by an Employee upon a period of service with such Employer. 
4.    Participation and Withdrawal.    
         4.1    Enrollment.    An eligible Employee may become a Participant with respect to an upcoming Purchase Cycle by
filing with his Employer during the Enrollment Period preceding the Offering Date a completed authorization and enrollment form, or by following an IVR, electronic or other enrollment process as
prescribed by his Employer. Unless otherwise determined by his Employer, an eligible Employee who fails to follow the prescribed procedures to enroll in the Plan on or before the enrollment deadline
for such Offering Date shall not participate in the Plan with respect to that Purchase Cycle, but instead may participate in the next following Purchase Cycle. Under procedures established by his
Employer, a Participant's authorization and enrollment form shall continue in effect from one Purchase Cycle
to the next, unless the Participant suspends his payroll deductions or contributions or discontinues his participation in accordance with Section 4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employer
may permit a new Employee who commences employment as a result of a merger, acquisition, purchase of assets or business, spin-off, or other corporate transaction involving the Employer, to become a
Participant during the Purchase Cycle in which he becomes a new Employee, in accordance with such procedures and enrollment process as prescribed by the Employer. 
         4.2    Payroll Deductions/Contributions.    
                 (a)    An
eligible Employee may authorize payroll deductions at the rate of 1% to 10% (or such other maximum percentage as specified by the Administrator), in whole
percentages only, of the Employee's Eligible Compensation. Where payroll deductions are prohibited under local law, an Employer may permit its Employees to contribute to the Plan by an alternative
method of contribution, including (but not limited to) personal checks or direct debits from personal banking accounts. Payroll deductions or contributions shall commence as of the Offering Date and
as soon as administratively practicable following the date on which the eligible Employee completes the enrollment process, subject to any approvals or other requirements under local law. Each
Employer may use the payroll deductions or contributions of its Participants for any corporate purpose, except where prohibited by local law. Neither the Company nor the Employer shall be obligated to
segregate such payroll deductions or contributions, except as required by local law. 
                 (b)   Each
Employer shall maintain a separate bookkeeping account, or other type of account if required by local law, for each of its Employees who participate in the Plan
and shall credit to that account all payroll deductions or contributions made by or on behalf of the Employee pursuant to Section 4.2(a). No interest shall be paid or credited to the account of
any Participant except where required by local law. 
                 (c)    Unless
otherwise prohibited under local law or unless alternative procedures are established by the Administrator in its sole discretion, each Employer shall convert
the payroll deductions or contributions of its Participants paid in non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars as soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable payroll deduction date. Each Employer
shall hold such amounts in U.S. dollars until the end of the applicable Purchase Cycle when such amounts shall be forwarded to the Company for the purchase of Common Shares for Participants on the
Purchase Date. 
                 (d)   Subject
to Section 4.2(a) and such other limitations and requirements, if any, as prescribed by his Employer, a Participant may prospectively increase or
decrease the rate of payroll deductions or contributions at any time by filing a new authorization with his Employer or by following IVR, electronic or other procedures prescribed by his Employer.
Such increase or decrease shall become effective as of the next Purchase Cycle. If a Participant fails to follow such procedures to change the rate of payroll deductions or contributions, the rate of
payroll deductions or contributions shall remain unchanged at the originally elected rate throughout the Purchase Cycle and future Purchase Cycles, unless reduced to reflect a change by the
Administrator in the maximum permissible rate. 
         4.3    Suspension of Payroll Deductions/Contributions or Discontinuance of Participation.    
                 (a)    Under
procedures established by his Employer, a Participant may suspend payroll deductions or contributions, or discontinue participation under the Plan, at any time
during a Purchase Cycle by completing and 
​
Exhibit
C-2      Abbott Laboratories
​



 
Table of Contents
filing
an authorization form with his Employer, or by following IVR, electronic or other procedures prescribed by his Employer. Such suspension or discontinuance shall become effective as soon as
administratively practicable. 
                 (b)   Upon
the suspension of payroll deductions or contributions during a Purchase Cycle, the amount credited to the Participant's account as of the date of suspension shall
be used to purchase Common Shares pursuant to Section 6 of the Plan. A Participant who suspends payroll deductions or contributions during a Purchase Cycle shall not be entitled to participate
in any future Purchase Cycle and shall have no additional amounts withheld or contributed until he completes a new authorization with his Employer for a subsequent Purchase Cycle or otherwise complies
with his Employer's enrollment process in accordance with the enrollment procedures set forth in Section 4.1. 
                 (c)    Upon
the Participant's discontinuation of participation during a Purchase Cycle, the amount credited to the Participant's account shall be refunded as soon as
administratively practicable without interest (unless otherwise required by local law). Such Participant shall be ineligible to participate in the Plan until he re-enrolls in the Plan for a subsequent
Purchase Cycle in accordance with the enrollment procedures set forth in Section 4.1. 
         4.4    Termination of Employment.    If a Participant terminates employment with his Employer for any reason
(including death, disability or retirement) prior to the expiration of a Purchase Cycle, the Participant's participation in the Plan shall immediately terminate, and the amount credited to the
Participant's account shall be refunded to the Participant or the Participant's estate without interest (unless otherwise required by local law) as soon as administratively practicable. Each Employer
in its discretion shall determine whether its Employees have terminated employment for purposes of the Plan, and such determinations shall be final and binding on all parties. Each Employer also may
establish rules regarding when a leave of absence or other changes of employment status will be considered to be a termination of employment with respect to its Employees for purposes of the Plan. 
5.    Offering.    
         5.1    Authorized Shares.    Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 8 of the Plan, the maximum number of
Common Shares that may be issued pursuant to the Plan shall be Fifteen Million (15,000,000) shares, which includes the number of Common Shares that remain available for future issuance, as of the date
the shareholders of the Company approve the Plan, under the 2009 Plan. Such shares may be authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares purchased on the open market, or a combination of
each, as determined from time to time by the Board. If any purchase right granted shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject to that
purchase right shall again become available for purposes of the Plan. If on any Purchase Date the number of shares otherwise purchasable by Participants is greater than the number of shares then
remaining available under the Plan, the Administrator shall allocate the available shares among the Participants in such manner as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion. To the extent permitted
under applicable stock exchange rules, shares may be purchased pursuant to a formula under sub-plans without regard to the limits of this Section 5.1. 
         5.2    Purchase Cycles.    Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, including with respect to a particular
jurisdiction, Subsidiary, or sub-plan: (a) the duration of each Purchase Cycle shall be six consecutive calendar months; (b) each Purchase Cycle shall commence on January 1 or
July 1; and (c) subsequent Purchase Cycles shall run consecutively after each preceding Purchase Cycle. Except where prohibited by applicable law, the Administrator shall have the power
to make any such changes without Board approval, and without regard to the expectations of any Participants; provided, however, that the Company and/or Employer shall notify Participants of any such
change at least 30 days before such change becomes effective. 
         5.3    Grant of Purchase Right.    On each Offering Date, each Participant who has timely enrolled in a Purchase Cycle
in accordance with Section 4.1 shall be granted the right to purchase that number of Common Shares which may be purchased with the balance credited to the Participant's account as of the
applicable Purchase Date. 
         5.4    Purchase Cycle Limitation.    Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant
may contribute more than the equivalent in local currency of US$12,500 during each Purchase Cycle towards the purchase of Common Shares under the Plan. Any amounts contributed in excess of this
limitation shall be carried over to the immediately following Purchase Cycle, or shall be refunded to the Participant, as the Employer in its sole discretion shall determine. 
6.    Purchase of Shares.    
         6.1    Automatic Purchase of Shares.    Unless a Participant has previously ceased participation in the Plan during a
Purchase Cycle, a Participant's purchase right shall be automatically exercised on each Purchase Date to purchase that number of full Common Shares which the balance credited to the Participant's
account shall entitle him to purchase. Any cash remaining in a Participant's account after the purchase of Common Shares may, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, be applied to purchase a
notional interest in a fractional Common Share, and shall 
​

Laboratories      Exhibit C-3
​



 
Table of Contents
remain
in the Participant's account. Upon distribution of a Participant's account, any interest in a fractional Common Share will be paid in cash. 
         6.2    Purchase Price.    The purchase price for a single Common Share for each Purchase Cycle shall be 85% of the
lesser of: (a) the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the Offering Date; and (b) the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the Purchase Date. 
7.    Payment and Delivery.    
         7.1    Direct Deposit of Shares.    Unless and until otherwise determined by the Administrator, all Common Shares
purchased under the Plan on the Purchase Date shall be deposited directly into an account established in the name of each Participant with a broker or agent designated by the Administrator. Upon the
purchase and allocation of Common Shares, each Employer shall deliver (by electronic or other means) to its Participants a record of the Common Shares credited to the Participant's account. The
Administrator may authorize the broker or agent to utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer for these purposes. 
         7.2    Mandatory Retention of Shares.    Before the commencement of any Purchase Cycle, the Administrator may require
that: (a) any Common Shares purchased under the Plan during such Purchase Cycle be retained with a designated broker or agent for a designated period of time (and may restrict dispositions
during that period) and/or may establish other procedures to restrict transfer of such Common Shares; and/or (b) Common Shares purchased under the Plan automatically participate in a dividend
reinvestment plan or program maintained by the Company. 
         7.3    Fully-Paid and Non-Assessable.    The Company shall retain the amount of payroll deductions or contributions
transmitted by each Employer and used to purchase Common Shares as full payment for the Common Shares, and the Common Shares shall then be fully paid and non-assessable. 
         7.4    No Voting or Dividend Rights.    No Participant shall have any voting, dividend, or other shareholder rights
with respect to Common Shares subject to any purchase right under the Plan until the Common Shares have been purchased and delivered to the Participant or into an account for the benefit of the
Participant, as provided in this Section 7. 
8.    Recapitalization.    
         8.1    In General.    If after the grant of a purchase right, but prior to the purchase of Common Shares with respect
to a particular Purchase Cycle, there is any increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Common Shares because of a stock split, stock dividend, combination or recapitalization, the
Administrator in its sole discretion shall make any such substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems appropriate, with respect to: (a) the maximum number and kind of Common Shares specified
in Section 5.1; (b) the purchase price per Common Share and the number of Common Shares covered by each outstanding purchase right; and (c) any other limitations provided under
this Plan. The Administrator shall take any further actions which, in the exercise of its discretion, may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances. 
         8.2    Adjustments.    In the event the Company effects one or more reorganizations, recapitalizations, spinoffs,
split-ups, rights offerings or reductions of its outstanding Common Shares, the Administrator in its sole discretion may make any such substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems appropriate, with
respect to: (a) the number and kind of shares specified in Section 5.1, (b) the purchase price per Common Share and the number of Common Shares covered by each outstanding
purchase right, and (c) any other limitations provided under this Plan. 
         8.3    Binding Decisions.    The determinations of the Administrator under this Section 8 shall be conclusive
and binding on all parties. 
9.    Merger, Liquidation, Other Company Transactions.    
         9.1    Liquidation or Dissolution.    In the event of the proposed liquidation or dissolution of the Company, the
Purchase Cycle then in progress shall terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed liquidation or dissolution, unless otherwise provided by the Administrator in its sole
discretion, and all outstanding purchase rights shall automatically terminate and the amounts of all payroll deductions or employee contributions will be refunded without interest (unless otherwise
required under local law) to the Participants as soon as reasonably practicable. 
         9.2    Sale or Merger.    In the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or
the merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, then in the sole discretion of the Administrator: (a) each purchase right shall be assumed, or an equivalent purchase
right shall be substituted, by the successor corporation or parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation; or (b) a new Purchase Date shall be 
​

​



 
Table of Contents
established
by the Administrator on or before the date of consummation of such merger, consolidation or sale, and all outstanding purchase rights shall be automatically exercised on such new date. 
10.    Transferability.    Purchase rights granted to Participants may not be voluntarily or
involuntarily assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise disposed of in any way, and are exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant. Any attempted assignment, transfer,
pledge, or other disposition of a purchase right hereunder shall be null and void and without effect. If a Participant in any manner attempts to transfer, assign or otherwise encumber his or her
rights or interest under the Plan, such act shall be treated as an election by the Participant to discontinue participation in the Plan pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Plan. 
11.    Amendment or Termination of the Plan.    
         11.1    Term of Plan.    The Plan shall continue until July 31, 2027, unless previously terminated in
accordance with Section 11.2. 
         11.2    Amendment and Termination.    The Board may amend the Plan from time to time as it deems desirable in its sole
discretion without approval of the shareholders of the Company, except to the extent shareholder approval is required by Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
applicable New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange rules, or other applicable laws or regulations. The Board may terminate or suspend the Plan at any time in its sole discretion, including
shortening a Purchase Cycle and establishing a new Purchase Date for such Purchase Cycle for some or all Participants in connection with a spin-off or other similar corporate event. The termination,
suspension or amendment of the Plan shall not alter or impose rights or obligations under any purchase right theretofore granted under the Plan in any material adverse way without the consent of the
affected Participants, unless such termination, suspension or amendment is necessary or advisable to qualify for or comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board
deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply, including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 18 hereof. 
12.    Administration.    The Administrator shall have the power, authority and responsibility for the
day-to-day administration of the Plan, the power, authority and responsibility specifically provided in this Plan, and any additional duties and responsibilities approved by the Board. To the extent
permitted under applicable law, the Administrator may delegate its power, authority and responsibilities under the Plan to one or more officers of the Company at any time in its sole discretion. The
Administrator and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, its delegate, shall have full power and authority to promulgate any rules and regulations which are deemed necessary for the proper
administration of the Plan, to interpret the provisions and supervise the administration of the Plan, to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the terms of the
Plan and any enrollment form or other instrument or agreement relating to the Plan, to make factual determinations relevant to Plan entitlements and to take all action in connection with
administration of the Plan as deemed necessary or advisable. Decisions of the Administrator and, where applicable, its delegate, shall be final and binding upon all Participants. The Company shall pay
all reasonable expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan. Neither the Administrator nor any delegate of the Administrator shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith
with respect to the Plan or any purchase right granted hereunder. 
13.    Rules for Certain Jurisdictions.    Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary other
than Section 11.1, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion: (a) amend or vary the terms of the Plan in order to conform such terms with the requirements of each jurisdiction where
an Employer is located; (b) amend or vary the terms of the Plan in each jurisdiction where an Employer is located as it considers necessary or desirable to take into account or to mitigate or
reduce the burden of taxation and social security contributions for Participants and/or the Employer; or (c) amend or vary the terms of the Plan in a jurisdiction where the Employer is located
as it considers necessary or desirable to meet the goals and objectives of the Plan. The Administrator may, where it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, establish one or more sub-plans for these
purposes. Without limitation to the above, the Abbott Laboratories, Limited Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Abbott Laboratories Employee Share Ownership Plan shall each constitute a sub-plan to
the Plan. The Administrator may, in its sole discretion, establish administrative rules and procedures to facilitate the operation of the Plan in such jurisdictions. The terms and conditions contained
herein which are subject to variation in a jurisdiction shall be reflected in a written attachment to the Plan for each Employer in such jurisdiction, or shall be otherwise documented in such manner
as may be prescribed by the Administrator. To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Administrator may delegate its authority and responsibilities under this Section 13 to one or more
officers of the Company. 
14.    Compliance with Legal and Exchange Requirements.    The Company shall not be under any
obligation to issue Common Shares upon the exercise of any purchase right unless and until the Company has determined that: (a) it and the Participant have taken all actions required to
register the Common Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, or to perfect an exemption from the registration requirements thereof; (b) any applicable listing requirement of any

stock
exchange on which the Common Shares are listed has been satisfied; and (c) all other applicable provisions of U.S. federal, state, local and applicable non-U.S. law have been satisfied. 
15.    Governmental Approvals.    This Plan and the Company's obligation to sell and deliver shares of
Common Shares under the Plan in any jurisdiction shall be subject to approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the Plan or the authorization, issuance, sale, or delivery of
Common Shares hereunder in such jurisdiction. 
16.    No Enlargement of Employee Rights.    Nothing contained in this Plan shall be deemed to give any
Employee the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or an Employer or to interfere with the right of the Company or an Employer to discharge any Employee at any time. Any rights or benefits
provided under this Plan shall not be considered part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments, bonuses, long
service awards, pension, retirement or similar payments. 
17.    Withholding Taxes.    In the event that the Company or an Employer is required to withhold any
applicable taxes in respect of any compensation or other income realized by a Participant under the Plan, the Company or such Employer may deduct from any benefits of any kind otherwise due to such
Participant, including without limitation the proceeds of any sale of Common Shares for the account of the Participant, the aggregate amount of such applicable taxes required to be withheld or, if
such payments are insufficient to satisfy such applicable taxes, the Participant will be required to pay to the Company or such Employer, or make other arrangement satisfactory to the Company or such
Employer regarding payment to the Company or such Employer of, the aggregate amount of any such taxes. 
18.    Code Section 409A.    Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, if the
Administrator determines that a purchase right granted under the Plan to a Participant who is subject to U.S. federal income tax may be subject to Section 409A of the Code or that any provision
in the Plan would cause such a purchase right under the Plan to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Administrator may amend the terms of the Plan and/or of the outstanding purchase
right or take such other action the Administrator determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant's consent, to exempt the outstanding purchase right or future purchase
right that may be granted under the Plan from, or to allow any such purchase rights to comply with Section 409A of the Code, provided that any such amendment or action by the Administrator
would not violate Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the purchase right under the Plan that is
intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Administrator with respect thereto. The Company makes no
representation that any purchase right under the Plan is compliant with Section 409A of the Code. 
19.    Governing Law.    This Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Illinois, without regard to conflicts of law principles. Each sub-plan established pursuant to Section 13 of the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
of the applicable jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided in such sub-plan document. 
20.    Severability.    If any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid in any
jurisdiction, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan in such jurisdiction, or any provision of the Plan in any other jurisdiction, and the Plan shall be
construed and applied in such jurisdiction as if the invalid provision had never been contained herein. 
21.    Effective Date.    This amended and restated Plan shall be effective August 1, 2017,
subject to the approval of the shareholders of the Company.

  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION



 
Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures to adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, such as cost reduction initiatives,
restructuring programs, integration activities and other business acquisition-related costs, separation activities, and favorable adjustments to tax expense as a result of the resolution of tax
positions from a previous year. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations excluding these costs, similar
to how Abbott's management internally assesses performance. 
Abbott's
management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial
measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance. Abbott, however, cautions
investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
