PROXY STATEMENT FOR 1996 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

This proxy statement is furnished to stockholders by the Board of Directors for
solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on
Tuesday, May 14, 1996, at 10 a.m., and at all adjournments thereof, for the
purposes set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Any
proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it
at any time before it is exercised in any of the following ways: (1) by a
written instruction to the Office of the Secretary reasonably indicating the
stockholder's desire to revoke an existing proxy; (2) by signing and returning
to the Company a proxy with a more recent date than that of the proxy first
given; or (3) by signing and returning a floor ballot at the meeting of
stockholders.

The Company will bear the cost of preparing, printing and mailing material in
connection with this solicitation of proxies. In addition to the use of the
mails, solicitations may be made by regular employees of the Company personally
and by telephone. The Company intends to reimburse brokerage firms, banks and
others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including clerical expenses,
in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners of stock or otherwise in
connection with this solicitation of proxies. The Company has retained Georgeson
& Co., Inc., to assist in the solicitation at a cost of approximately $15,000,
plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The Company anticipates that the proxy statement and the form of proxy enclosed
will first be sent to its stockholders on or about March 25, 1996.

The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a policy that all stockholder
meeting proxies, ballots and tabulations that identify stockholders are to be
maintained in confidence, and no such document shall be available for
examination, nor shall the identity and vote of any stockholder be disclosed,
except as may be necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to allow
the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes shall be
independent and shall not be employees of the Company.

RECORD DATE AND VOTING SECURITIES
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 1996, are
entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of February 29, 1996, the Company had
outstanding and entitled to vote 418,602,033 shares of common stock without par
value.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
Shares held for the account of persons participating in the Company's dividend
reinvestment plan will be voted automatically in accordance with the vote
indicated by the stockholder of record on the proxy and, if no choice is
indicated, both record shares and shares held in the Company's dividend
reinvestment plan will be voted FOR Items 1 and 2 and AGAINST Item 3. If the
stockholder does not vote the shares held of record, the individual's shares
held in the dividend reinvestment account will not be voted.

ITEM 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

NUMBER OF NOMINEES AND CLASSIFICATION
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended, and the
Bylaws of the Company, as amended, provide that the Board of Directors shall
consist of such number of directors as shall be fixed from time to time by
resolution of the Board of Directors. At its meeting of February 12, 1996, the
Board of Directors fixed the number of directors constituting the entire Board
at 13, effective as of the date of the 1996 Annual Meeting.

The Restated Certificate of Incorporation divides the Board into three classes.
Five directors have terms of office that expire at the 1996 Annual Meeting, and
four of these directors are standing for reelection for a three-year term as
members of the 1999 Class. These four are Ronald A. Mitsch, Rozanne L. Ridgway,
Frank Shrontz, and Louis W. Sullivan. Mr. Hammerly elected to take early
retirement and is not standing for reelection at the 1996 Annual Meeting. Mr.
Eaton has announced his plans to take early retirement and has resigned his
position as a director in the 1997 Class, effective at the date of the Annual
Meeting. The remaining three directors in the 1997 Class are continuing to serve
until the 1997 Annual Meeting; and the four directors in the 1998 Class are
continuing to serve until the 1998 Annual Meeting.

All nominees for election to the Board of Directors to the 1999 Class at the
1996 Annual Meeting will be elected for a term of three years and shall serve
until their terms expire at the 1999 Annual Meeting or until their successors
are duly elected and have been qualified.

In order to more evenly balance the three respective classes of Directors,
two new nominees are standing for election for the remaining term of the 1997
Class for the first time. The new nominees are Ronald O. Baukol and W. George
Meredith. They will be elected for a term of one year and shall serve until
their terms expire at the 1997 Annual Meeting or until their successors are duly
elected and have been qualified.

The persons named as proxies intend to vote the proxies for the election of the
six nominees to the Board of Directors or, if any of the nominees should be
unavailable to serve as a director, an event which is not anticipated, the
persons named as proxies reserve full discretion to vote for any other persons
who may be nominated.

INFORMATION AS TO NOMINEES AND INCUMBENT DIRECTORS
The nominees and incumbent directors, their age, principal occupation or
position with the Company (shown in italics), experience, the year first elected
as a director, and common stock beneficially owned on February 29, 1996, are
shown on the following pages.

"Shares held" include: stock held in joint tenancy, stock owned as tenants in
common, stock owned or held by spouse or other members of the nominee's
household, and stock in which the nominee either has or shares voting and/or
investment power, even though the nominee disclaims any beneficial interest in
such stock. Options exercisable within 60 days after February 29, 1996, are
shown separately.

"Shares held as deferred stock" by nonemployee directors represent the number of
shares of the Company's common stock, as of December 31, 1995, which the
directors will receive upon termination of membership on the Board of Directors
for any reason. These shares result from the voluntary election by the
nonemployee directors to defer the payment of directors fees otherwise payable
in cash into such deferred stock. No shares of common stock have as yet been
issued, and the directors have neither voting nor investment powers in these
shares of deferred stock.

As of February 29, 1996, executive officers and directors as a group
"beneficially owned" 468,948 shares and held options exercisable within 60 days
after that date for 952,926 shares. All officers and directors as a group owned
beneficially less than one half of one percent (0.5%) of the outstanding common
stock of the Company.

None of the nominees or incumbent directors is related to any other nominee or
to any executive officer of the Company or its subsidiaries by blood, marriage
or adoption. Except for current employees of the Company and Mr. Jacobson, no
nominee or incumbent director has been an employee of the Company within the
past five years.

During 1995, the Company retained the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
with regard to various legal matters. Mrs. Peters is a partner in this firm.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

This report was prepared at the direction of the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which is composed entirely of nonemployee
directors of the Company. The Committee establishes and periodically reviews
compensation levels and policies for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and
other executive officers, and authorizes short-term and long-term compensation
in the form of cash or stock. The current members of the Committee are Edward A.
Brennan, who serves as Chairman, Allen F. Jacobson, Rozanne L. Ridgway, and
Frank Shrontz.

COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES

The executive compensation program is designed to align total compensation with
the Company's strategic objectives and ensure that payouts are driven by Company
performance and employee contribution to the Company. Executive compensation is
linked to Company performance compared to specific financial and non-financial
objectives, ranging from achieving earnings and sales growth targets to
upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate Values (which include customer
satisfaction through superior quality and value, attractive investor return,
ethical business conduct, respecting the environment, and fostering employee
pride in the Company).

In determining the amount and type of executive compensation, the Committee
seeks to achieve the following objectives:

     *    To attract, motivate, and retain talented, competent, and resourceful
          executive officers by providing competitive compensation.

     *    To encourage executives to hold significant amounts of Company stock.

     *    To require that a substantial portion of executive compensation is "at
          risk" by being tied to quantifiable short-term and long-term measures
          of the Company's performance.

It is also the Company's policy to take reasonable steps to obtain the fullest
possible corporate tax deduction for compensation paid to its executive officers
by qualifying for the exemptions from limitation on such deductibility under
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 ("Code"). The Profit Sharing
Plan and amendments to the Performance Unit Plan were approved by shareholders
in 1994 and these two plans are now designed to permit qualification for
deduction under the Code. The Counsel for the Committee has reviewed the
Company's 1992 Management Stock Option Program and has determined that this plan
also meets Code requirements for deductibility under Section 162(m).

PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING COMPENSATION
The Committee begins the process of establishing the amount of compensation for
the CEO and other executive officers by reviewing compensation surveys of
selected peer companies. The surveys are primarily conducted by independent
consultants specializing in executive compensation. The peer companies included
in the compensation surveys are selected by the independent consultants. These
peer companies consist of large industrial companies that are most likely to be
competitors for executive talent. The objective of the Committee is to use the
survey data to establish a competitive level of total compensation.

The Committee does not target any specific quartile of the survey data for total
compensation or any component of total compensation (e.g., Base Salary, Profit
Sharing, Performance Unit Plan or Stock Options). The Committee's objective of
achieving the total compensation at a competitive level has resulted in
short-term compensation (base salary and profit sharing) being slightly below
the median and long-term compensation (performance unit plan and stock options)
being at or slightly above the median. The Committee believes that the Company's
most direct competitors for executive talent are not necessarily all of the
companies that would be included in a peer group established to compare
shareholder returns. Thus, the peer group for purposes of the compensation
surveys is not the same as the peer group index in the Comparison of Five and
Ten Year Cumulative Total Return graphs included on page 18 of this Proxy
Statement.

After the Committee has established the amount of total compensation for the CEO
and other executive officers, the Committee next determines what percent of the
total compensation for a particular individual should be allocated to short-term
compensation in the form of base salary and profit sharing, and long-term
compensation in the form of the performance unit plan and stock options. This
determination is subjective, but is based on information from the compensation
surveys and the objectives for executive compensation referred to above. It is
the Committee's long-standing policy that variable, at-risk compensation, both
short-and long-term, should make up a significant portion of executive
compensation. Depending upon the level of the executive, the Committee targets
between 45 percent and 75 percent of executive compensation to be variable and
at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures of the Company's performance.

ELEMENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Each of the components of short-and long-term executive compensation is
described in greater detail below.

BASE SALARY
The Committee establishes base salaries annually in relation to base salaries
paid by the selected peer companies from the compensation surveys. Base salaries
may be adjusted from time to time according to guidelines established for all
employees to reflect increased salary levels within the peer group, increased
responsibilities or individual performance. This is the only component of
executive compensation that is not variable. The Committee does not use
financial performance factors, such as earnings per share, in establishing Base
Salary.

PROFIT SHARING
Profit sharing is variable compensation based on the quarterly consolidated net
income of the Company and is used to focus management attention on profits and
the effective use of assets. The number of profit sharing units granted to the
CEO and executive officers is determined by the Committee as part of the overall
compensation. The number of profit sharing units allocated to each of the named
executive officers is established by the Committee, in the exercise of its
collective judgment, to achieve the appropriate ratio between short-term,
performance-based compensation and other forms of compensation, and to reflect
the level of responsibility of the respective executive officer.

The amount payable with respect to each profit sharing unit is determined by
dividing the Company's consolidated quarterly net income, less a quarterly
reserve of two and one-half percent of stockholders' equity (or approximately
ten percent on an annual basis), by the number of outstanding shares of the
Company's common stock. Because of the required minimum return on stockholder
equity, the amount of compensation paid under the profit sharing plan tends to
rise and fall relatively more sharply than changes in net income. No amount will
be payable under the profit sharing plan if the Company's quarterly net income
is equal to or less than the quarterly reserve of two and one-half percent
return on stockholders' equity. Profit sharing payments are subject to
limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to Base
Salary.

For the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, a portion
of profit sharing is paid in cash and a portion is paid in stock which is held
by the Company for ten years or until age 65, whichever occurs first. The ratio
between that portion of profit sharing paid in cash and the portion paid in
stock to the named executive officers for 1995 is subjective and varies from
year to year and among executive officers. However, the more senior executive
officers generally have been paid a larger portion of profit sharing in stock
than less senior executive officers. (More details about the Company's Profit
Sharing Plan are provided on page 11 of this Proxy Statement.)

PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN
The Performance Unit Plan is variable compensation based on the Company's
long-term performance. The number of performance units allocated to each of the
named executive officers is established by the Committee, in its judgment, to
achieve the appropriate ratio between long-term, performance-based compensation
and other forms of compensation. The number of performance units granted to the
CEO and executive officers is determined by the Committee as part of the overall
compensation. The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted
is determined by and is contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria
described below over the performance period 1995-1997 (each year weighted
equally). The performance criteria have been selected to focus management
attention on the quality of future earnings and assets and on global real sales
growth. (More details about the Company's Performance Unit Plan are provided on
page 15 of this Proxy Statement.)

Performance Criteria:
(1) "Relative ROCE" is the percentage determined by dividing the Company's
average return on capital employed by the average return on capital employed of
the companies included, at the end of each year of the performance period, in
the Standard and Poor's Industrial Index ("S&P 400 ROCE"); and

(2) "Sales Growth" is the percentage amount by which the Company's real sales
growth (sales growth adjusted for inflation and currency effects) exceeds the
weighted average of real growth reflected by the Industrial Production Index for
seven major industrial countries (the "Big 7 IPI").

Performance Unit Plan Payments:
The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted in 1995 is $100
if both the Relative ROCE and Sales Growth targets are achieved and is payable
on January 1, 2001, in the form (at the discretion of the Committee) of cash,
stock or a combination of cash and stock. The maximum amount payable with
respect to each performance unit is $200. No amount will be payable under the
Performance Unit Plan if either the Company's cumulative ROCE is less than 150
percent of the S&P 400 ROCE or if Sales Growth (as defined above) is less than
zero percent.

STOCK OPTIONS
The Company's Stock Option plan is also variable compensation. It is based on
the market appreciation of the Company's common stock and is designed to
increase ownership of the Company's stock. The Company makes stock option grants
annually at 100 percent of the market price on the date of grant. The options
may be exercised after one year and have a ten year life. The number of shares
under options to be granted to the CEO and executive officers is determined by
the Committee as part of the overall compensation. The awards are designed to
keep total compensation competitive with awards made by companies in the survey
group, and as such require subjective judgment as to the value of the award. The
number of option shares currently held by each executive is not considered in
determining awards. Stock options encourage executives to become owners of the
Company, which further aligns their interests with the shareholders. Options
have no value unless the price of the Company's stock increases.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
The compensation of Livio D. DeSimone, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is determined by the same process and consists of the same short-and
long-term components as for the other executive officers listed in the Summary
Compensation Table, namely base salary, profit sharing, performance unit plan
and stock options. A higher portion of Mr. DeSimone's total compensation is
variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures of the Company's
performance. These measures are quarterly net income, Relative ROCE and Sales
Growth, as those terms are defined above, and appreciation in the value of 3M
stock.

In addition, the compensation paid to Mr. DeSimone is also based on performance
against non-financial measures, such as upholding the Company's Statement of
Corporate Values (which include customer satisfaction through superior quality
and value, attractive investor return, ethical business conduct, respecting the
environment and fostering employee pride in their company), management
succession planning, and the general overall perception of the Company by
financial and business leaders. In order to keep Mr. DeSimone's total
compensation competitive, the Committee increased his base salary in 1995, which
is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 11 of this Proxy
Statement. Because of increased performance in 1995, Mr. DeSimone's profit
sharing cash and profit sharing stock was greater in 1995 than in 1994. The
Committee awarded Mr. DeSimone the same number of performance units (7,700) as
it awarded him in 1994.

(1) The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table do not include amounts
expensed for financial reporting purposes under the Company's pension plan. This
plan is a defined benefit plan. The amounts shown in the Table do, however,
include those amounts voluntarily deferred by the named individuals under the
Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows
management personnel to defer portions of current base salary, profit sharing
and performance unit compensation earned during the year.

(2) The amounts shown under the headings "Profit Sharing Cash (Bonus)" and
"Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock Awards)" are payments received under the
Profit Sharing Plan. The terms "(Bonus)" and "(Restricted Stock Awards)" are
included to satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). These payments are based upon the Company's performance and are
variable in accordance with a predetermined formula. The Compensation Committee
does not view these payments as bonus payments or restricted stock awards as
these terms are most often used. The Committee views bonus plans as plans which
provide for annual (as opposed to quarterly) payments from a pool, rather than
based on a strict formula related to earnings per share. Restricted stock awards
are generally outright grants of stock as opposed to payment in the form of
stock held in the custody of the company (restricted period) in lieu of cash
under a formula-based profit sharing plan.

Generally, profit sharing is paid in cash; however, senior executive management,
as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive a portion of their profit
sharing in shares of the Company's common stock (see footnote 3 on page 12).

The Company's Profit Sharing Plan provides for quarterly payments based upon net
income after deducting an allowance for a predetermined 10 percent annual rate
of return on stockholder equity and is determined by multiplying the number of
profit sharing units awarded to an individual by this quarterly net income,
after deduction, divided by the number of the outstanding shares of the
Company's Common Stock.

Because of the required minimum return on stockholder equity, profit sharing
tends to rise and fall relatively more sharply than changes in net income.

The number of profit sharing units awarded to the individuals named is
determined by the Compensation Committee and is intended to reflect the level of
responsibility of the respective individual. Profit sharing payments are subject
to limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to base
salary. Approximately 4,300 management employees currently participate in profit
sharing, including the five individuals in the summary compensation table.

(3) The amount shown under the heading "Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock
Awards)" represents the portion of profit sharing issued as common stock to the
named individuals, valued at 100 percent of the fair market value at the end of
the quarterly profit sharing performance period. The number of shares is
determined by the Company's quarterly net income performance. However, payment
is deferred and conditional upon continued employment by the Company. Therefore,
pursuant to SEC rules, it is included under the headings of "Long Term
Compensation."

The shares are held in the custody of the Company for a period of ten years or
until age 65, whichever occurs first. Any termination of employment, prior to
that time, without the consent of the Compensation Committee or the Board of
Directors, other than upon death or permanent disability, will result in
forfeiture of the Profit Sharing Stock. The recipient is entitled to receive
dividends and vote these shares in the same manner as any other holder of the
Company's common stock during the period of custody by the Company.

From the time of issuance throughout the Restricted Period, Profit Sharing Stock
rises or falls in value in direct relationship to the Company's common stock
market performance. Consequently, Profit Sharing Stock reflects both short-term
and long-term performance elements.

The named individuals have accumulated, in one case over eight years, the
following shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's Profit
Sharing Plan as of December 31, 1995, valued for these purposes at the fair
market value of such stock on December 31, 1995, and also on the respective
dates when the shares were issued into the custody of the Company:

R.O. Baukol            661         43,874          39,132

(4) "Other Annual Compensation" includes the following, to the extent that the
aggregate thereof exceeds $50,000: personal benefits received by the named
individuals, amounts reimbursed the individuals during the year for payment of
taxes, and that portion of interest above market rates (as determined by the
Securities and Exchange Commission) earned on that compensation voluntarily
deferred by the individuals. The personal benefits included in these numbers
represent the amount of personal financial planning services, an amount paid on
behalf of the individual for the term portion of insurance under the Company's
Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan, and personal air travel on corporate
aircraft imputed to the individual as income for tax purposes. In the case of
Mr. DeSimone, nearly all of the "Other Annual Compensation" received in 1994 and
1995 was a result of income imputed to him for travel.

(5) The number of stock options shown in this column includes both annual grants
of incentive and nonqualified stock options and Progressive Stock Options, which
are described more fully in footnote 1 on page 13.

(6) "LTIP Payouts" reflects the value of the total grant for each individual
under the Company's Performance Unit Plan after the three year performance
period (e.g., for 1995, the performance period is 1993-1995), but no amount will
be paid to these individuals under the grant for an additional three years
pursuant to the terms of the grant. The numbers shown represent estimates based
upon information available as of February 29, 1996. During this additional three
year period, interest will be paid at a rate determined by the Company's ROCE
performance. More specific information about the Performance Unit Plan is set
forth on page 9.

(7) "All Other Compensation" includes: (a) that amount of Performance Unit Plan
earnings allocated during the year to the base amounts determined after the
three year performance periods of each respective grant, to the extent that such
earnings are in excess of market interest rates (as determined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission); and (b) that amount deemed to be compensation to the
individuals under the Company's Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan in accordance
with rules developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Senior
Executive Split Dollar Plan provides insurance to all of the Company's executive
officers under split dollar life insurance, which is partly term insurance and
partly whole life insurance with a cash value. Under this Plan, the Company is
reimbursed for the premium costs of the non-term portion of coverage and a
possible return when the arrangement terminates either by insurance proceeds
incident to the death of the individual or by cash value after 15 years of
participation in the Plan. During 1995, amounts deemed compensation under the
Plan to the named executive officers in the Summary Compensation Table were
$9,633 for Mr. DeSimone; $16,160 for Dr. Mitsch; $17,034 for Mr. Eaton; $12,056
for Mr. Agostini; and $19,432 for Mr. Baukol. These amounts were determined by
treating the non-term portion of the coverage as an interest-free loan.

(1) The Company does not grant any stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). The
options shown for each individual include both annual grants of Incentive Stock
Options and nonqualified stock options and grants of Progressive Stock Options
("PSO"). Nonqualified options are subject to a reload feature when exercised
with the payment of the option price in the form of previously owned shares of
the Company's common stock. Such an exercise results in further grants of PSOs.
The first grant shown for each individual is the annual grant. The remaining
lines are PSOs. The PSO grants for each individual were made on a single date,
but are, pursuant to SEC rules, shown in multiple lines because of different
expiration dates.

PSO grants were made to participants who exercised nonqualified stock options
and who paid the purchase price using shares of previously owned Company common
stock. The PSO grant is for the number of shares equal to the shares utilized in
payment of the purchase price and tax withholding, if any. The option price for
the PSO is equal to 100 percent of the market value of the Company's common
stock on the date of the exercise of the primary option or, alternatively, on
the date of the PSO grant to the five named individuals in the Table, all of
whom are subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The option period is equal to the remaining period of the options
exercised.

Company common stock used for payment must have been owned by the participant
for at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified options per
participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO grants by the Committee.

The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of nonqualified stock options,
without foregoing the opportunity for further appreciation, and promotes
retention of the Company stock acquired.

In any event, a participant receiving an annual grant of nonqualified stock
options can never acquire more shares of Company common stock through successive
exercises of the initial and subsequent PSO grants than the number of shares
covered by the initial annual grant from the Committee.

(2) All options granted during the period were granted at the market value on
the date of grant if initial grants, or at the fair market values discussed in
footnote 1 above in the case of Progressive Stock Options, as calculated from
the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index. The option price shown for the "All Optionees" line is $59.60
because the vast majority of options granted during 1995 carried that price.

(3) The expiration date for the "All Optionees" line is shown as May 9, 2005,
since that is the applicable date for the vast majority of options granted
during 1995.

(4) Pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company
has elected to provide a grant date present value for these option grants
determined by a modified Black-Scholes pricing model. Among key assumptions
utilized in this pricing model were: (i) that the time of exercise of Incentive
Stock Options would be four years, and of PSOs would be two years, into the term
of the option, which could be for terms as long as ten years, in recognition of
the historical exercise patterns at the Company for these types of options; (ii)
expected volatility of 21.7 percent; (iii) risk-free rate of return of 6.26
percent for two years, and 6.86 percent for four years; and (iv) dividend growth
rate of 6.34 percent. No adjustments for non-transferability or risk of
forfeiture have been made. The Company voices no opinion that the present value
will, in fact, be realized and expressly disclaims any representation to that
effect.

(1) The "Value Realized" or the unrealized "Value of Unexercised In-the-Money
Options at FY-End" represents the aggregate difference between the market value
on the date of exercise or at December 31, 1995, in the case of the unrealized
values, and the applicable exercise prices. These differences accumulate over
what may be, in many cases, several years. These stock options all have option
periods of ten years when first granted, and Progressive Stock Options have
option periods equal to the remaining option period of the initial nonqualified
options resulting in Progressive Stock Options.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) The Company's Performance Unit Plan provides long-term compensation to
approximately 110 key management personnel based upon the Company's attainment
of long-term performance and growth criteria.

It is administered by the Compensation Committee, none of the members of which
are current employees of the Company. The Committee has sole discretion in the
selection of participants, performance criteria, size of awards, performance
period, and the timing and form of payment, as well as all other conditions
regarding awards.

To date, the Committee has established the performance goals based on criteria
of return on capital employed and sales growth. More detail about current
performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report on page 9.
Performance units awarded to date have been assigned a face value of $100 each.
However, the actual amount of the payments is based upon the Company's
attainment of the performance goals. If the targets established by the Committee
are attained during the performance periods, the performance unit will have a
value of $100 at the end of the performance period. If the targets are not
attained, the value will be less than $100 and, if exceeded, will be more than
$100. The ultimate value of the performance unit can vary from no value to $200,
depending upon actual performance.

Payment is contingent upon continued employment to the payment date or earlier
retirement under the Company's pension plan. Participants receiving awards
during 1995, including the five executive officers in the Summary Compensation
Table, will receive payment in 2001, provided that such individuals continue
employment with the Company until such payment date (except in the event of
death, retirement, or disability). Payment under the Plan may be made in cash,
shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination of cash and stock, at
the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In the past, payment has been made
only in cash.

(2) The value of awards granted for 1995 will be determined by the Company's
attainment of return on capital employed and sales growth criteria during a
three-year performance period of 1995, 1996 and 1997. More detail about current
performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report on page 9.
However, there will be an additional three-year involuntary holding period
thereafter during which the base amounts determined during the performance
period will earn interest and remain subject to forfeiture if the participant
discontinues employment for any reason other than death, disability or
retirement.

(3) The estimated future payouts do not include any interest factor that would
be earned annually during the three-year involuntary holding period following
the performance period. Interest during the involuntary holding period would
accrue annually at a rate equal to 50 percent of the return on capital employed
of the Company during the three years and would be payable, together with the
base award, in 2001.

(1) Earnings include base salary, profit sharing cash, and the value of Profit
Sharing Stock (at the time of award) actually earned by the participant and do
not include any other forms of remuneration. The benefits are computed on the
basis of straight-life annuity amounts, and are not subject to any deduction for
social security or other offset amounts.

(2) To provide for the retirement security of its employees, the Company has
defined benefit pension plans for U.S. employees. These plans are fully paid by
the Company, and employees become vested after five years of service. Under the
plans, a participant may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60, and if the
participant's age and service total at least 90, he or she would receive a
Social Security bridge to age 62.

The five individuals listed in the Summary Compensation Table are presently
entitled to the respective years of service credit set opposite their names:

DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

Directors who are not employed by the Company receive an annual fee of $38,000
and an additional fee of $5,500 per year for serving as Committee chairman.
Messrs. Brennan and Murray received these additional fees in 1995. Nonemployee
directors are paid $1,800 for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors
and $1,200 for attendance at meetings of Committees of the Board. No directors'
fees are paid to directors who were also employees of the Company. During 1995,
there were six meetings of the Board of Directors, and each nonemployee
director, other than Mr. Hammerly, attended seven meetings of Committees of the
Board.

Pursuant to the terms of the Company's 1992 Directors Stock Ownership Program,
nonemployee directors received $13,000 of the total annual retainer of $38,000
in common stock of the Company only, if, at the time of payment, the nonemployee
director owned fewer than 13,000 shares of the Company's common stock. This
ceiling of 13,000 shares has been removed, effective at the date of the 1996
Annual Meeting, such that all nonemployee directors will receive this portion of
the retainer in shares of the Company's common stock, from that date going
forward. In addition, nonemployee directors may elect to defer payment of all or
a portion of the foregoing fees payable in cash through a deferred cash or
common stock equivalents account. The nonemployee directors also may elect to
receive common stock of the Company, on a current basis, at current fair market
value, in lieu of cash retainer and meeting fees. All of the current nonemployee
directors not previously employed by the Company voluntarily elect to receive
shares of the Company's common stock, either on a current or deferred basis, in
lieu of cash fees. Information regarding accumulated deferred stock is set forth
in the director biographical materials on pages 3 through 6.

In addition to the compensation described above, nonemployee directors, who
serve more than one year are granted deferred income that is payable upon their
retirement from the Board of Directors. This deferred income is paid annually,
on an ongoing basis, in an amount equal to the annual retainer in effect at the
date of their retirement from the Board, for a period of time equal to their
length of service on the Board as a nonemployee director. By action of the Board
of Directors on November 13, 1995, this supplemental deferred income has been
terminated, effective on the date of the 1996 Annual Meeting, and will be
replaced with a similar deferred compensation plan payable only in shares of the
Company's common stock.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
The members of the Committee are Messrs. Brennan (Chairman), Jacobson,
Shrontz and Ambassador Ridgway.

Mr. Jacobson retired on November 1, 1991, as Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company. The Securities and Exchange Commission
requires that Mr. Jacobson's participation on the Committee be characterized as
"insider participation" based upon his former employment with 3M. The Board of
Directors believes that Mr. Jacobson's participation in the deliberations of the
Committee provides continuity and specific knowledge about individual
performances and, further, that no conflicts of interest exist. Mr. Jacobson did
not participate in any grant or award decisions of the Committee during the
one-year period following his retirement or with regard to any matter that might
affect him personally.

Mr. Jacobson will not continue his membership on the Compensation Committee
beyond the 1996 Annual Meeting.

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following table compares the Company's annualized shareholder return,
overall stock market performance with reinvested dividends, during the ten years
preceding December 31, 1995, against the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The following graphs compare the Company's
cumulative total shareholder return, overall stock market performance with
reinvested dividends, during the ten fiscal years and five fiscal years
preceding December 31, 1995, against the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both of which are well-known and published
industry indices. The Company is included in both the S&P 500 Stock Index and
the Dow Jones Industrial group of 30 companies. The Company, as a highly
diversified manufacturer and seller of a broad line of products, is not easily
categorized with other, more specific industry indices.

TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT

During 1995, nine executive officers and directors had loans outstanding with
the Eastern Heights Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. These loans were made in
the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including
interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other persons of comparable circumstances and did not involve
more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.

AUDIT, COMPENSATION, AND BOARD ORGANIZATION
 COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The Audit, Compensation, and Board Organization Committees are standing
Committees of the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
Members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Murray (Chairman), Mr. Junkins, Mrs.
Peters, Mr. Smith, and Dr. Sullivan. The Committee met four times during
1995. Its primary functions are to recommend the appointment of independent
accountants; review the scope of the annual audit, including fees and
staffing; review the independence of the auditors; review and approve
nonaudit services provided by the auditors; review findings and
recommendations of the auditors and management's response; review the
internal audit and control function; and review compliance with the Company's
ethical business practices policy.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Brennan (Chairman), Jacobson,
Shrontz and Ambassador Ridgway. The Committee met four times during 1995. Its
primary functions are to review management compensation programs, approve
compensation changes for senior executive officers, review compensation changes
for senior management, and administer management stock option plans (acting
without any person who may be a participant under any such plans).

BOARD ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE
Members of the Board Organization Committee are Messrs. DeSimone (Chairman),
Jacobson, Junkins, Murray, Smith, and Ambassador Ridgway. The Committee met
three times during 1995. The Committee acts to select and recommend candidates
to the Board of Directors to be submitted for election at the Annual Meeting.
The Board of Directors has adopted criteria with respect to its membership and
the Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders or others in
light of these criteria. A stockholder may submit the name of a proposed nominee
by writing to the Office of the Secretary, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company, 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota 55144. The Committee also reviews and
makes recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning the composition and
size of the Board and its committees, frequency of meetings, directors' fees,
and similar subjects; reviews and makes recommendations concerning retirement
and tenure policy for Board membership; recommends proxies for meetings at which
directors are elected; and audits programs for senior management succession.

SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

The rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require disclosure of late
Section 16 filings by 3M directors and executive officers. To the best of the
Company's knowledge and belief, there were no late filings during 1995.

ITEM 2. INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Audit Committee recommended and the Board of Directors appointed the firm of
Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., independent accountants, to audit the books and
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year 1996. In accordance
with the Bylaws of the Company, this appointment is being presented to the
stockholders for ratification. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection
of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P., the selection will be reconsidered by the Board of
Directors.

Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. has audited the Company's books since 1975. The firm
has offices and affiliates in most localities throughout the world where the
Company has operations. Audit services provided by the firm in 1995 included:
audit of consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries;
limited reviews of interim reports; reviews of filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission; consultations on matters related to accounting and
financial reporting; audits of statutory financial statements for certain
foreign subsidiaries; and audits of the financial statements of the Company's
benefit plans.

Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. also provided a number of nonaudit services during
1995, all of which were approved or reviewed by the Audit Committee.

A representative of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. is expected to be present at the
stockholders meeting and available to respond to appropriate questions and will
be given an opportunity to make a statement, if the representative chooses to do
so.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE
APPOINTMENT OF COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P., INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS, TO AUDIT THE
BOOKS AND ACCOUNTS FOR 1996. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE
VOTED FOR RATIFICATION UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE IS SPECIFIED.

ITEM 3. STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REINCORPORATION IN MINNESOTA

The following stockholder proposal was submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by Aaron Belk, Trustee of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters Affiliates Pension Fund, 25 Louisiana Avenue N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20001, which Fund is the beneficial owner of 12,600 shares of
the Company's common stock. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of all
shares of common stock of the Company entitled to vote and cast with respect
thereto shall be required for the adoption of this proposal regarding
reincorporation of the Company in the State of Minnesota.

PROPOSAL
RESOLVED: That shareholders urge the Board of Directors of Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing Company take the steps necessary to reincorporate our
Company from Delaware to Minnesota.

SUPPORTING STATEMENT
We believe that our company, founded in Minnesota, headquartered in Minnesota,
and named for Minnesota, should not be governed by the corporate laws of
Delaware.

We believe that the accident of history that permits corporations to charter in
any state has created an unhealthy competition among the states to write
management-friendly law. Delaware, in leading this competition, reaps
substantial incorporation fees -- enough to reduce personal taxes on its
citizens.

Last year when this same resolution faced shareholder vote, 3M's management
contended that Minnesota law isn't necessarily any better. In part, we agree.
Any state that dares to strengthen its incorporation laws to serve shareholders,
risks losing the few companies still chartered in that state to Delaware.

Delaware's control of 3M and many other corporations, as well as the so-called
"race to the bottom," causes much of what's wrong with corporate accountability
- -- classified boards, supermajority voting requirements, limited director
liability, restrictions on cumulative voting, poor regulation of vote
tabulation, non-confidential voting, and more.

There are at least two solutions to this problem. One is to federalize
corporations. The other is for shareholders to use prerogatives of the proxy
vote. After all, it's not management's decision to charter in Delaware, or
Minnesota; it's the shareholders decision.

We urge you to vote FOR this resolution.

COMPANY'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSAL
The Company's operations began in 1902 as a Minnesota corporation. In 1929, the
Company was reincorporated in Delaware for reasons unrelated to the issues
raised in this proposal. A separate court system devoted to corporate and
business matters remains unique to the State of Delaware. That court system and
a large body of law result in a high degree of predictability in legal matters
affecting business corporations.

Of the top 100 industrial corporations in the United States, more than 60
percent are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Another 15 percent are
incorporated in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction of their principal
business location. Fewer than 25 percent are actually incorporated in the
jurisdiction of their principal business location, as suggested should be the
case for the Company in this proposal.

The Board of Directors does not believe that any particular effect on the
governance of the Company would result solely as a result of reincorporation in
Minnesota.

The act of reincorporation through liquidation and dissolution or merger would
necessitate extensive efforts and expenses that would run in the millions of
dollars, for no particular advantage. The transfer of properties and assets, the
assignment of all contracts, the cancellation and reissuance of all outstanding
shares of the Company, and similar tasks incidental to such reincorporation,
would clearly distract attention from primary business objectives of the
Company. As an example, all outstanding common stock of the Company in the
possession of or controlled by its stockholders would necessarily be surrendered
in return for new certificates of a new corporation.

This proposal is not in the best interest of the Company or your interests as
stockholders.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL

TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN
AND THE 3M EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trusts established in
connection with the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") and the 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan (the "VIP"). As Trustee, it is the record owner of the
shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company ("3M") held
in the ESOP and the Company Contribution Accounts of the VIP for the benefit of
participants. Since the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership
Plan ("PAYSOP") applicable to union-free employees was merged into the ESOP
during 1990, the shares of 3M common stock held in the PAYSOP Trust have now
been transferred to the ESOP Trust.

The ESOP and the VIP each permit participants, as Named Fiduciaries, to instruct
the respective Trustees how to vote the number of shares of 3M common stock
allocated to the participants' respective accounts. Additionally, as a Named
Fiduciary of the ESOP, you are entiltled to direct the Trustee how to vote a
proportionate number of shares which have not been allocated to participants or
for which no instruction card has been received. The number of shares of 3M
common stock held in your individual accounts in the ESOP and the VIP are
indicated at the top of the enclosed voting instruction card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
14, 1996, and Proxy Statement, (2) a card for giving voting instructions, and
(3) a return envelope. If you complete the card and return it in the enclosed
return envelope to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for
the Trustee, by May 7, 1996, the Trustee will vote, in accordance with your
instructions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your respective
accounts.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the ESOP and VIP accounts. The ability to instruct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

The enclosed instruction card must be properly completed if voting instructions
are to be honored. If the card is not received by May 7, 1996, or if the voting
instructions are invalid, the shares held in your ESOP Trust Account will be
voted by State Street Bank and Trust Company in the same proportion that the
other participants in the ESOP direct the Trustee to vote the shares held in
their ESOP accounts, and the shares held in your VIP account shall be voted by
State Street Bank and Trust Company as directed by the Public Issues Committee
of the 3M Board of Directors.

Please complete, date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed voting instruction
card.



TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M SAVINGS PLAN

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trust established in
connection with the 3M Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"). As Trustee, it is the
record owner of the shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company ("3M") held in the Savings Plan for the benefit of participants. Since
the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP")
applicable to employees eligible to participate in the Savings Plan was merged
into the Savings Plan during 1993, the shares of 3M common stock held in the
PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the Savings Plan. 

The Savings Plan permits participants to instruct the Trustee how to vote the
number of shares of 3M common stock allocated to the participants' respective
accounts. The number of shares of 3M common stock held in your individual
account in the Savings Plan are indicated at the top of the enclosed voting
instruction card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
14, 1996, and Proxy Statement, (2) a card for giving voting instructions, and
(3) a return envelope. If you complete the card and return it in the enclosed
return envelope to Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for
the Trustee, by May 7, 1996, the Trustee will vote, in accordance with your
instructions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your account.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the Savings Plan accounts. The ability to instruct the Trustee how to vote
confers no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

The enclosed instruction card must be properly completed if voting instructions
are to be honored. If the card is not received by May 7, 1996, or if the voting
instructions are invalid, the shares held in your Savings Plan account shall be
voted by State Street Bank and Trust Company, as directed by the Public Issues
Committee of the 3M Board of Directors.

Please complete, date, sign, and promptly return the enclosed voting instruction
card.



IMPORTANT INFORMATION
IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING

Again this year, the St. Paul Civic Center will be undergoing major renovation
when you attend our 1996 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Parking will continue to be available in the Civic Center parking ramp, south of
the arena. You may enter the ramp from either Kellogg Boulevard or on the lower
level at the intersection of Ryan Avenue and Eagle Street. See map on reverse
side of this card for details.

As part of the renovation, the pedestrian tunnel between the parking ramp and
the Civic Center no longer exits. To enter the Civic Center from the parking
ramp, take the parking ramp elevator to street level and cross Kellogg
Boulevard. Officers will be on hand to help you cross the street safely. Or, you
may take the parking ramp elevator to the lower level, where shuttle buses will
be available to take you to the Civic Center entrance.

After the meeting, shuttle bus service will be available to return you to the
parking ramp. Pick up locations will be posted inside the Civic Center.

Thank you for your patience with this major renovation project. We look forward
to seeing you at this year's meeting.
