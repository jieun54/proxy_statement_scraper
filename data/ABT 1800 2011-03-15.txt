Abbott Laboratories Proxy Statement  
Solicitation of Proxies  

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 29, 2011, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 15, 2011. 





Information about the Annual Meeting




Who Can Vote  

Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 2011 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2011, Abbott had 1,547,581,805
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
Cumulative Voting  

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees,
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy  

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most
of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting by
telephone or the Internet can be found with your proxy card. 
Revoking a Proxy  

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 

by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott,
by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or
by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 
Discretionary Voting Authority  

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares 

1

 


covered by proxies they receive to elect the 10 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated
by the board of directors, or for fewer than 10 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares
cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive
compensation, the advisory vote on the approval of the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, or the approval of the shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder has abstained on
these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Deloitte &
Touche LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, FOR an annual (1 year) shareholder advisory vote, with respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder
votes on executive compensation, and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
With
the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may
properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy  

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions  

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and
entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the
ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors, the
advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, the advisory vote on the approval of the frequency of shareholder votes on executive compensation, and the shareholder proposal are considered
"non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies
which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
Inspectors of Election  

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
Cost of Soliciting Proxies  

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan  

Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive a voting instruction card for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust
is administered by both a trustee and an investment committee. The trustee of the Trust is Mercer Trust Company. The members of the investment committee are Stephen R. Fussell, William H. Preece, Jr.,
and Valentine Yien, employees of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the investment committee and the participants. The investment committee must solicit
voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The investment committee may use its own discretion with respect to those shares for which no voting
instructions are received. 
Confidential Voting  

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 

where
disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
where
disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims,
where
a shareholder provides comments with a proxy,
where
a shareholder expressly requests disclosure,
to
allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or
in
other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors.

Information Concerning Nominees for Directors (Item 1 on Proxy Card)

The Board of Directors and its Committees  
The Board of Directors  

The board of directors held seven meetings in 2010. The average attendance of all incumbent directors at board and committee meetings in 2010 was 97 percent. Abbott encourages its board members
to attend the annual shareholders meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern, R. S. Austin, W. J.
Farrell, H. L. Fuller, E. M. Liddy, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn, D. A. L. Owen, R. S. Roberts, S. C. Scott III, W. D. Smithburg,
and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the board applied the categorical standards attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The board also considered whether a director has
any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of
the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which Abbott sold products or made contributions or from which Abbott purchased products and services
during the year. In making its determination, the board relied on both information provided by the directors and information developed internally by Abbott. 
The
board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. The board has determined that the current leadership
structure, in which the offices of chairman and chief executive officer are held by one individual and an independent director acts as lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight,
independence, and responsibility is applied to all board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of Abbott and its shareholders. The chairman of the nominations and
governance committee acts as the lead director to facilitate communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions where the
chairman of the board is not present. It is the role of the lead director to review and approve matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to
other board members. The lead director is chosen by and from the independent members of the board of directors, and serves as the liaison between the chairman and the independent directors; however,
all directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chairman on each of the above topics as well. The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with the
chairman and chief executive officer regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters. 
Abbott
directors have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Director nominees are considered on the basis
of a range of criteria including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective
and commitment to good corporate citizenship. They must have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board's oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each
director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the board to conclude that the director should serve on the board. The directors' biographies are on pages 4
to 7. 
Committees of the Board of Directors  

The board of directors has five committees established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy
committee. Each of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee is independent. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, R. S. Austin, H. L. Fuller, R. S. Roberts, and W. D. Smithburg, held three meetings in 2010. This committee may exercise all the
authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are R. S. Austin, chair, E. M. Liddy, D. A. L. Owen, S. C. Scott III, W. D. Smithburg, and G. F. Tilton, held seven meetings in 2010. The committee is governed by a
written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process,
the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance, the performance of Abbott's internal audit function and internal
auditors, and certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. Each of the members of the audit committee is financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock
Exchange. The board of directors has determined that R. S. Austin, the committee's chair, is an "audit committee financial expert." A copy of the report of the audit committee is on page 41. 
The
compensation committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, W. J. Farrell, H. L. Fuller, E. M. Liddy, and W. A. Osborn, held five meetings in 2010. The committee is governed by a written
charter. This committee assists the board of directors in carrying out the board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive officers and directors. The compensation
committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the board and gives its recommendations to the full 

8

 


board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director compensation, the
compensation committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. The processes and procedures used for the
consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of the proxy captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." This committee also reviews, approves, and
administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate the responsibility to administer and make
grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The
compensation committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The committee has engaged Aon Hewitt to provide counsel and
advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. Aon Hewitt, and its principal, report directly to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as
needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The committee
determines what variables it will instruct Aon Hewitt to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's
relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The committee negotiates and approves any fees paid
to Aon Hewitt for these services. In 2010, the committee authorized payment of approximately $336,450 to Aon Hewitt for services rendered to the committee relating to executive compensation.
Separately, Abbott management engaged Aon Hewitt to perform and paid approximately $11 million for unrelated services, including actuarial work, pension design and administration, insurance,
and general consulting. The compensation committee was informed about these services, but its formal approval was not requested. A copy of the compensation committee report is on page 19. 
The
nominations and governance committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, W. J. Farrell, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn, D. A. L. Owen, and R. S. Roberts, held two meetings in 2010. The
committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to become board members and recommends to the board the nominees for
election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders, recommends to the board the persons to be elected as executive officers of Abbott, develops and recommends to the board the corporate
governance guidelines applicable to Abbott, and serves in an advisory capacity to the board and the chairman of the board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major changes in the
organizational structure of Abbott, and the conduct of board activities. The process used by this committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the board of directors depends on the
qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the committee in identifying individuals qualified to be board members. Board members should have
backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of
the board of directors, the nominations and governance committee considers the board's diversity of ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that
diversity. Board candidates will be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary
fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the board of
directors' oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. 
The
public policy committee, whose members are R. S. Roberts, chair, R. J. Alpern, R. S. Austin, and P. N. Novakovic held one meeting in 2010. The committee is governed by a written charter. This
committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs
and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott by discharging the responsibilities set forth in its charter. 
Communicating with the Board of Directors  

Interested parties may communicate with the board of directors by writing a letter to the chairman of the board, to the chairman of the nominations and governance committee, who acts as the lead
director at the meetings of the independent directors, or to the independent directors c/o Abbott Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, D-364, AP6D, Abbott Park, Illinois
60064-6400 Attention: corporate secretary. The general counsel and corporate secretary regularly forwards to the addressee all letters other than mass mailings, advertisements, and other
materials not relevant to Abbott's business. In addition, directors regularly receive a log of all correspondence received by the company that is addressed to a member of the board and may request any
correspondence on that log. 
Corporate Governance Materials  

Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, outline of directorship qualifications, director independence standards, code of business conduct and the charters of Abbott's audit committee, compensation
committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee are all available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations Web site (www.abbottinvestor.com).

(1)Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $9,500 for each month of service as a director (effective as of the
2011 Annual Meeting, this will increase to $10,500 for each month of service) and $1,000 for each month of service as a chairman of a board committee, other than the chairman of the audit committee.
The chairman of the audit committee receives $1,500 for each month of service as a chairman of that committee and the other members of the audit committee receive $500 for each month of service as a
committee member. 

Fees
earned under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an
independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by the director. The
distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon retirement from the board of directors. The director may
elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to either a guaranteed interest account at the prime rate plus 2.25 percentage points or to a stock equivalent account that
earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year end the stock equivalent account balance (net of
taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related Abbott common stock at year end. Abbott pays the director for any tax owed with respect to the income earned
by the trust or any supplemental contributions to the trust by Abbott. 


10

 

(2)The
amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott common share on the
date of grant. 

In
addition to the fees described in footnote 1, the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program provides that each non-employee director elected to the board of directors at the
annual shareholder meeting receives vested restricted stock units having a value of $107,000 (rounded down). In 2010, this was 2,108 units. Effective as of the 2011 Annual Meeting, each non-employee
director elected at the annual shareholder meeting will receive vested restricted stock units having a value of $113,000 (rounded down). The non-employee directors receive cash payments
equal to the dividends paid on the Abbott shares covered by the units at the same rate as other shareholders. Upon termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of Abbott, a
non-employee director will receive one Abbott common share for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. 
The
following restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2010: R. J. Alpern, 4,573; R. S. Austin, 12,236;
W. M. Daley, 12,236; W. J. Farrell, 10,347; H. L. Fuller, 12,236; W. A. Osborn, 6,490;

(4)The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan during the year.
(5)The

Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, as follows: H. L. Fuller, $22,007; W. A. Reynolds, $44,765, and, W. D. Smithburg, $63,807. Charitable contributions made by Abbott's
non-employee directors are eligible for a matching contribution (up to $25,000 annually). These amounts also include charitable matching grant contributions, as follows: R. J. Alpern,

Executive Compensation  
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
INTRODUCTION  

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes Abbott's (the "Company") executive compensation program in 2010. In particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the
"Committee") and Board of Directors made its compensation decisions for our executives, including the five named Executive Officers: Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer;
Thomas C. Freyman, Executive Vice President, Finance & Chief Financial Officer; Laura J. Schumacher, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; Richard A. Gonzalez, Executive Vice
President, Pharmaceutical Products Group; and James V. Mazzo, Senior Vice President, Abbott Medical Optics. 
It
is organized in three primary sections: first, a description of the pay philosophy the Committee has established for our Executive Officers; second, a description of the process the Committee
utilizes to examine performance in the context of executive pay decisions; and lastly, a description of the performance goals and results for each named Executive Officer. 
The
Committee believes performance must always be assessed in the context of market and business conditions. 
Abbott
delivered industry-leading growth in 2010, despite a difficult global business environment and particular challenges to the healthcare industry. In the face of a weak global economy, healthcare
cost containment measures around the world, and rising regulatory hurdles that make it more difficult to get new medical products approved, Abbott delivered double-digit sales and earnings growth,
record cash flow and improved ongoing gross margin of more than 60%, while returning more than $2.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, which rose for the 38th consecutive
year. 
Over
the past five years the company has delivered shareholders a total return of 39.9%, significantly outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's Index for that
period. At the same time, it remained strategically active to help ensure the sustainability of its top-tier performance. 
In
2010, our sales and ongoing earnings growth came in many different forms: from our existing products, from new product launches, from geographic expansion, and from acquisitions. We maintained
commercial leadership positions in a wide range of attractive growth markets. And, importantly, we not only grew our sales, but we continue to take actions to improve the profitability of our
operating businesses. 
A
particular focus of the year was expanding our presence in emerging markets, which are expected to grow at three times the rate of developed markets over the next five years, making them perhaps the
most attractive opportunity in the pharmaceutical business today. In 2010, Abbott took a number of steps that quickly transformed it into a major player in emerging markets. The Solvay and Piramal
acquisitions combined to make Abbott the largest pharmaceutical company in India, an $8 billion market expected to double in the next five years. The company also completed a licensing
agreement with Zydus Cadila to market a large portfolio of branded generic products across a broad range of emerging markets. To give this business the attention and resources it needs, Abbott formed
a new division, the Established Products Division, to focus exclusively on this opportunity. 
At
the same time, the company was equally active in building and accelerating its internal new-product pipeline for future growth. Through its acquisition of Facet Biotech Corporation and
other agreements, Abbott gained four new molecular entities (NMEs) in late-stage development, and expects to have nearly 20 NMEs and indications in Phase II or Phase III
development by the end of 2011. These include unique compounds for such major health needs as chronic kidney disease, women's health, oncology, immunology, hepatitis C, neuroscience and pain
management, among other areas of high medical opportunity. 
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPONENTS OF PAY  

Abbott and its Compensation Committee have established a compensation philosophy that is designed to attract and retain executives whose talent and contributions sustain the profitable growth of the
Company. The intent of this philosophy is to directly support achievement of the Company's primary business strategies and goals, while also aligning executives' performance and rewards with
shareholders' interests. Consequently, the Committee believes the vast majority of executive compensation at Abbott is, by definition therefore, performance-based. 
There
are four primary pay components that make up our executive pay program: base pay, benefits, annual bonuses, and long-term incentives. Each serves complimentary, but different and
specific purposes. 
Base Pay 
Setting
appropriate levels of base pay ensures Abbott can attract and keep a leadership team that will continue to meet our commitments to customers and patients and sustain profitable growth for our
shareholders. Talented executives have choices of where they work, and our base pay rates need to be competitive in the context of total compensation. 
Benefits 
As
with all Abbott employees, Executive Officers are provided certain employment and post-employment benefits. Benefits are an important part of retention and capital preservation for all
levels of employees, protecting against the expense of unexpected catastrophic loss of health and/or earnings potential, as well as 

13

 


providing a means to save and accumulate for retirement or other post-employment needs. 
Annual Bonus 
Abbott's
annual bonus (short-term incentive) is intended to align executives' interests directly with the annual operating strategies, financial goals, and leadership requirements of the
business. They provide a direct link between executives' short-term incentives and the Company's annual performance results through both measurable financial and operational performance
and subjective assessments of strategic progress. Some goals, strategies, and leadership requirements may apply to all executives and as such, may be corporate priorities that are shared by all
Executive Officers in any given year (for example, earnings per share targets in 2010, as will be disclosed later). Measurable financial goals apply to some executives, reflecting their specific areas
of responsibility. 
Most
executives also carry strategic or leadership-oriented goals, which require qualitative, subjective assessment of their progress during the year. Finally, the process allows for Committee
discretion, since many goals, especially for certain positions, cannot be reduced to formulaic, numerical targets, or anticipated in advance. By definition, therefore, short-term
incentives directly tie executives' pay with both company and individual results allowing for Committee discretion to address unforeseen developments. In the aggregate, short-term
incentives should be paid roughly at target when results are substantively met, below target if not substantively met, and above target if substantively exceeded. 
Long-Term Incentives 
Long-term
incentives serve two primary purposes: first, to directly align the largest component of executive pay with shareholders' direct, long-term interests; and secondly,
to help ensure continued performance success through effective focus and retention of executive talent. Executives' interests are directly aligned with those of shareholders in two
ways  first, through direct stock ownership. Executives, as shareholders, benefit from the results they create for other shareholders. Secondly, the level of awards executives
receive vary, by design, through operation of the Plan and through the Committee's judgment, based on the Company's overall performance, as assessed by the Committee. The Committee considers, among
others, measures that either directly track shareholder returns or operating or strategic results which lead to the creation or loss of shareholder value. Awards are further differentiated based on
each executive's specific contribution to long-term strategic results and leadership contribution. To achieve this outcome, Abbott grants non-qualified stock options,
full-value performance-based shares, and full-value restricted shares, subject to vesting requirements. 
Historically,
and in 2010, long-term incentives have comprised roughly 70 percent of total compensation for Abbott Executive Officers. Accordingly, this is a compelling and direct
link of executives' long-term incentive with Company and shareholder results. 
HOW EXECUTIVE PAY DECISIONS ARE MADE  

As noted previously, the vast majority of pay decisions are performance-based. Specific goals and targets are the foundation of our pay-for-performance process and this segment
will describe how they apply to specific pay components. It is important to remember, however, that while our pay process is based on a comprehensive, multi-level review at all levels, it is not
formulaic. Some goals can be measured objectively against pre-determined financial results. Others take the form of the Committee's subjective assessment of success and progress against
strategic objectives or leadership results, which cannot be scored by numeric or formulaic application of measurable criteria. Consequently, while final pay decisions are guided by some specific,
objective measures, the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant also considers, at both the Company and individual level, a combination of objective and subjective
measures in the overall assessment of performance and the pay decisions that result from that assessment. Specifically, discussion of the decision-making criteria for each component follows. 
Base Pay 
Base
pay targets must be competitive with the target market from which talent is obtained. Our comparison groups for setting targets for base pay include two global reference groups: 

1.Primarily
to direct health care competitors. This group presently includes Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly and Company, Glaxo SmithKline plc, Johnson &
Johnson, Merck & Company, Inc., Novartis and Pfizer, Inc.
2.Secondarily,
to a select group of global, diversified high performing companies with a five-year average return on equity of 18 percent or higher and similar to
Abbott in terms of size and/or scope of operations. This group currently includes 3M Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Caterpillar, The Coca-Cola Company, Colgate-Palmolive
Company, General Dynamics Corporation, General Mills, Inc., H.J. Heinz Company, Kellogg Company, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, McDonald's Corporation, Merck & Company, Inc.,
PepsiCo, Inc. and Procter & Gamble. 
Generally,
targets are set in a manner that references the median of the health care comparison group as an initial benchmark, but may be adjusted upon secondary reference to the
high-performing group. Specific pay rates, however, are based on an executive's profile, performance, experience, unique skills, and internal equity with others at Abbott. Once the rate of
pay is set in this manner at either hire or upon promotion or transfer, subsequent changes in pay, including salary increases, when appropriate, are based on the executive's performance, the job he or
she is performing or assuming, internal equity, and the Company's operating budget. In this sense, base pay is performance-based as well and is aligned with the individual's relative
contribution / performance and body of work. The external references have little, if any impact, once the initial position rate is established.

Annual Bonus 
All
of Abbott's five named officers participate in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (the "PIP"). The PIP is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. 
Each
year, maximum award allocations for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings are set. For 2010, the maximum award for the Chief Executive Officer was .0015 of adjusted
consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year-end for all of the other named officers, .00075 of adjusted consolidated net earnings. Historically, and in 2010, the Committee exercised its discretion
to deliver PIP awards that were below the maximum awards that are authorized in the Plan. 
Assessments
of performance against financial results take into account the impact of specified factors or events, and the appropriateness of these adjustments is reviewed annually. In 2010, specified
adjustments comprised of after-tax charges of $0.20 per share for acquired in-process research and development, $0.67 per share associated primarily with the acquisitions of
Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal Healthcare Solutions, including announced restructuring plans, as well as other cost reduction initiatives, $0.07 per share for litigation reserve, $0.06 per share
for costs of a product recall and drug withdrawal, $0.10 per share for an impairment of an intangible asset, $0.07 per share for the one-time impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan
Bolivar, and $0.04 per share for specific health care reform impact on deferred tax assets. 
In
making its determination regarding the actual award to all participants, the Committee considered pre-determined financial goals and individual goals, some of which were objective and
quantifiable, and other strategic or leadership goals for which their subjective assessment was not solely dictated by numeric or formulaic applications of measurable criteria. Moreover, while each
participant had
predetermined goals, the Committee also considered relative achievements, or developments (in the Company, marketplace and the global economy) that could not have been foreseen when individual goals
were written. 
Goals
that were specific for each named Executive Officer will be described separately. 
Long-Term Incentives 
Long-term
incentive targets are driven by two primary factors: first, internal equity and the executive's relative contribution to the Company's long-term success; secondly,
the Company's performance against both short- and long-term returns to shareholders, as well as relative performance against financial or operating measures that drive shareholder returns,
performance against strategic objectives, such as pipeline development or acquisitions (which may actually dilute returns in the short-term, but are, in the Committee's judgment, in the
best long-term interest of the Company and its shareholders). While long-term incentive awards may be awarded annually, the Committee's assessment includes one-,
three-, and five-year measures of a number of relative benchmarks, including total shareholder return, return on equity, return on net assets, and earnings per share growth. The results
are compared to both our direct health care competitors and the high performance reference group mentioned earlier. 
These
long-term measures are all taken into consideration without specific weighting. In aggregate, they provide the Committee with a relative performance rating of Abbott to peers on a
one-, three- and five-year period. Then, starting with the independent compensation consultant's recommendations regarding target or reference levels of appropriate
long-term incentive by individual, the Committee determines grants for each individual based on their objective and subjective assessment of performance, progress against strategic
milestones, and environmental factors, which affected the individual's or Company's performance. 
It
is important to note that while the Committee may target pay levels for a group of executives or a specific executive at, higher than, or below a certain performance percentile which the
independent compensation consultant may forecast, the actual awards are made without knowledge of the actual long-term incentive awards for the current performance period, since some
elements of competitors' actual performance and their actual compensation awards for the current performance period are unknown at the time of award. The independent compensation consultant's
long-term incentive information always reflects prior performance periods, so it is impossible at the time of the award to precisely predict where actual pay decisions will leave Abbott's
Executive Officers in comparison to others. 
Long-Term Incentives  Equity Awards 
For
2009, Abbott was the top ranked company for total shareholder return for the three-year performance period, and ranked second in the health care group on a five-year basis.
Based on the committee's assessment of this performance, the goals of the company's long-term incentive program, each individual's relative performance against his or her
pre-determined goals, current outstanding awards held by named officers and the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant, the Committee delivered long-term
incentive awards that were intended to, in aggregate, reflect performance above the median but less than the top quartile of the health care peer comparison group. 
Applying
these standards, the Committee determined the value for each named officer and made the awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table as shown on page 22 of this proxy statement. Further,
the Committee determined, in 2010, based on market practice, advice from its independent compensation consultant and in consideration of the recommendations of institutional shareholders, the
long-term incentive award for named officers should be in the form of 25 percent stock options and 75 percent performance-vested shares. 
Abbott's
policy with respect to its annual equity award for all employees, including the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Officers and all other officers of the company, is to grant this award and
set the grant price at the same time each year, at the Compensation 

15

 


Committee's regularly scheduled February meeting. These meeting dates are generally the third Friday of February and are scheduled two years in advance. In 2010, the annual grant was dated and the
grant price set on February 19th. The historical practice for setting the grant price is the average of the highest and lowest trading price of a common share on the date of the grant (rounded
up to the next even penny). The grant price for the 2010 annual grant was set at $54.50. The high, low and closing price of an Abbott common share on February 19th was $54.89, $54.08 and
$54.38, respectively. 
In
establishing criteria for performance vesting shares, the Committee considered the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant, and the fact that the secondary comparison of
"High-Performance Companies" is currently defined by five-year average return on equity of 18 percent or greater. 
Accordingly,
performance-based stock awards granted in 2010 will be earned (vested) over a period of up to five years, with not more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year,
dependent upon the company achieving an annual return on equity threshold of 18 percent from continuing operations adjusted for specified items per the quarterly earnings releases (which is
currently above the median of Abbott's Standard Industrial Classification peer group). If the thresholds are met in three of the five years, 100 percent of the performance shares will vest. If
the thresholds are missed in all five years, 100 percent of the performance shares will be forfeited. Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the same rate as all other shareholders.

GOAL PERFORMANCE AND 2010 COMPENSATION DECISIONS  

The individual goals described above are determined at the beginning of the year as part of the Company's annual performance and compensation planning process. The Committee considers, both at the
Company and individual level, achievement with respect to these goals, as well as the performance of the individual overall with respect to all matters not specifically defined in the
pre-determined goals, including leadership competencies and other individual contributions to Company performance on a qualitative basis. Additionally, the Committee may also consider
unforeseen circumstances or developments (in the Company, marketplace, and/or the global economy) that may have affected performance. 
For
each participant, a target bonus is set as follows: 
Base
Salary * Target Bonus Percent = Target Bonus Amount 
Actual
bonuses were above or below the target based on a comprehensive review of individual and corporate performance by the Committee, and its independent compensation consultant. 
To
determine each individual's annual bonus, the Committee considered the executive's target bonus, expressed as a percent of base pay, and made its final determination of the appropriate award at,
above or below the target, considering all of these factors, and in consultation with its independent compensation consultant. While the review is comprehensive, it is not solely formulaic. 
In
each case, for all of the named officers, and furthermore, all other Executive Officers not subject to this disclosure, there were multiple levels of review of the proposed award. For the CEO, the
Compensation Committee and the independent compensation consultant reviewed the proposed compensation. For the other named officers and other Executive Officers not subject to this disclosure, the
CEO, Compensation Committee and the Committee's independent compensation consultant reviewed the proposals.

performance-vesting restricted stock award and a 21,000 share retention-restricted stock award which vests upon the third anniversary of the award. 
Post Termination and Other Benefits  

Each of the benefits described below were chosen to support the company's objective of providing a total competitive pay program. Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other
benefits or pay components, except to the extent that all benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. Mr. Gonzalez, who had retired from Abbott in
2007, returned to work at Abbott in 2009. Upon his initial return to work at Abbott in 2009, and upon his interim appointment as EVP, Pharmaceutical Products in 2010, Mr. Gonzalez did not
resume participation in any of Abbott's employee benefits plans for active employees. Instead, he continues to receive Abbott retiree benefits, including pension and retiree healthcare benefits. 
Retirement Benefits  

The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan. As stated above,
Mr. Gonzalez is not accruing any additional benefits under these plans. These plans are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned "Pension Benefits." 
Since
officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust, officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in
present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited
amounts may be credited with the difference between the officer's actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8 percent). Amounts deposited in the
individual trusts are not tax deferred. Since amounts contributed to the trust have already been taxed, Abbott remits the tax owed on the income earned by the trust or any company adjustment paid to
the trust, thus preserving the parity of the benefit to those payable under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon retirement from
the company generally follows the manner elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse depending upon the pension distribution method elected by
the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan) live beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit and therefore exhaust the trust balance, the
Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid to the officer by Abbott. 
Deferred Compensation  

Officers of the company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary, on a pre-tax basis, to the company's qualified 401(k) plan, up to the IRS
contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18 percent of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan. All U.S. employees
may defer up to 18 percent as well, subject to IRS limits. One hundred percent (100 percent) of annual incentive awards earned under the company's Performance Incentive Plan are also
eligible for deferral to a non-qualified plan. Officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into
individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings equivalent to the average prime rate over the previous thirteen months plus
2.25 percent. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax deferred. Since amounts contributed to the trusts have already been taxed, Abbott remits the tax owed on the income earned
by the trusts or any company adjustment paid to the trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be 

18

 


distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the company. 
Change in Control Arrangements  

Messrs. White, Freyman and Gonzalez do not have change in control agreements, however, Abbott's other Executive Officers have individual change in control agreements. The purpose of these
agreements is to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the company and to protect
the earned benefits of the officer against adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practice
as confirmed by data provided the Committee by its independent compensation consultant. These arrangements are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy captioned "Potential Payments
Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Financial Planning  

Named officers are eligible for up to $10,000 of annual costs associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation and general financial planning fees. If an officer chooses to utilize this
benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation are paid by the company and are treated as imputed income to the officer who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due on the
fees paid by the company. 
Company Automobile  

U.S. named officers are eligible for use of a company-leased vehicle, with a lease term of 50 months. Seventy-five percent (75 percent) of the cost of the vehicle is imputed
to the officer as income for federal income tax purposes. 
Company Aircraft  

Non-business related flights on corporate aircraft by Messrs. White and Freyman are covered by time-sharing lease agreements, pursuant to which certain costs associated
with those flights are reimbursed by the executives to the Company in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. 
Disability Benefit  

In addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, the named officers are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is described in greater detail in the section of the
proxy captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES  

To further promote sustained shareholder return and to ensure the company's executives remain focused on both short and long-term objectives, the company has established share ownership
guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the position. The share ownership requirements are 175,000
shares for the Chief Executive Officer; 50,000 shares for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents and 25,000 shares for all other officers. All named officers meet or substantially exceed
the guidelines. 
As
provided in Abbott's Stock Incentive Program, no award may be assigned, alienated, sold or transferred otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified
domestic relations order or as permitted by the Committee for estate planning purposes, and no award and no right under any award, may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered. All
members of senior management, including the company's Executive Officers and certain other employees are required to clear any transaction involving company stock with the General Counsel prior to
entering into such transaction. 
COMPLIANCE  

The Performance Incentive Plan and Incentive Stock Program, which are described above, are intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) to ensure deductibility. 
The
Committee reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not
restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, the
Committee may from time to time approve components of compensation for certain officers that are not deductible. 
While
the Committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award decisions were based would occur, the Committee, in
evaluating such circumstances, has discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of shareholders up to and including actions to recover such incentive awards. Such circumstances
have never occurred. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT  

The Compensation Committee of the Board is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing Abbott's compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the committee's
independent consultant to establish Abbott's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and has
recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Compensation Risk Assessment  

During 2010, Abbott, through its Human Resources department in coordination with Internal Audit, conducted a risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for employees, including those
related to its executive compensation programs. Abbott's risk assessment included a qualitative and quantitative analysis of its employee compensation and benefit programs, including those for its
executive officers. Abbott also considered how these programs compare, from a design perspective, to programs maintained by other companies. Based on this assessment, Abbott determined its
compensation and benefit programs appropriately incent employees and any risks arising from its compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
Abbott. The following factors were among those considered in making this determination: 


Abbott's
long-established compensation structure has contributed to a corporate culture that encourages employees to regard Abbott as a career employer. For
example, Abbott's U.S. employees participate in an Abbott sponsored defined benefit pension plan. Equity awards (discussed in more detail below) also vest over multi-year periods. Both
forms of compensation encourage Abbott employees to consider the long-term impact of their decisions and align their interests with those of Abbott's shareholders.
Abbott's
long-term incentive program focuses executives on longer-term operating performance and shareholder returns. For 2010, Abbott's executive
officers received roughly 70% of their total compensation in the form of long-term equity incentives (25% of which are stock options, vesting over multi-year periods and 75% of
which are performance awards, which vest over a period of up to five years with not more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year). Abbott's officers do not receive any of their
long-term incentive compensation in cash.
Abbott's
annual incentive program places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other factors. Since earnings are a key component of stock
price performance, this aspect of Abbott's compensation plan also promotes alignment with shareholder interests.
Abbott
makes equity awards and sets grant prices at the same time each year, at the compensation committee's regularly scheduled meeting. In addition, Abbott does not award
discounted stock options or immediately vesting stock options or restricted stock.
Abbott
has share ownership guidelines for its officers, which promotes alignment with shareholder interests.
Abbott's
compensation committee has the ability to exercise downward discretion in determining annual incentive plan payouts. Historically, and in 2010, the compensation
committee exercised its discretion to deliver annual incentive plan awards below the maximums.
Abbott
requires mandatory training on its codes of conduct and policies and procedures to educate its employees on appropriate behaviors and the consequences of taking
inappropriate actions.
Abbott
does not include certain design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, including: over-weighting toward
annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable thresholds, and steep payout cliffs at certain levels that may encourage short-term business decisions to meet payout
thresholds. 

This
assessment was discussed with the compensation committee and its independent compensation consultant.

(1)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines grant date fair value by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott common share
on the award's date of grant.
(2)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts include the following aggregate grant date fair values attributable to replacement stock options issued in 2008 with respect to original option
grants made before 2005: M. D. White, $4,705,196; T. C. Freyman, $0; and, L. J. Schumacher, $233,158. None of the named officers received any replacement options in
2009 or 2010. Except for outstanding options that have a replacement option feature, options granted after 2004 do not include a replacement option feature. When the exercise price of an option with a
replacement option feature is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise price or the withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are
paid) with Abbott common shares held by the named officer, a replacement option may be granted for the number of shares used to make that payment. Abbott uses the closing price of an Abbott common
share on the business day before the exercise to determine the number of shares required to exercise the related option and the exercise price of the replacement option. The replacement option is
exercisable in full six months after the date of grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option. Other terms and conditions of the replacement option award are the same
in all material respects to those applicable to the original grant.
(3)These
amounts were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative
disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at
which employee stock options would be traded for cash. For options, other than replacement options, the assumptions are the same as those described in Note 8 entitled "Incentive Stock Program"
of 

22

 

Abbott's
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Abbott's 2010 Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission
Form 10-K. None of the named officers received any replacement options in 2009 or 2010. For the 2008 replacement options, the model used the following assumptions: expected
volatility of 20%; dividend yield ranging between 2.4% and 2.7%; risk-free interest ranging between 1.1% and 2.5%; and an option life equal to 60% of the option's remaining term. 


(4)This
compensation is earned as a performance-based incentive bonus, pursuant to the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan. Additional information regarding the
Performance Incentive Plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis  How Executive Pay Decisions Are
Made  Annual Bonus."

of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to Abbott's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Abbott matches participant contributions at the rate of 250% of the first 2% of
compensation contributed to the Plan. The named officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by the officer, net of maximum tax
withholdings.

(1)Each
of the named officers participates in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, an annual, non-equity incentive plan. The annual cash incentive award
earned by the named officer in 2010 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table under the column captioned "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No future payouts will be
made under the plan's 2010 annual cash incentive award. The Performance Incentive Plan is described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and
Analysis  How Executive Pay Decisions are Made  Annual Bonus."
(2)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a 5-year term and vest upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target, with no more than
one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2010, Abbott reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards made on February 19,
2010, vested on February 28, 2011. The equity targets are described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis  How Executive Pay
Decisions are Made  Long-Term Incentives  Equity Awards."
(3)In
the event of a grantee's death or disability or a change in control of Abbott, as defined in Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock programs, these awards are deemed fully earned.
Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the same rate as all other shares.
(4)These
are restricted shares granted as a retention award. These awards vest on February 19, 2013.
(5)One-third
of these shares vested on February 19, 2011. An additional third will vest on February 19, 2012. The final third will vest on February 19,
2013.
(6)These
shares will vest at the later of July 11, 2011 or the completion of Mr. Gonzalez's assignment as Executive Vice President, Pharmaceutical Products Group.
(7)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years. The options vest in the
event of the grantee's death or disability or a change in control of Abbott. Under the Abbott Laboratories 2009 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the average of
the high and low market prices (rounded-up to the next even penny) of an Abbott common share on the date of grant. These options do not contain a replacement option feature.
(8)Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of restricted shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an Abbott common
share on the grant date.
(9)These
values were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The model uses the assumptions described in Note 8, entitled
"Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" in Abbott's 2010 Annual Report on Securities
and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.

Pension Benefits  

The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature Abbott uses to attract officers who are at
the mid-point of their career. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have spent most of their
career at Abbott. Except as provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change in control
agreements are described on pages 37 and 38. 
The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 22. 
Annuity Retirement Plan  

The Annuity Retirement Plan covers most employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or
C below. 

A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied
by years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 

0.50%
of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of
benefit service. 


C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 
The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and
employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The
Annuity Retirement Plan covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired after 2003 who terminate
prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to
age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50
with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
The
Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Employees
who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with
10 years of service. Employees hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit service
total 70 or more. Messrs. White and Freyman are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching
age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit
is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement:

general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62
and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62.
Employees
who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age plus Seniority Service points
of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94 before age 65. Seniority
Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement applies, Seniority Service is used in
place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 12/3 percent for each year between ages 59
and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings 

33

 

portion
of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced
3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

Supplemental Pension Plan  

With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement Plan: 

Officers'
5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of payments under
Abbott's non-equity incentive plans.
The
Annuity Retirement Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of a
participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a participant under the
Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election as an officer, Abbott officers are no longer eligible to defer compensation
under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
In
addition to the benefits outlined above for the Annuity Retirement Plan, officers are eligible for a benefit equal to 0.6% of 5-year final average earnings
for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum percentage allowed under the
Annuity Retirement Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B and C above). The portion of this additional officer benefit attributable to service prior to 2004 is reduced 3 percent per year
for each year that payments are made before age 60. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 60 if the
participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65.
The
Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The benefits provided to officers under the
Supplemental Pension Plan are not, however, reduced for the period between age 60 and age 62, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. Messrs. White and Freyman are eligible
for early retirement benefits under the plan.
Vested
plan benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the officer. Consistent with the distribution
requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those officers who were elected prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan benefits funded through a
grantor trust. Officers elected after 2008 may only have the vested plan benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which the officer is first elected funded through a grantor trust. Vested
plan benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the participants' income. 
Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental
Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

(1)Abbott
calculates these present values using: (i) a 5.80% discount rate, the same discount rate it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 calculations for
financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's unreduced retirement age, which is age 62 under the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and age 60 under the Abbott Laboratories
Supplemental Pension Plan for those officers who are eligible for early retirement benefits and is age 65 under both plans for other officers. The present values shown in the table reflect
postretirement mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2000 Combined Healthy table), but do not include a factor for preretirement termination,
mortality, or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan benefits, to the extent not previously
funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the officer's individual trust are expected to offset Abbott's
obligations to the officer under the plan. During 2010, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established by the named officers.
(3)Mr.
Gonzalez is not accruing any further benefits under these plans. Mr. Gonzalez retired from Abbott in 2007 and began receiving payments from the Abbott Laboratories Annuity
Retirement Plan and distributions from his Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust. When he returned to work at Abbott in 2009, these payments and distributions continued. Grantor
trusts are described in greater detail in footnote (2) and in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisGoal Performance and 2010
Compensation DecisionsRetirement Benefits".

2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation  

The following table summarizes J. V. Mazzo's non-qualified deferred compensation under two Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. ("AMO") plans: the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and
the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. These plans were in place when Abbott acquired control of AMO on February 25, 2009. None of the other named officers has any
non-qualified deferred compensation. Neither J. V. Mazzo nor Abbott have made contributions to the plans since Abbott acquired control of AMO.

(1)Employee
contributions to the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan stopped in 2004.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 100% of their base salary and annual cash incentives and credited a participant's account with an amount equal to the employer matching
contributions that would have been made for the participant under AMO's tax-qualified defined contribution plan, if certain Internal Revenue Code limitations did not apply.
(3)Under
the plans, participants may direct the investment of their deferral account into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and their deferral account is credited
with investment returns based on the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2010, the weighted average rate of return credited to Mr. Mazzo's accounts was 8.1 percent. 

The
plans permit cash distributions either in the form of a lump sum payment or installments upon retirement (defined as age 55 with a minimum of five years of service, or age 65 with a minimum of one
year of service), termination of employment, or death. Participants make
distribution elections each year, prior to any deferrals being made for that year, and only for the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year. Under the 2005 plan, Mr. Mazzo's
distributions must also comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants may make withdrawals due to financial hardship, with the amount being limited to the
amount needed to address the hardship. 
(4)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(5)Because
they relate to contributions made prior to Abbott's acquisition of AMO, none of the amounts included in this column have been previously reported as compensation in Abbott's
prior Summary Compensation Tables.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control  
Potential Payments Upon Termination  Generally  

Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. It formerly had an employment agreement with J. V. Mazzo. That agreement, which has now expired, is described in footnote 8 of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 24. 
The
following summarizes the payments that the named officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2010. Earnings, fees, and tax payments would have continued
to be paid for the named officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully distributed and fees would have
continued to be paid for the named officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust, until its assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the period over which the
trusts' assets were distributed, tax rates, and the trusts' earnings and fees. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current tax rates, earnings, and
fees, the named officers would receive the following average annual payments over such 10-year period: M. D. White, $781,213; T. C. Freyman, $74,889; L. J.
Schumacher, $177,391; and J. V. Mazzo, $7,617. Pursuant to an election made at the time of his retirement in 2007, Mr. Gonzalez's trust assets began to be distributed over a 35-year period when
he retired. Based on current tax rates, earnings and fees, and assuming the distributions continue during the remaining 32 years of the distribution period, he will receive an average annual
payment of $282,641 over the distribution period. In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for each of the
following named officers, respectively, M. D. White, $4,899,153; T. C. Freyman, $1,104,669; L. J. Schumacher, $263,798; and, J. V. Mazzo, $118,917. As Messrs. White and Freyman are eligible to
retire, each of them would be eligible to begin to receive the pension benefits described on pages 33 to 35. If the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers
also would have received, in addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability benefit in the amount of $154,167 for M. D. White; $50,000 for T. C. Freyman;
$45,833 for L. J. Schumacher; and $16,000 for J. V. Mazzo. This long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 18 months following termination of employment. It ends if the
officer retires, recovers, dies or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In
addition, if the named officer's employment had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31, 2010 with
values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards." 
Potential Payments Upon Change in Control  

Messrs. White, Freyman, and Gonzalez do not have change in control agreements with Abbott. 
Abbott
has change in control arrangements with the rest of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for other key management
personnel. The agreements with Ms. Schumacher and Mr. Mazzo are described below. 
The
agreements with Ms. Schumacher and Mr. Mazzo, continue in effect until December 31, 2013, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year
thereafter unless Abbott notifies the officer that the agreement will not be extended. The agreements also automatically extend for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs
while they are in effect. 
The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) or within two years
following a change in control of Abbott (including termination by the officer for any reason during the thirty-day window period which begins six months after the date of a change in
control), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this purpose that all target
performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for
any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed
performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason during a
potential change in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of the bonus to which the
officer is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the potential change in
control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer in the preceding
three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also
receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits; three years of outplacement services and tax and financial counseling; and the value of three more years of
pension accruals), and payment of any 

37

 


excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and other related taxes for which the officer is responsible as a result of receiving payments and benefits in connection
with a change in control. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the
remainder of their term. Independent compensation consultants confirm that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market practice. 
For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the
outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the board of directors whose appointment was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under
the agreements includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the
executive's position, duties, or authority; the company's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of the company's
principal executive offices to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2010, immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Ms. Schumacher and Mr. Mazzo would have been
entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements: 

Ms. Schumacher,
Cash termination payments  $6,882,500; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits  $617,735; Welfare and
fringe benefits  $94,000; Excise tax reimbursements  $4,049,511.
Mr. Mazzo,
Cash termination payments  $3,988,500; Additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits  $637,120; Welfare and fringe
benefits  $94,000. 
To
determine the amount of the officer's excise tax reimbursement, Abbott has assumed that the named officer pays taxes at the highest marginal tax rate; that the price of an Abbott common share is
equal to the closing price of an Abbott common share on December 31, 2010; and that a portion of the payments and benefits is not subject to excise tax. 
Accelerated Vesting of Equity Awards  

Under the Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, upon a change in control, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units vest, including performance-based
restricted shares, which are deemed earned in full. If a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2010: 

Mr. White
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 688,332 unvested stock options with a value of $0, and (2) in an aggregate of 398,331 restricted
shares with a value equal to $19,084,038.
Mr. Freyman
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 201,733 unvested stock options with a value of $0, and (2) in an aggregate of 152,666 restricted
shares with a value equal to $7,314,228.
Mr. Gonzalez
would have vested in an aggregate of 137,333 restricted shares with a value equal to $6,579,624.
Ms. Schumacher
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 138,099 unvested stock options with a value of $0, and (2) in an aggregate of 111,199 restricted
shares with a value equal to $5,327,544.
Mr. Mazzo
would have vested (1) in an aggregate of 28,700 unvested stock options with a value of $0, and (2) in an aggregate of 60,600 restricted shares with a value
equal to $2,903,346. 
The
value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of an Abbott common share on December 31, 2010 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of
unvested stock options held by the named officer. The value of restricted shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted shares that would vest as of December 31, 2010 and
the closing price of an Abbott common share on December 31, 2010. 

38


   




Approval Process for Related Person Transactions  

It is Abbott's policy that the nominations and governance committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott participates and in which any related person has a direct or indirect
material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related person transactions requiring review by the nominations
and governance committee pursuant to this policy are identified in: 

questionnaires
annually distributed to Abbott's directors and officers;
certifications
submitted annually by Abbott officers related to their compliance with Abbott's Code of Business Conduct; or
communications
made directly by the related person to the chief financial officer or general counsel. 
In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the nominations and governance committee will consider the following items, among others: 

the
related person's relationship to Abbott and interest in the transaction;
the
material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal involved;
the
benefits to Abbott of the transaction;
if
applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services;
an
assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally;
whether
a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and
whether
the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 
This
process is included in the nominations and governance committee's written charter, which is available on the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations Web site
(www.abbottinvestor.com). Abbott did not have any related person transactions in 2010 requiring nominations and governance committee approval under this policy.

Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Auditors (Item 2 on Proxy Card)  

Abbott's bylaws provide that the audit committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as auditors. In October 2010, the audit committee appointed
Deloitte & Touche LLP to act as auditors for 2011. Deloitte & Touche LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2002. 
Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors
for 2011. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for 2011, the
audit committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as auditors for
2011.
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to
do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees  

The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Limited, and their respective affiliates (the
"Deloitte Entities") for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and fees billed for other services rendered by the
Deloitte Entities during these periods.

included in Abbott's quarterly reports, and the audits of Abbott's internal control over financial reporting, statutory and subsidiary audits, the review of documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and certain accounting consultations in connection with the audits.
(2)Audit
related fees include: accounting consultations and audits in connection with proposed acquisitions and divestitures, and audits of certain employee benefit plans' financial
statements.
(3)Tax
fees consist principally of professional services rendered by the Deloitte Entities for tax compliance and tax planning and advice including assistance with tax audits and
appeals, and tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions.
(4)No

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Auditor  

The audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the Deloitte Entities. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public
accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the
independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific
pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The
audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to
the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.

Report of the Audit Committee  
Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the
consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this context, the Audit
Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public
accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61
(Communication with Audit Committees), as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 40 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit
Fees" is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Say on Pay  An Advisory Vote on the Approval of Executive Compensation (Item 3 on Proxy Card)  

Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis,
the compensation tables and related material included in this proxy statement. 
This
vote is advisory and non-binding. However, the board of directors and compensation committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results. 
Abbott's
executive compensation program and compensation paid to the named officers are described on pages 13 to 38 of this proxy statement. The compensation committee oversees the program and
compensation awarded, adopting changes to the program and awarding compensation as appropriate to reflect Abbott's circumstances and to promote the main objectives of the program: to provide
competitive overall pay relative to peers, taking into account company performance, to effectively tie pay to performance, and to align the named officer's interests with shareholders. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers' compensation.  

42

 


Say When on Pay  An Advisory Vote on the Approval of the Frequency of Shareholder Votes on Executive Compensation
(Item 4 on Proxy Card)  

Shareholders are being asked to vote on how often Abbott should present shareholders with the opportunity to vote on the compensation awarded to its named officers. 
Abbott
believes that an annual vote is most appropriate. 
You
may vote to have this vote held annually, every two years, or every three years, or you may abstain. The vote is advisory and non-binding. 
The
compensation committee will consider the outcome, along with other relevant factors, in recommending a voting frequency to the board of directors. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR an annual (1 year) shareholder advisory vote about compensation awarded to Abbott's
named officers.

43

 


Shareholder Proposal  

One shareholder proposal has been received. Abbott is advised that the proposal will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed resolution and the statement made in support thereof
are presented on the following page. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

The Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth, P.O. Box 476, Convent Station, NJ 07961-0476, and 20 other proponents have informed Abbott that they intend to present the
following proposal at the meeting. Abbott will provide the proponents' names and addresses to any shareholder who requests that information and, if provided by a proponent to Abbott, the number of
Abbott common shares held by that proponent. 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors create and implement a policy of price restraint on branded pharmaceuticals, utilizing a
combination of approaches to keep drug prices at reasonable levels, such as an increase that would not exceed the previous year's Consumer Price Index, and report to shareholders by September 2011 on
changes in policies and pricing procedures for pharmaceutical products (withholding any competitive information, and at reasonable cost). 

Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal  
WHEREAS:
The
cost of brand name drugs, some of them our Company's, have skyrocketed in this country in recent years; 
The
government's General Accountability Office (GAO) found that between 2000-2008, 416 brand-name drugs had "extraordinary price increases"; most of these increases ranged from
100% to 499%; 
Medco's
2010 Drug Trend Report found that, while generic drug prices increased 0.3%, "inflation in branded drugs accelerated to an all-time high of 9.2%" and that the prices of specialty
drugs increased 14.7%; 
The
Office of Actuary, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that prescription drug expenditures will increase in 2018 92.7% from 2008 expenditures, exceeding all major categories of
national health expenditures. It states: "Prescription drug spending is expected to be the fast growing component of Medicare over the projection period"; 
AARP's
Public Policy Institute reported that the price of brand name prescriptions most widely used by Medicare beneficiaries increased by 9.7% in the 12 months ending with March 2010 and was
much higher than the rate of increase observed during any of the prior eight years (2002-2009). While inflation rose 0.3% during this period, price increases for such drugs ranged from
5.3-9.3%; 
AARP
has also stated that the positive goals of the new health care reform law "could be eroded over the years if escalating drug prices are not addressed"; 
While
passage of health reform legislation was a major achievement, there are ongoing concerns as to its long-term affordability and accountability for controlling costs. Failure to
control costs could undermine the goals of health care reform, i.e. accessible and affordable health care for all; 
This
resolution's sponsors are not satisfied that the Company has made a clear case offering fiscal and moral justification for such exorbitant price increases. Neither has it given sufficient
assurances that the present pattern of increases that far exceed the Consumer Price Index will not continue. 

Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Pharmaceutical Pricing (Item 5 on Proxy Card)  

Access to affordable medicines requires the efforts of many parties, including government, health care professionals, health care companies and patients. The Company partners with a wide range of
organizations to address the challenges of health care accessibility and affordability. It also takes a responsible approach to the pricing of its pharmaceutical products, considering a multitude of
factors in determining the appropriate price for its products. Adopting a policy, such as the one proposed by proponents, would undermine prudent business practices and eliminate the flexibility
necessary to respond to changing market dynamics, product dynamics and geographies. 
The
Company's pricing determinations for its pharmaceutical products consider research and development costs, for the product and overall, manufacturing and quality assurance costs, therapeutic value
of the product, market dynamics and government regulations. Pricing determinations are carefully considered when initially established and in any subsequent pricing actions. 
Additionally,
the Company engages in multiple public-private partnerships designed to expand access to affordable medicine. For example, we offer a variety of Patient Assistance Programs to provide
free or low-cost medicines to eligible patients. In 2010 alone, more than 160,000 patients received Abbott medicines valued at approximately $450 million through these programs.
Abbott has also partnered with patient groups at both the state and federal levels to help secure coverage for economically disadvantaged patients. For instance, we worked with oncology organizations
to secure Medicare coverage for patients using oral cancer medicines, and with arthritis patients to secure coverage for self-injectible medicines. 
The
Company's efforts to ensure and expand access to pharmaceutical products is described in our Global Citizenship Report. Accordingly, the report proposed by proponents is unnecessary. Furthermore,
it would be inappropriate and contrary to the best interests of Abbott and our shareholders to adopt the price restraint policy outlined in this proposal. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  

Abbott believes that during 2010 its officers and directors complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Other Matters  

In accordance with Abbott's articles of incorporation, Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of two current and five former officers in connection with the United States Department of Justice's
criminal and civil investigation of Abbott's Depakote sales and marketing activities. Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of a current officer in connection with AMO. 

Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2012 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement  

Shareholder proposals for presentation at the 2012 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 16, 2011 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2012 meeting. 

Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting  

A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and governance committee or the secretary
of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these
procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on: 

the
record date for that Annual Meeting,
the
date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and
the
date of the Annual Meeting, 
may
directly nominate persons for director by providing proper timely written notice to the secretary of Abbott. 
That
notice must include the name, age, business address, residence address and principal occupation or employment of the nominee, the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominee and any
other information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations for proxies pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. In addition, the notice must include the name and
record address of the nominating shareholder and the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominating shareholder. 
A
shareholder of record on the record date for an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and on the date of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders may
properly bring business before the Annual Meeting by providing timely written notice to the secretary of Abbott. For each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice
must include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such
business, the class and number of shares of Abbott owned by the shareholder and any material interest of the shareholder in such business. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's principal executive offices not less
than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within
twenty-five days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such
notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for the 2012
Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by Abbott no later than January 30, 2012.
