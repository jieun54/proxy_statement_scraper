May 10, 2016, when her term expires.

DIRECTOR NOMINEES SKILLS AND
EXPERIENCE
The Nominating and Governance Committee
identifies, reviews, and recommends nominees to the Board for approval. The
Committee seeks individuals with distinguished records of leadership and success
and who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committee considers a wide
range of factors and experiences, including ensuring an experienced, qualified
Board with expertise in the following areas relevant to 3M. The numbers in
parentheses represent the number of director nominees who possess each of the
skills and experiences.

Table of
Contents


SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
      ACTIONS
We recently implemented several changes
that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong corporate governance
practices:
Proxy Access
In November 2015, the Board adopted a
new Proxy Access for Director Nominations bylaw that permits eligible
stockholders to include in our proxy statement nominees for election to the 3M
Board. Our decision to adopt proxy access grew out of an open and constructive
dialogue with our stockholders, and we believe our proxy access framework
strikes the right balance for 3M by ensuring that stockholder nominees to the
Board are supported by long-term stockholders representing a significant, but
attainable, proportion of outstanding shares. For additional information, please
see page 16 in this Proxy Statement.
Board Refreshment
We regularly add directors to infuse
new ideas and fresh perspectives into the boardroom. In recruiting directors, we
focus on how the experience and skill set of each individual complements those
of their fellow directors to create a balanced board with diverse
viewpoints and backgrounds, deep expertise, and strong leadership experience.
Accordingly, we are pleased to announce the following directors who will be
standing for election to the Board for the first time at the Annual Meeting.
David B. Dillon joined the Board in August 2015, and Gregory R. Page and
Patricia A. Woertz joined the Board in February 2016. All three are accomplished
business leaders with significant experience directly relevant to 3Ms strategic
vision and business strategies. David B. Dillon is the retired Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of The Kroger Co. and brings vast experience
in leading one of the worlds largest retailers and a strong understanding of
the customers point of view. Gregory A. Page is the retired Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Cargill, Incorporated and brings
exceptional experience in running a complex global business. Patricia A. Woertz
is the retired Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and brings considerable experience in creating
stockholder value, global operations, and risk management.

the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended December 31, 2015. For additional
information, see Total Stockholder Return on page 38 of this Proxy
Statement.
Throughout 2015, we also continued to
prepare and position our Company for long-term success. Other noteworthy
accomplishments include the following:
●Expanded full-year margins 50 basis points to 22.9 percent in
a low-growth external environment 
●Completed three strategic acquisitions (Capital Safety, Ivera
Medical Corp., and Polypore International Inc.s Separations Media business) to
strengthen our portfolio and complement organic growth 
●Invested nearly $7 billion in our business through a
combination of capital expenditures ($1.5 billion), research and development
($1.8 billion), and acquisitions ($3.7 billion, inclusive of debt)
●Returned $7.8 billion to stockholders via dividends and gross
share repurchases 
●Opened our new state-of-the-art research and development
laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota 
●Launched our new brand platform3M Science. Applied to
Lifeto enhance awareness of how 3M uses science to improve lives 
●Completed a corporate restructuring to increase efficiency and
further strengthen our competitiveness

SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION ACTIONS
      DURING 2015
During 2015, 3M and the Compensation
Committee made the following decisions and took the following actions with
respect to the Companys executive compensation program:


●

Amended the Annual Incentive Plan
      (effective for 2015) to reduce the maximum payout from 300 percent to 200
      percent of the participants target amount. 

●

Revised the weighting of the
      three performance metrics used in the Annual Incentive Plan (effective for
      2015) to increase alignment to overall corporate results and initiatives.
      The new weightings are as follows: Local Currency Sales vs. Plan (50
      percent), Economic Profit vs. Plan (20 percent), and 3M Economic Profit
      vs. Prior Year (30 percent). 

●

Revised the performance criteria
      for new performance share awards (effective for 2015 performance share
      awards) to better align this portion of our executives long-term
      incentive compensation with the long-term financial objectives previously
      announced by the Company. In particular, the 2015 performance share awards
      utilize two new performance criteria (earnings per share growth and free
      cash flow conversion) that replace the New Product Vitality Index. With
      this change, all four performance criteria used for the 2015 performance
      share awards are now aligned with the Companys publicly-stated long-term
      financial objectives.

●

Effective with performance share
      awards made in 2015, began adjusting the initial grant value of each
      executives performance share award to reflect their individual
      performance during the preceding year. In the past, individual performance
      affected only target annual incentive compensation and the annual stock
      option grant. This change was made to better recognize and encourage
      exceptional individual performance.

●

Amended the definition of
      Retirement in our Annual Incentive Plan and our 2008 Long-Term Incentive
      Plan effective as of January 1, 2016, to mean a termination of employment
      with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of service.
      Prior to this change, the term Retirement meant a termination of
      employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least five
      years of service. This change was made to encourage longer service to the
      Company. The previous definition continues to apply to awards granted
      under our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan before January 1,
    2016.

CORPORATEGOVERNANCE AT 3M
PROPOSAL NO. 1: ELECT THE TWELVE DIRECTORS
IDENTIFIED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT
At the 2016 Annual Meeting, twelve
directors are to be elected to hold office until the 2017 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. All
nominees are presently 3M directors who were elected by stockholders at the 2015
Annual Meeting, except for David Dillon, Gregory Page, and Patricia Woertz, who
were elected to the Board in August 2015 (Mr. Dillon) and February 2016 (Mr.
Page and Ms. Woertz) and who are standing for election for the first time. The
Nominating and Governance Committee, with input from the independent directors
and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, identified Ms. Woertz
and Messrs. Dillon and Page with the assistance of an outside search firm, and
recommended them to the Board. We expect each nominee for election as a director
to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies
will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for
substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors
serving on the Board. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office
until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her
earlier death, resignation, or retirement. Linda
Alvarado is not seeking re-election and will end her service on the 3M Board on
May 10, 2016, when her term expires. We thank Ms. Alvarado for her many
contributions to the Board and to the Company. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee
reviewed the Board Membership Criteria (described on page 14) and the specific
experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of each nominee, including
membership(s) on the boards of directors of other public companies. The
following pages contain biographical and other information about the nominees.
Following each nominees biographical information, we have provided information
concerning the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills
that led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that
each nominee should serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our
directors serve or have served on boards and board committees (including as
committee chairs) of other public companies, which the Board believes provides
them with additional board leadership and governance experience, exposure to
best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the
functioning of our Board.

BOARD
MEMBERSHIP CRITERIA
3Ms Corporate Governance Guidelines
contain Board Membership Criteria which include a list of skills and
characteristics expected to be represented on 3Ms Board. The Nominating and
Governance Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills
and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board
composition. It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a
high performance organization creating competitive advantage for the Company. To
perform as such, the Board will be composed of individuals who have
distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena of activity and
who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committees and the Boards
assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of: 


●
Roles in and contributions valuable to the
      business community;

●
Personal qualities of leadership, character,
      judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout
      service on the Board a reputation in the community at large of integrity,
      trust, respect, competence, and adherence to the highest ethical
    standards;

●
Relevant knowledge and diversity of background
      and experience in business, manufacturing, technology, finance and
      accounting, marketing, international business, government, and other
      areas; and

●
Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and
      has the time required for preparation, participation, and attendance at
      all meetings.
In addition to these minimum
requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominees skills are
complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for
particular expertise in certain areas, and will assess the nominees impact on
Board dynamics and effectiveness.

DIVERSITY
The Board of Directors values diversity
as a factor in selecting nominees to serve on the Board because its experience
is that diversity provides significant benefit to the Board and the Company.
Although there is no specific policy on diversity, the Committee considers the
Board Membership Criteria in selecting nominees for directors, including
diversity of background and experience. Such considerations may include gender,
race, national origin, functional background, executive or professional
experience, and international experience.



IDENTIFICATION, EVALUATION, AND SELECTION OF
      NOMINEES
The Committee periodically reviews the
appropriate size and composition of the Board and anticipates future vacancies
and needs of the Board. In the event the Committee recommends an increase in the
size of the Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified
nominees from several sources, including current Board members and nominees
recommended by stockholders and other persons.
The Committee may from time to time
retain a director search firm to help the Committee identify qualified director
nominees for consideration by the Committee. The Committee retained Spencer
Stuart in 2015 to help identify future Board candidates.
The Committee evaluates qualified
director nominees at regular or special Committee meetings against the Board
Membership Criteria described above then in effect and reviews qualified
director nominees with the Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board
interview candidates that meet the Board Membership Criteria and the Committee
selects nominees that best suit the Boards current needs and recommends one or
more of such individuals for election to the Board.
DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE
The Board has adopted a formal set of
Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director
independence, which either conform to or are more exacting than the independence
requirements of the NYSE listing standards, and the full text of which is
available on our Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations 
Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines, a director or nominee for
director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company
other than as a director. The Guidelines specify the criteria by which the
independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines
for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment
or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting
firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation Committee members from
having any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and
restrict both commercial and not-for-profit relationships of all directors with
the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit
by the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arms length with
the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose
any circumstance that might be perceived as a conflict of interest.
In accordance with these Guidelines,
the Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this
review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each
director, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most recent three completed fiscal
years. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or
relationships between the Company and a director or any members of a directors
immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family
member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder).
The Board considered that in the ordinary course of business, transactions may
occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of
our directors are or have been officers. In particular, the Board considered the
annual amount of sales to 3M for each of the most recent three completed fiscal
years by each of the companies where directors serve or have served as an executive
officer, as well as purchases by those companies from 3M. The Board determined
that the amount of sales and purchases in each fiscal year was below one percent
of the annual revenues of each of those companies, the threshold set forth in
the Director Independence Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable
contributions to not-for-profit organizations with which our directors or
immediate family members are affiliated, none of which approached the threshold
set forth in our Director Independence Guidelines.
As a result of this review, the Board
affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent under
these Guidelines: Linda G. Alvarado, Sondra L. Barbour, Thomas Tony K. Brown,
Vance D. Coffman, David B. Dillon, Michael L. Eskew, Herbert L. Henkel, Muhtar
Kent, Edward M. Liddy, Gregory R. Page, Robert J. Ulrich, and Patricia A.
Woertz. The Board has also determined that members of the Audit Committee and
Compensation Committee received no compensation from the Company other than for
service as a director. Inge G. Thulin, Chairman of the Board, President and
Chief Executive Officer, is considered to not be independent because of his
employment by the Company.

ROLE OF THE
NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE
The Nominating and Governance Committee

members in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria set forth below, and
recommends selected individuals to the Board for nomination to stand for
election at the next meeting of stockholders of the Company in which directors
will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on the Board between meetings
of stockholders, the Committee seeks to identify individuals who the Committee
believes are qualified to become Board members in accordance with the Board
Membership Criteria set forth below, and may recommend one or more of such
individuals for appointment to the Board. The Nominating and Governance
Committee also focuses on overall Board-level succession planning at the
director level.

    PRACTICES

 


  Board Independence

 


✓Substantial
      majority of independent directors  twelve of our thirteen        directors are independent of the Company and management
       and all are        highly qualified.
✓Independent
      directors regularly meet in executive sessions without
      management.
✓Independent
      directors have complete access to management and
      employees.
✓Regularly refresh
      Board; added 6 new directors in past 4 years; average director tenure is
      6.8 years.

 

  Board Committee Independence and
      Expertise

 


✓Committee
      independence  Only independent directors serve on the Boards committees
      with independent committee chairs empowered to establish committee
      agendas.
✓Committee executive
      sessions  at each regularly scheduled meeting, members of the Audit
      Committee, Compensation Committee, Finance Committee, and Nominating and
      Governance Committee meet in executive session.
✓Financial expertise
       All members of the Audit Committee meet the NYSE listing standards for
      financial expertise, and six of the seven members are audit committee
      financial experts under SEC rules.

      stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, continuously owning for
      3 years at least 3 percent of our
      outstanding common shares may
      nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two
      directors and 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving, if
      the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the bylaw
      requirements.

      policies and criteria for director nominations, including candidates recommended by
      stockholders.

    Board.

 


Stockholder Outreach and
      Engagement


✓We maintain a
      vigorous stockholder engagement program. During 2015, members of senior
      management met with a cross-section of stockholders owning approximately
      35 percent of our outstanding shares. The feedback from those meetings was shared with the
      Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board and helped inform the
      Boards decision to adopt proxy access bylaws in November
      2015.


 


Risk Oversight


✓Broad risk oversight
      by the Board and its committees, with committee-level risk analyses
      reported to the full Board and senior-level internal auditor and Chief
      Compliance Officer appointed by, and reporting directly to, the Audit
      Committee.


 


Board
      Approved Long-Term Strategic Plans and Capital Allocation
      Strategies

✓

Each year management presents to
      the Board, and the Board discusses and approves, detailed long-term
      strategic plans for the Company, the international business, and each of
      the Companys business groups. Each presentation includes an overview of
      the business group, the financial performance, an assessment of the
      portfolio for growth opportunities using a SWOT analysis (i.e., strengths,
      weaknesses, opportunities, and threats); strategic priorities to drive the
      three key value creation leversPortfolio Management, Investing in
      Innovation, and Business Transformation; plans to drive the four corporate
      fundamental strengthsTechnology, Manufacturing, Global Capabilities, and
      Brand; and the projected long-term financial performance.

✓

The Board also approves the
      long-term capital structure of the Company to ensure that there is
      sufficient capital to invest for future growth.


   
●

The Company is committed to
      investing in organic growth, most notably through capital expenditures and
      research and development. The Company has invested approximately $16
      billion in capital expenditures and research and development to support
      and fund organic growth over the past 5 years. 3M has opened six customer
      technical centers around the world, and a new, state-of-the-art research
      and development laboratory in the United States.


 
●

The capital allocation plans have
      flexibility to respond quickly to strategic acquisition opportunities that
      can strengthen the Companys portfolio. Over the past 5 years, 3M has
      invested approximately $6 billion in strategic acquisitions to build upon
      and strengthen its business portfolio for continued future
      growth.



●

The Company has a long history of
      returning cash to stockholders, having paid nearly $10 billion in
      dividends over the past 5 years.



●

Finally, share repurchases
      represent the last component of 3Ms capital allocation plans. Over the
      past 5 years, 3M has returned approximately $21 billion to stockholders
      via share repurchases.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
The Board has adopted Corporate
Governance Guidelines which provide a framework for the effective governance of
the Company. The guidelines address matters such as the respective roles and
responsibilities of the Board and management, the Boards leadership structure,
the responsibilities of the independent Lead Director, director independence,
the Board Membership Criteria, Board committees, and Board and management
evaluation. The Boards Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for
overseeing and reviewing the Guidelines at least annually and recommending any
proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Corporate Governance Guidelines,
the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the charters of the Board
committees, the Director Independence Guidelines, and
the Codes of Conduct provide the framework for the governance of the Company and
are available on our Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations 
Governance.
BOARDS ROLE IN
RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board has delegated to the Audit
Committee through its charter the primary responsibility for the oversight of
risks facing the Company. The Audit Committees charter provides that the Audit
Committee shall discuss policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment
and risk management, the Companys major risk exposures and the steps management
has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.
2016 Proxy
Statement  |  19


Table of
Contents
The Vice President and General Auditor,
Corporate Auditing (the Auditor), whose appointment and performance is
reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee and who has direct reporting
obligations to the Committee, is responsible for leading the formal risk
assessment and management process within the Company. The Auditor, through
consultation with the Companys senior management, periodically assesses the
major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible for
managing each specific risk. The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit
Committee the major risks facing the Company and the steps management has taken
to monitor and mitigate those risks. The Auditors risk management report, which
is provided in advance of the meeting, is reviewed with the entire Board by
either the chair of the Audit Committee or the Auditor. The executive
responsible for managing a particular risk may also report to the full Board on
how the risk is being managed and mitigated.
While the Boards oversight of risk
primarily is performed by the Audit Committee, the Board has delegated to other
committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and
expertise. For example, the Compensation Committee oversees risks associated
with the Companys compensation practices, including by performing an annual
review of the Companys risk assessment of its compensation policies and
practices for its employees. The Finance Committee oversees risks associated
with the Companys capital structure, credit ratings and cost of capital,
long-term benefit obligations, and use of or investment in financial products,
such as derivatives to manage risk related to foreign currencies, commodities,
and interest rates. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks
associated with the Companys overall governance and its succession planning
process to ensure that the Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates
for key management positions.
The Board believes that its oversight
of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee, but also through
delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their areas of
responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full
Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company
like 3M. The chair of each committee that oversees risk provides a summary of
the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each
committee meeting. The minutes of each committee meeting are also provided to
all Board members. The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by
its current leadership structure (discussed above) because the CEO, who is
ultimately responsible for the Companys management of risk, also chairs regular
Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company,
the CEO is best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Boards
attention.
MANAGEMENT
SUCCESSION PLANNING
The Board plans the succession to the
position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions. To assist the
Board, the Chairman/CEO and Senior Vice President of Human Resources annually
assesses senior managers and their succession potential for the position of
Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions.
COMMUNICATION WITH
DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors has adopted the
following process for stockholders and other interested parties to send
communications to members of the Board. Stockholders and other interested
parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board, or
with any of our other independent directors, or all of them as a group, by
sending a letter to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M
Center, Building 220-14W-06, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.


COMPLIANCE
3MS CODES OF
CONDUCT
More than a century of operating with
uncompromising integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility
with our communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our employees,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief
Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3Ms Code of Conduct to ensure that
our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. These
policies form the foundation of a comprehensive
process that includes compliance with corporate policies and procedures and a
Company-wide focus on uncompromising integrity in every aspect of our
operations. Our Code of Conduct covers many topics, including antitrust and
competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting, protection of
confidential information, and compliance with all laws and regulations
applicable to the conduct of our business.
20  |  3M


Table of
Contents
Employees are required to report any
conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of
the Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive,
retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous
submission by employees or others of concerns regarding questionable accounting
or auditing matters. Information on how to submit any such communications can be
found on 3Ms Investor Relations Web site, under Governance  Governance
Documents  Employee Business Conduct Policies  Report a concern or ask a
question.
The Board also has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for
directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing principles of
conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure the Companys business and
the activities of the Board are conducted with integrity and adherence to the
highest ethical standards, and in compliance with the law.
The Companys Code of Conduct for
employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are
available on our Web site at www.3M.com under Investor Relations  Governance 
Governance Documents.
PUBLIC POLICY
ENGAGEMENT
The Company believes that transparency
with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement
with lawmakers is important to our stockholders, and continuously makes efforts
to give our stockholders useful information about our public policy engagement.
Since 2007 (and updated several times since then), the Company has voluntarily
published a detailed explanation of the Companys political activities which is
available on our Web site at www.3M.com under Investor Relations  Governance 
Governance Documents  Political Activities and
Issue Advocacy. There, the Company sets out in detail its positions on
important public policy issues, the factors we consider when making political
contributions, and the processes we use for legal, financial, executive, and
Board oversight of our political activities and contributions. We also provide
links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files monthly with the
Federal Election Commission and the Companys quarterly Lobbying Disclosure
reports, as well as a detailed list of our contributions to state candidates and
political parties, and contributions to 527 political organizations. The
Company also discloses on its Web site the trade associations the Company joined
where $25,000 or more of the dues are allocated for lobbying purposes by the
trade association. The Company believes that these disclosures on our Web site,
which exceed the disclosures required by law, offer transparency respecting the
Companys public policy engagement and political activities.
COMMITMENT TO THE
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
At 3M, we are working hard to help
create a better world for people everywhere. We apply our ingenuity, our
expertise, and our technology to solve problems innovatively, and with a focus
on solutions for the longer term. Sustainability is fundamental to our business
philosophy  from product development and manufacturing to how customers use our
products.
For more than 40 years, 3M has been a
leader among global corporations in sustainability actions and measures,
beginning with the creation of its groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays (3P)
Program in 1975 to a broad portfolio of sustainable products today. As a global
corporation, we believe that we have a significant responsibility to society in
general, and especially to the communities in which we live and work. Fulfilling
our responsibility is important both from an environmental stewardship
perspective and as a key competitive strategy. Our corporate vision states: 3M
technology advancing every company... 3M products enhancing every home... and 3M
innovation improving every life. It is that vision  that focuses on our
customers needs and well-being  that guides our sustainability strategies and
goals, and the respect we demonstrate for our social and physical
environments.
We have created hundreds of sustainable
solutions and product platforms to help our customers manage their environmental
footprint  from paint systems that reduce the need for cleaning solvents and
window films that ease energy consumption to a greener tape that is made with
plant-based adhesive and film.
In January 2013, our CEO formed the
Sustainability Center of Excellence to focus on developing and commercializing
products which help our customers solve their sustainability challenges and on
ensuring sustainability within 3M operations and supply chain. The Vice
President of Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability reports to the
Senior Vice President of 3M Supply Chain, who reports to the CEO. The formation
of the Sustainability Center of Excellence demonstrates the Companys commitment
to integrate innovation and sustainability into our products and operations for
the benefit of our customers and our communities. The primary role of the Center
is to develop strategy, set significant goals to track progress, and drive
sustainable actions throughout 3M. Sustainability will continue to be a vital
focus as we work to truly advance every company, enhance every home, and improve
every life.
As part of our sustainability efforts,
we are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights  a
policy initiative for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ten
principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and
anti-corruption. We

RELATED PERSON
TRANSACTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES
The Board of Directors has adopted a
written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures which is administered
by the Nominating and Governance Committee. This Policy applies to any
transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a
participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that
term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material interest and
which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Transactions that fall within this definition are referred to the Committee for
approval, ratification, or other action. Based on its consideration of all of
the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to
approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are in the best
interests of the Company. In the course of its review and approval or
ratification of a transaction, the Committee considers:


●

the nature of the Related
      Persons interest in the transaction;

●

the material terms of the
      transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less
      favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party
      under the same or similar circumstances;

●

the significance of the
      transaction to the Related Person;

●

the significance of the
      transaction to the Company;

●

whether the transaction would
      impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best
      interest of the Company; and

●

any other matters the Committee
      deems appropriate.
Any Committee member who is a Related
Person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the
deliberations or vote respecting such approval or ratification, except that such
a director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
at which the Committee considers the transaction.
POLICY ON ADOPTION
OF A RIGHTS PLAN
In 2002 and 2003, a 3M stockholder
submitted a stockholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for
adopting a stockholders rights plan (also known as a poison pill). 3M does
not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board
continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which
adoption of a rights plan would give the Board the negotiating power and
leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M stockholders in the context
of a takeover effort.
Following consideration of the
favorable vote the stockholder proposal received and in light of this belief,
the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The
Boards policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either (1)
stockholders have approved adoption of the rights plan or (2) the Board
(including a majority of the independent members of the Board), in its exercise
of its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that, under the
circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of 3Ms
stockholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting from
seeking stockholder approval.
The Board has directed the Nominating
and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and
to report to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy.
The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3Ms published Corporate
Governance Guidelines and its Proxy Statement.


BOARD STRUCTURE AND
      PROCESSES
BOARDS LEADERSHIP
STRUCTURE
The Boards leadership structure is
characterized by:


●

a combined Chairman of the Board
      and CEO;

●

a strong, independent, and highly
      experienced Lead Director with well-defined responsibilities that support
      the Boards oversight responsibilities;

●

a robust committee structure
      consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight of various
      types of risks; and

●

an engaged and independent
      Board.
The Board of Directors believes that
this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement
while deriving the benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the
Board. As the individual with primary
responsibility for managing the Companys day-to-day operations and with
in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, our CEO is best positioned
to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and
strategic issues. Coupled with an independent Lead Director, this combined
structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion
regarding the Boards oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management
of business operations.
The Board believes that adopting a
rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the
Board and CEO would inhibit the Boards ability to provide for a leadership
structure that would best
22  |  3M



Table of Contents
serve stockholders. As a result, the
Board has rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the
positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are
reviewed at least annually and available on our Web site at www.3M.com,
under Investor Relations  Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach
that allows it, in representing the stockholders best interests, to decide who
should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or anticipated future
circumstances.
The Board believes that combining the
roles of CEO and Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective Board. The
Board believes that to drive change and continuous improvement within the
Company, tempered by respect for 3Ms traditions and values, the CEO must have
maximum authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading
significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving growth, managing
the Companys day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the
Company, and reinforcing the expectation for all employees of continuing to
build on 3Ms century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing
business the right way.
The Board believes that the Companys
corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue
to effectively oversee the Companys management and key issues related to
executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk,
and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part,
that:


●
Independent
      directors comprise a substantial majority of the Board;

●
Directors are elected annually
      by a majority vote in uncontested director elections;

●
Only independent directors
      serve on the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance
      Committees;

●
The committee chairs establish
      their respective agendas;

●
The Board and committees may
      retain their own advisors;

●
The independent directors have
      complete access to management and employees;

●
The independent directors meet
      in executive session without the CEO or other employees during each
      regular Board meeting; and

●
The Board and each committee
      regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its
      committees function effectively.
The Board has also designated one of
its members to serve as Lead Director, with responsibilities (described in the
next section) that are similar to those typically performed by an independent
chairman.
INDEPENDENT LEAD
DIRECTOR
The Board has designated one of its
members to serve as a Lead Director, with responsibilities that are similar to
those typically performed by an independent chairman (Lead Director). Michael
L. Eskew was appointed Lead Director by the independent directors effective
November 12, 2012, succeeding Dr. Vance Coffman who had served as Lead Director
since 2006. Michael Eskew is a highly experienced director, currently serving on
the boards of The Allstate Corporation, International Business Machines
Corporation, and Eli Lilly and Company, and was the former Chairman and CEO of
United Parcel Service, Inc. His responsibilities include, but are not limited
to, the following:



●
Presides at
      all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including
      executive sessions of the independent directors;

●
Acts as a key liaison between
      the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;

●
Approves the meeting agendas
      for the Board, and approves the meeting schedules to assure that there is
      sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;

●
Has the authority to approve
      the materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board
      meeting and provides feedback regarding the quality, quantity, and
      timeliness of those materials (this duty not only gives the Lead Director
      approval authority with respect to materials to be delivered to the
      directors in advance of each Board meeting but also provides a feedback
      mechanism so that the materials may be improved for future
      meetings);

●
Has the authority to call
      meetings of the independent directors;

●
Communicates Board member
      feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the Compensation Committee leads the discussion of the
      Chairman/CEOs performance and communicates the Boards evaluation of that
      performance to the Chairman/CEO);

●
If requested by major
      stockholders, ensures that he is available, when appropriate, for
      consultation and direct communication; and

●
Performs such other duties as
      requested by the independent directors.
EXECUTIVE
SESSIONS
As an agenda item for every regularly
scheduled Board and committee meeting, independent directors regularly meet in
executive session, without the Chairman/CEO or other members of management
present, to consider such matters as they deem appropriate.

BOARD
  COMMITTEES
BOARD AND COMMITTEE
EVALUATIONS
The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its
committees are functioning effectively and consider opportunities for continual
enhancement. The Nominating and Governance Committee solicits and receives
comments from all directors and shares those comments with the Board. Based on
the comments and further discussion and reflection, the Board makes an
assessment reviewing areas in which the Board believes improvements could be
made to increase the effectiveness of the Board and its committees as well as
identifying existing practices which have contributed to high effectiveness and
accordingly should be continued. Self-evaluation items requiring follow-up
and/or the development and execution of implementation and action plans are
monitored on a going-forward basis by the full Board, as well as by individual
committees and the chairs thereof, as applicable. While this formal
self-evaluation is conducted on an annual basis, directors share perspectives,
feedback, and suggestions year-round. The Board and each committee conducted an
evaluation of its performance in 2015.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE
INFORMATION
The Board currently has thirteen
directors and the following four committees: Audit, Compensation, Finance, and
Nominating and Governance. On August 10, 2015, the Board of Directors elected
David B. Dillon as a director and appointed him as a member of the Audit and
Nominating and Governance Committees. In February 2016, the Board elected
Gregory R. Page and Patricia A. Woertz as directors. Gregory R. Page joined the
Audit and Nominating and Governance Committees, and Patricia A. Woertz joined
the Compensation and Finance Committees. Linda Alvarado is not seeking
re-election and will end her service on the 3M Board on May 10, 2016, when her
term expires. The membership and the function of each committee are described
below.
During 2015, the Board of Directors
held six regularly scheduled meetings and two telephonic meetings. Overall
attendance at Board and committee meetings was 97 percent.
The Company has a long-standing policy
that directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless
extenuating circumstances prevent them from attending. All directors who were
members of the Board as of May 2015 attended last years Annual Meeting of
Stockholders.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND STOCK
      OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
The Nominating and Governance Committee
periodically receives reports on the status of Board compensation in relation to
other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending to the Board
changes in compensation for non-employee directors. In developing its
recommendations, the Committee is guided by the following goals:



●
Compensation should fairly pay
      directors for work required in a company of 3Ms size and
  scope;

●
A significant portion of the
      total compensation should be paid in common stock to align directors
      interests with the long-term interests of stockholders; and

●

The structure of the compensation should be simple and
      transparent.
Periodically, at the request of the
Committee, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. conducts a survey of director
compensation at other large U.S. companies and provides expert advisory support
to the Committee on the compensation of non-employee directors. Neither the
Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has any arrangement with any
other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the
amount or form of director compensation. Non-employee directors compensation
includes the following compensation elements:
Annual
Compensation  In May 2015, the Nominating and Governance Committee
considered a board compensation study prepared by Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. After reviewing that study, the Committee
recommended and the Board approved an increase of $10,000 in the annual
compensation for non-employee directors from $270,000 to $280,000, effective
January 1, 2015. All of the $10,000 increase was allocated to an increase in the
annual stock retainer (from $150,000 to $160,000). The annual cash retainer of
$120,000 remains unchanged. Approximately 43 percent of the annual compensation
(or $120,000) is payable in cash in four quarterly installments and
approximately 57 percent of the annual compensation (or $160,000) is payable in
common stock after the Annual Meeting. In addition, the chair of the Audit
Committee receives an additional annual fee of $25,000 and the chair of the
Compensation Committee receives an additional annual fee of $20,000. The chairs
of the Finance and Nominating and Governance
Committees each receive an additional annual fee of $15,000. The Lead Director
receives an additional annual fee of $30,000. There are no meeting fees. In lieu
of the cash fees, a director may elect to receive common stock of the Company.
Non-employee directors may also voluntarily defer all or part of their annual
cash fees or stock awards until they cease to be members of the
Board.
Deferred
Stock  For directors who have elected
to defer their annual stock awards or annual cash fees into a common stock
equivalents account (Deferred Stock), the Company credits their accounts with
a number of 3M common stock equivalents (including fractional share equivalents)
equal to the number of actual shares of 3M common stock which could have been
purchased with such deferred amounts on the first day of the calendar quarter,
using the closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on the last business day
immediately preceding such date. In addition, on each payment date for dividends
on 3M common stock, the Company credits to the directors accounts a number of
3M common stock equivalents having a value equal to the dividend, determined by
using the closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on the sixth business day
preceding the dividend record date. The Deferred Stock is fully vested upon
grant but does not have voting rights. Appropriate adjustments to the amount of
Deferred Stock shall be made to the accounts for stock splits, stock dividends,
merger, consolidation, payment of dividends other than in cash, and similar
circumstances affecting 3M common stock. The Deferred Stock will be distributed
in 3M common stock to non-employee directors beginning on January 1 of the year
following the year in which they leave the Board, either in a lump sum or in up
to ten annual installments pursuant to their deferral elections.
All Other
Compensation  The column below showing All Other Compensation includes
the incremental cost of complimentary products and matching gifts. The
non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Companys matching
gift program on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M
Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year in contributions by the
director to eligible institutions of higher education.

AUDIT
COMMITTEEMATTERS
PROPOSAL NO. 2: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OFINDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2016
The Audit Committee is directly
responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of all fees),
retention, and oversight of the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm (Independent Accounting Firm) retained to perform the audit of
our financial statements and our internal control over financial
reporting.
The Audit Committee has appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to serve as 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm
for 2016. PwC has been 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to
that, 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand (until its
merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998). In accordance with SEC rules and PwC
policy, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number
of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company.
For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years
of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the
Companys lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting
between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well
as discussion by the full Committee and with management. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews
PwCs independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committees
determination of whether to retain PwC or engage another firm as our Independent
Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers,
among other things:


●

PwCs historical and recent
      performance on the 3M audit, including the results of a survey of those 3M
      employees with substantial contact with PwC throughout the year. The
      survey seeks input about PwCs quality of service provided, and the
      independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated
      throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit team;

●

an analysis of PwCs known legal
      risks and significant proceedings;

●

external data relating to audit
      quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (PCAOB) reports on PwC and its peer
  firms;


●

PwCs
  independence;

●

the appropriateness of PwCs
      fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its peer
      firms;

●

PwCs tenure as our independent
      auditor and its familiarity with our global operations and businesses,
      accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial
      reporting; and

●

PwCs capability and expertise in
      handling the breadth and complexity of our global operations, including
      the Companys phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning
      system on a worldwide basis over the next several
  years.
Based on this evaluation, the Audit
Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests
of the Company and our stockholders to retain PwC to serve as our Independent
Accounting Firm for 2016.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection
of PwC as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2016. Although ratification is not
required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of
PwC to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate
governance. If the selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will
consider whether it is appropriate to select another Independent Accounting
Firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its
discretion select a different Independent Accounting Firm at any time during the
year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the
Company and our stockholders.
PwC representatives are expected to
attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to questions
and, if they desire, to make a statement.


RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT
COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the
appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm for 2016. Proxies solicited by the Board of
Directors will be voted FOR ratification unless a stockholder indicates
otherwise in voting the proxy.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee oversees the
Companys financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The
management of the Company is responsible for (i) the preparation of complete and
accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements (financial
statements) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting
principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with
accounting standards and laws and regulations, and (iii) an assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent
Accounting Firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) an
audit of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and a review of
the Companys quarterly financial statements and expressing opinions on the
Companys financial statements and internal control over financial reporting
based on the integrated audits. 
In this context, the Audit Committee
has met and held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm
regarding the fair and complete presentation of the Companys results and the
assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Audit
Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company
in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has
represented to the Audit Committee that the Companys consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and
discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the
Independent Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the
PCAOBs Auditing Standards on Communications with Audit Committees, as currently
in effect.
In addition, the Audit Committee has
reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditors
independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the
Audit Committee has received the written
disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB
regarding the Independent Accounting Firms communications with the Audit
Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the
Independent Accounting Firms independence from the Company.
The Audit Committee also has considered
whether the Independent Accounting Firms provision of non-audit services to the
Company is compatible with the auditors independence. The Audit Committee has
concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company
and its management.
The Audit Committee has discussed with
the Companys Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the
overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee
meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel,
and representatives of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive
sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the
Companys internal controls, and the overall quality of the Companys financial
reporting and compliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and
discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board
of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements
be included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, for filing with the SEC.

AUDIT COMMITTEE POLICY ON
      PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDITSERVICES OF THE
      INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee is responsible for
appointing and overseeing the work of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit
Committee has established the following procedures for the pre-approval of all
audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting
Firm. 
Before engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm for the next years audit, the Independent Accounting Firm will
submit to the Audit Committee for approval a detailed description of services it
expects to render to the Company during that year for each of the following
categories of services: 


●
Audit services include
      audit work performed in the preparation of consolidated financial
      statements, as well as work that generally only the Independent Accounting
      Firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters,
      statutory audits, attest services, and consultation regarding financial
      accounting and/or reporting standards; 

●
Audit-related services
      are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by
      the Independent Accounting Firm, including due diligence related to
      mergers and acquisitions or dispositions, employee benefit plan audits,
      and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory
      requirements;

●
Tax services include
      all services performed by the Independent Accounting Firms tax personnel
      except those services specifically related to the audit of the financial
      statements, and include fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax planning,
      and tax advice; and 

●
Other services are
      those services not captured in the other
categories.
Before engagement, the Audit Committee
pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and
the Audit Committee requires the Independent Accounting Firm to report actual
fees in comparison to the budget periodically throughout the year by category of
service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary
to engage the Independent Accounting Firm for additional services not
contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit
Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the Independent
Accounting Firm.
The Audit Committee has delegated
pre-approval authority to the chair of the Committee. The chair must report, for
informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee
at its next scheduled meeting.

      FIRM
The following table represents fees for
professional financial statements for the years ended December 31, services
rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 2014 and 2015, and fees billed for other
services rendered (PwC) for the audit of the Companys consolidated by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during those periods.

AUDIT COMMITTEE RESTRICTIONS ON HIRING
EMPLOYEES OF THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has adopted
restrictions on the hiring by the Company of any PwC partner, director, manager,
staff, reviewing actuary, reviewing tax professional, and any other persons
having responsibility for providing audit assurance on any aspect of PwCs
 certification of the Companys
financial statements. Audit assurance includes all work that results in the
expression of an opinion on financial statements, including audits of statutory
accounts.

EXECUTIVECOMPENSATION
PROPOSAL NO. 3: ADVISORY APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange
Act provides our stockholders with the opportunity to approve, on an advisory
basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this
Proxy Statement. This is the sixth year that the Company is asking stockholders
to vote on this type of proposal, known as a say-on-pay proposal. As required
by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, the Company anticipates providing
its stockholders with the opportunity at its 2017 Annual Meeting to cast an
advisory vote on the frequency with which stockholders will be offered the
chance to vote on future say-on-pay proposals.
We believe that our executive
compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is
structured to assure that those principles are implemented. At the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders held on May 12, 2015, approximately 96 percent of the
votes cast on this issue voted to approve the compensation of the Companys
named executive officers as disclosed in last years Proxy Statement. Although
the vote was non-binding, the Committee believes this level of approval
percentage indicates that our stockholders strongly support our core
compensation principles and our executive compensation program, and we believe
our stockholders as a whole should support them as well. 
Thus, the Company is submitting to
stockholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders
approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Companys Named Executive
Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation
disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the
accompanying compensation tables and related narrative). 
As described in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M delivered another
year of strong financial performance in 2015. These results reflected the strong
performance of the Companys leadership team, including the Named Executive
Officers, which impacted their annual and long-term incentive compensation
earned during 2015. The Compensation Committee has taken additional actions in
2015 to further strengthen the alignment between the incentive compensation of
3Ms executives and both the financial performance of the Company and its
business units as well as their individual performance. 
While the Board of Directors and the
Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on
this proposal when making future decisions regarding executive compensation, the
vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in
nature.


RECOMMENDATION OF THE
BOARD
The Board of Directors unanimously
recommends a vote FOR this proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies
solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted FOR this proposal unless a
stockholder indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.

prepare and position our Company for long-term success. Other noteworthy
accomplishments include the following:

      science to improve lives; and

●

Completed a corporate
      restructuring to improve efficiency and further strengthen our
      competitiveness.
FACTORS CREATING
ALIGNMENT BETWEEN PAY AND PERFORMANCE
3Ms executive compensation program is
designed to maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and
executive compensation by tying incentive compensation to the achievement of
performance metrics that we believe increase the Companys long-term value.
Highlights of the program include:


●
A large portion of each
      executives Total Direct Compensation (cash
      plus long-term incentives) is
      performance-based, varying from 90 percent for Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin to a range of 83-85 percent for the other Named Executive
Officers; and


●

The incentive compensation
      opportunities provided to the Companys executives are based on multiple
      performance-based metrics focused primarily on growth in revenue and
      earnings, increase in 3Ms stock price, efficient use of capital and free
      cash flow conversion.
IMPACT OF COMPANY
PERFORMANCE ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
The Companys performance directly
impacted incentive compensation decisions and pay outcomes for our Named
Executive Officers as follows:
2015 Annual
Incentive Compensation
For the Named Executive Officers paid
on the basis of the Companys overall performance, the 2015 annual incentive
compensation payout (before any adjustment for individual performance) averaged
95 percent of the target amount. The payouts reflect our solid performance
against the goals established for 2015:


●
Local currency sales achieved
      97 percent of plan;

●
3M economic profit achieved 94
      percent of plan; and

●
3Ms 2015 economic profit
      represents 106 percent of its 2014
      results

Performance Share Awards
(Long-Term Incentive Compensation)
The number of shares delivered pursuant
to the performance share awards issued to the Named Executive Officers for the
2013-2015 performance period equaled 116 percent of the target number of shares
awarded. The actual number of shares issued exceeded the target number of
performance shares awarded due to solid performance against the performance
goals established for these awards in February 2013, as shown below.

Table of Contents
After considering the appreciation in
3Ms stock price over the three-year performance period, the value of the 3M
shares delivered to the Companys executives in settlement of these awards
(determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE
for December 31, 2015) equaled 182 percent of the value of the target number of
performance shares subject to such awards (determined using the closing price of
a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for March 1, 2013, the initial grant date
of 2013 performance share awards).
Stock and Stock
Options (Long-Term Incentive Compensation)
The performance of 3Ms stock has a
material impact on the amount of compensation actually realized by our Named
Executive Officers. Our stock ownership guidelines require covered executives, including the Named Executive
Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a value exceeding a specified
multiple of their base salary. If the market price of 3Ms stock declines, so
does the value of the long-term incentive compensation provided to our Named
Executive Officers.
Similarly, stock options held by our Named Executive
Officers increase or decrease in value along with increases and decreases in
value of 3Ms common stock. The stock options granted to 3Ms executives during
and in years prior to 2015 declined in value as the Companys stock price
decreased from $164.32 on December 31, 2014, to $150.64 on December 31,
2015.
TOTAL STOCKHOLDER
RETURN
As reflected in the following table,
3Ms stock performance (total stockholder return of 20 percent over the
three-year period ending on December 31, 2015) continues to compare favorably
with the stock performance of the peer companies included in the Companys
executive peer group (for which the median total stockholder return over the
same three-year period was 17 percent).

cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive
officers as disclosed in last years Proxy Statement. Although the vote was
non-binding, the Committee believes this level of approval indicates that
stockholders strongly support our executive compensation programs and policies.
The Committee will consider the results of this years say-on-pay proposal, as
well as feedback from our stockholders, when making future executive
compensation decisions.
For information concerning our investor
outreach efforts, please refer to the section entitled Stockholder Outreach and
Engagement on page 18 of this Proxy Statement.
SIGNIFICANT
COMPENSATION ACTIONS DURING 2015
During 2015, 3M and the Committee took
the following actions with respect to the Companys executive compensation
program:


●
Amended the Annual Incentive
      Plan (effective for 2015) to reduce the
      maximum payout from 300 percent to 200
      percent of the participantss target amount;

●
Revised the weighting of the
      three performance metrics used in the
      Annual Incentive Plan (effective for 2015)
      to increase alignment to overall corporate results and initiatives. The new weightings are as follows: Local Currency Sales vs Plan (50
      percent), Economic Profit vs. Plan (20
      percent), and 3M Economic Profit vs.
      Prior Year (30 percent);

●
Revised the performance
      criteria for new performance share awards
      (effective for 2015 performance share
      awards) to better align this portion of our
      executives long-term incentive compensation with the long-term financial objectives previously announced by the Company. In particular, the 2015 performance share awards
utilize two new performance criteria (earnings
      per share growth and free cash flow
      conversion) that replace the New Product
      Vitality Index. With this change, all four
      performance criteria used for the 2015
      performance share awards are now aligned with the Companys publicly-stated long-term financial objectives;


●
Effective with performance
      share awards made in 2015, began adjusting
      the initial grant value of each executives
      performance share award to reflect their individual performance during the preceding year. In the past, individual performance affected only
target annual incentive compensation and the
      annual stock option grant. This change was
      made to better recognize and encourage
      exceptional individual performance;
      and

●
Amended the definition of
      Retirement in our Annual Incentive Plan
      and our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan
      effective as of January 1, 2016, to mean a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of
      service. Prior to this change, the term
      Retirement meant a termination of
      employment with the Company after attaining
      age 55 with at least five years of service. This change was made to encourage longer service to the Company. The previous definition continues
      to apply to awards granted under our 2008
      Long-Term Incentive Plan before January 1,
      2016.

SECTION II: HOW WE DETERMINE
      COMPENSATION
PRINCIPLES OF 3MS
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
3M believes that the compensation of
its executives should be closely tied to the performance of the Company, so that
their interests are aligned with the interests of long-term 3M stockholders.
Consistent with this philosophy, the following core principles provide a
framework for the Companys executive compensation program:


●
Total Direct Compensation
      should be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their
      highest levels, reward individual
contributions that improve the Companys
      ability to deliver outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the
      leadership abilities and skills
necessary for building long-term
      stockholder value;


●
The portion of Total Direct
      Compensation that is performance-based and is, therefore, at risk should increase with the
      level of an individuals responsibility; 

●
The program should balance
      incentives for delivering outstanding long-term, sustainable
      performance against the potential risk of encouraging inappropriate risk-taking;



●
The metrics and targets for
      earning performance-based incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to,
      increasing stockholder value over the long term; and

●
Executives are most
      effectively motivated to build long-term stockholder value when a
      significant portion of their personal net worth is tied to the value of 3M
      stock.
ROLE OF THE
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND ITS INDEPENDENT ADVISOR
3M provides compensation to its
executives to recognize their contributions to the success of its business and
reward them for delivering performance that meets the growth, profitability, and
other objectives of the Company. All elements of this compensation are
determined by the Committee, which is composed solely of independent
non-employee directors. In addition, the Committees decisions concerning the
compensation of 3Ms Chief Executive Officer are subject to ratification by all
of the independent members of the Board of Directors.
The Committee regularly reviews the
design of and risks associated with the Companys executive compensation
program.
During 2015, the Committee was assisted
in its review by its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. In addition to participating in the
meetings of the Committee, Mr. Paulin provides the Committee with advice
regarding the Companys executive salary structure, annual and long-term
incentive compensation plans, compensation-related risks, and other executive
pay policies. He also provides expert knowledge of marketplace trends and best
practices relating to executive compensation practices and competitive pay
levels. Mr. Paulin and his firm provide no other services to the Company or 3M
management, with the exception of independent advisory support to the Nominating
and Governance Committee on the compensation of 3Ms non-employee directors so
that valuation methodologies and peer groups are consistent with those used for
executives and other employees. During the year, the Committee conducted an
evaluation of the independence of Mr. Paulin and his firm considering the
relevant regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the listing
standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Committee concluded that the
services performed by Mr. Paulin and his firm raised no conflicts of
interest.
The Committee also reviews and approves
annual performance goals and objectives for 3Ms Chief Executive Officer. Acting
through its Chairman, the Committee also conducts and discusses with the
independent members of the Board of Directors an annual evaluation of the Chief
Executive Officers performance against such goals and objectives. Finally, the
Committee, assisted by its independent compensation consultant, reviews and
approves (based on this annual evaluation) the compensation of the Chief
Executive Officer (subject to ratification by the independent members of the
Board of Directors) at least annually.
ROLE OF
MANAGEMENT
3Ms Chief Executive Officer and Senior
Vice President, Human Resources, assist the Committee with the process of
determining the compensation of the Companys executives. In particular, Mr.
Thulin, assisted by 3Ms Senior Vice President, Human Resources, performs an
annual performance evaluation of each of 3Ms senior executives whose
compensation is determined by the Committee. The results of these annual
performance evaluations form the basis for Mr. Thulins recommendations to the
Committee as to the annual merit base salary and target annual incentive
compensation increases for such senior executives, as well as the amount of
their annual long-term incentive compensation awards. The Committee discusses
these recommendations with Mr. Thulin at its meetings prior to making its
decisions on any change to an executives annual base salary, annual incentive
compensation, or any long-term incentive compensation awards.

ELEMENTS OF THE
COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The compensation program for 3Ms
executives consists of the following elements:


●
base salary;

●
short-term cash incentive in
      the form of an annual performance-based award opportunity; and

●
long-term equity incentives in
      the form of annual awards of performance shares and stock options, and in certain
      circumstances (for purposes of hiring or retaining key
      talent, for example), grants of restricted stock
      units.
3Ms executives also participate in
various benefit plans made available to most of 3Ms U.S. employees. They are
also eligible to participate in three deferred compensation plans (which enable
them to save for retirement or other financial planning purposes) and receive
certain other benefits. These additional benefits are described in the All Other
Compensation Table. The entire program applied to approximately 100 members of
senior management during 2015, including all of the Named Executive
Officers.
The illustration below and the table
that follows show how the 2015 Total Direct Compensation of the Named Executive Officers
was apportioned among these elements and how these elements relate to the
strategic business goals of the Company.

3M pays each of its executives a
      base salary in cash on a monthly basis. The amount of this base salary is
      reviewed at least annually, and does not vary with the performance of the
      Company. Base salaries are designed to compensate the executives for their
      normal day-to-day responsibilities, and it is the only component of their
      compensation that is considered to be fixed rather than variable in
      nature.

3M provides its executives with
      annual incentive compensation through plans that are designed to align a
      significant portion of their Total Cash Compensation with the financial
      performance of the Company and its business units. Each executive is
      assigned a target amount of annual incentive compensation as part of his
      or her Total Cash Compensation, but the amount of annual incentive
      compensation actually paid depends on the performance of 3M and its
      relevant business units as well as the executives individual
      performance.

DESIGN
      AND RATIONALE FOR COMPENSATION ELEMENT


Annual
      Incentive (continued)


3Ms AIP offers eligible
      employees an opportunity to earn short-term incentive compensation based
      on three performance metrics, which were weighted as indicated for
      2015:
●Local Currency Sales (of 3M or a business unit, as
      applicable) vs. plan for the current year
      (50 percent);
●Economic Profit (of 3M or a business unit, as
      applicable) vs. plan for the current year
      (20 percent); and
●3M Economic Profit vs. actual results for the prior year
      (30 percent).
The amount paid to an eligible
      employee for a particular year may range from 0 percent to 200 percent of
      the employees target amount for that year. The amount of annual incentive
      compensation actually paid to an eligible employee may be increased by up
      to 30 percent or be reduced by up to 100 percent based on the employees
      individual performance during that year. Individual performance takes into
      account both quantitative (financial results, for example) and qualitative
      (market and economic circumstances, for example) factors. In no event,
      however, may the total amount paid to an eligible employee exceed 200
      percent of the employees target amount for the year.
In determining the amount of
      annual incentive compensation paid to a Named Executive Officer, the Named
      Executive Officers individual performance is considered based upon the
      annual performance evaluation that Mr. Thulin, assisted by 3Ms Senior
      Vice President, Human Resources, does for each Named Executive Officer
      (other than himself) and the annual performance evaluation that the
      Compensation Committee (acting through its Chairman) does for Mr. Thulin.
      These performance evaluations are done according to 3Ms overall
      performance assessment and management processes, which involve setting
      annual financial and non-financial goals and objectives for each
      individual and then assessing the individuals overall performance against
      these goals and objectives at the end of the year. While the annual
      incentive compensation earned by most 3M executives is determined under
      the AIP, the annual incentive compensation earned by 3Ms Named Executive
      Officers, as well as the other senior executives whose compensation is
      decided by the Committee, is determined under the Executive Plan approved
      by 3Ms stockholders at the 2007 Annual Meeting. A total of
      18 senior executives participated in this Executive Plan during 2015.
      This Executive Plan, which is intended to provide compensation that is
      exempt from the $1 million annual deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the
      Internal Revenue Code, provides performance-based compensation for which
      the performance goal is the Companys Adjusted Net Income.
Assuming the Company meets the
      Adjusted Net Income goal, the Executive Plan provides the Committee with
      discretion to determine the amount of annual incentive compensation paid
      to 3Ms Named Executive Officers and its other senior executives. The
      Executive Plan establishes a maximum amount of annual incentive
      compensation that may be earned by each covered executive for a year (a
      percentage of the Companys Adjusted Net Income for such year) and then
      the Committee utilizes this discretion to pay each covered executive less
      than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since
      the Executive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Committee has rarely
      used this discretion to pay a covered executive (other than our Chief
      Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive
      would have received had he or she been participating in the broad-based
      AIP (including the individual performance
  multiplier).

3M provides long-term incentive
      compensation to its executives through the Long-Term Incentive Plan
      approved by 3Ms stockholders at the 2008 Annual Meeting. This is a
      typical omnibus-type plan that authorizes the Committee to grant stock
      options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation
      rights, performance shares, and other stock awards to management employees
      of the Company. The Company provides its executives with this long-term
      incentive compensation based on 3M common stock in order to effectively
      motivate such executives to build long-term stockholder value.
In determining the initial grant value of the long-term incentive compensation
      provided to our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee
      considers the individual performance of our Named Executive Officers using
      the performance evaluations described under Annual Incentive
      above.


Benefits and Perquisites



3Ms executives participate in
      the same health care, disability, life insurance, pension, and 401(k)
      benefit plans available to most of the Companys U.S.
employees.
Executives also receive a limited
      number of additional benefits and perquisites described in more detail in
      the All Other Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement. These additional
      benefits and perquisites are provided for the convenience (financial
      planning assistance, for example), financial security (retirement
      contributions and premiums for additional life insurance coverage, for
      example), or personal security (travel on corporate aircraft and home
      security equipment/monitoring, for example) of the executives. No tax
      gross-ups are provided on any of these additional benefits and
      perquisites.
BENCHMARKING
3M competes for executive talent in a
global market. In order to ensure that we are providing Total Direct
Compensation that is competitive, the Committee annually conducts a rigorous
benchmarking process with the help of its independent compensation consultant,
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. During this process, the Committee considers
available pay data for two peer groups: an executive peer group and a survey
peer group.
Executive Peer
Group
For 2015, the executive peer group
consisted of the 19 companies identified below (which remained the same as in
the previous year), as recommended by the Committees independent compensation
consultant and approved by the Committee. The companies in this executive peer
group were selected because (1) their performance was monitored regularly by the same
market analysts who monitor the performance of 3M (investment peers), and/ or
(2) they met criteria based on similarity of their business and pay models,
market capitalization (based on an eight-quarter rolling average), and annual
revenues.

The Company receives pay data and
information on the executive compensation practices at the companies in 3Ms
executive peer group from Aon Hewitt and Frederic W. Cook & Co.,
Inc.
Survey Peer
Group
There are approximately 170 comparator
companies in the survey peer group, although the number and identity of the
companies varies from year to year and from survey to survey. The survey peer
group consists of companies in the Standard & Poors 500 Index and/or other
companies with annual revenue exceeding $20 billion that participate in one or
more executive compensation surveys obtained from
three consulting firms (Aon Hewitt, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., and Willis
Towers Watson). Pay data for the survey peer group is statistically regressed to
recognize the different sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual
revenues) as compared to the size of 3M. The Committee does not review the
identity of the companies in this survey comparator group.
HOW THE COMMITTEE
USES BENCHMARKING INFORMATION
The Committee considers the pay data
from the executive peer group when determining each executives Total Direct
Compensation. For executives whose performance meets the Companys expectations,
the Committee aims to provide them with target Total Cash Compensation that is
at or very close to the median of the corresponding target compensation paid to
executives in the executive peer group, and with long-term incentive
compensation delivered through annual grants having initial target
values
44  |  3M


Table of
Contents
that are within a range of 80 to 120
percent of the median of the corresponding compensation values provided to
executives in the executive peer group. Executives whose performance
consistently exceeds the Companys expectations may receive Total Cash
Compensation of 120 to 125 percent of the median of the corresponding
compensation paid to executives in the executive peer group. Executives whose
performance far exceeds the Companys expectations may also receive annual
long-term incentive compensation grants having values that are within a range of
125 to 160 percent of the median of the corresponding compensation values
provided to executives in the executive peer group. The pay data for the survey
peer group is used by the Committee to assess the reasonableness of the
benchmarking results for each executive position benchmarked, helping to ensure
that the Companys compensation objectives are being met.
The Committee also
uses information on the executive compensation practices at companies in the
executive peer group when considering design changes to the Companys executive
compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this information
from the Benchmarking Groups enables the Committee to create better alignment
between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can attract and
retain high-performing executive leaders.
TAX
CONSIDERATIONS
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code prohibits 3M from deducting compensation in excess of $1 million paid in
any year to any Covered Employee, but this limit does not apply to
performance-based compensation that meets certain requirements under Section
162(m). For this purpose, the term Covered Employee means our Chief Executive
Officer and each other Named Executive Officer whose compensation is reported in
the Summary Compensation Table for the preceding year by reason of being among
the three most highly compensated officers for that year, but does not include
the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee continues to emphasize
performance-based compensation for executives. However, the Committee believes
that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that
attracts, retains, and rewards the executive talent necessary for the Companys
success. Consequently, in any year, the Committee may authorize compensation in
excess of $1 million that is not considered performance-based compensation for
purposes of Section 162(m). The Committee recognizes that the loss of the tax
deduction may be unavoidable under these circumstances.
SAY-ON-PAY ADVISORY
APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
At our 2015 Annual Meeting, we
conducted an advisory vote of stockholders with respect to the compensation of
our named executive officers. Approximately 96 percent of votes cast on this
item approved the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in
the 2015 Proxy Statement. While the approval was advisory in nature, the
Committee believes the outcome of this vote serves as confirmation that an
overwhelming majority of our stockholders believe that the pay of the Named
Executive Officers is appropriately aligned with the performance of the Company
as well as the interests of 3Ms stockholders. As a result, the Committee chose
not to make any changes in our executive compensation programs or policies or
the compensation of any Named Executive Officer based on the favorable outcome
of this vote.
MEANING OF CERTAIN
TERMS
This Compensation Discussion and
Analysis uses the following terms when discussing executive compensation of the
Company:


ADJUSTED NET INCOME
     

means the net income of 3M as
      reported in its Consolidated Statement of Income, as adjusted to exclude
      special items.

AIP


means the broad-based Annual
      Incentive Plan by which the Company provides annual incentive compensation
      to approximately 30,000 eligible employees.

BENCHMARKING GROUPS
 

means both 3Ms executive peer
      group of 19 companies, as described in the Benchmarking section of this
      Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the survey comparator
      group.

COMMITTEE


means the Compensation Committee
      of the Board of Directors of 3M Company.

      divestiture is included in the operating plan for the business unit), less
      a charge (10 percent in 2015) for the capital used to generate such
      operating income. 3M Economic Profit is calculated using total Company
      capital (total assets, minus total liabilities other than debt, as
      reported in its Consolidated Balance Sheet), while the Economic Profit of
      a business unit is calculated using only accounts receivable and
      inventories of such business unit as
capital.

SECTION III: HOW WE PAID OUR NAMED
      EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2015 
All amounts were determined by the
Committee, assisted by its independent compensation consultant, with the input
of Mr. Thulin (other than with respect to his own compensation) and our Senior
Vice President, Human Resources. This input included: 


●
Mr. Thulins recommendations
      based on his assessment of the performance of the other Named Executive
      Officers after receiving input and assistance from our Senior Vice
      President, Human Resources; 

●
The compensation information
      from the companies in the Benchmarking Groups; and 

●
A report comparing the amounts of
      compensation actually received by the Companys Named Executive Officers
      to the amounts reported in its annual proxy statement and summarizing the
      compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the event of the
      termination of their employment under various circumstances. This report
      helps the Committee better understand the Companys potential obligations
      to the Named Executive Officers following the termination of their
      employment, as well as assessing the risk of any individual leaving the
      Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient
      retention incentives.
Differences in the amounts of
compensation provided to 3Ms Named Executive Officers reflect a variety of
factors, including job responsibilities, the market pay for executives
performing similar responsibilities (as measured by the pay information obtained
from companies in the Benchmarking Groups), experience and time in their current
positions, internal pay equity, and individual performance. Overall, the
Committee aims to provide the Named Executive Officers with target Total Direct
Compensation that is at or very close to the median value of the corresponding
compensation provided to executives with similar responsibilities at companies
in the Benchmarking Groups.
However, the Committee adjusts the
incentive compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers to reflect each
individuals actual individual performance during the previous year.
For additional information
concerning the manner in which the compensation of the Named Executive Officers
is determined and the role of the Compensation Committee and its advisors, see

2015 BASE SALARY
AND TARGET TOTAL CASH COMPENSATION
The Committee considers changes in the
base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation of the Named Executive Officers
at least annually. As part of its normal process to progress new senior
executives to a level of compensation that is commensurate with their
responsibilities, the Committee also periodically considers adjustments to the
base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation of new senior executives whose
rate of pay is set below the market median. All adjustments, if any, are made
only after considering the most recent compensation data available to the
Committee for executives with similar responsibilities at companies in the
Benchmarking Groups, each individuals position in the salary range for his or
her position, and the individuals job performance.
At the time of his appointment to the
position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in June 2014, Mr.
Gangestads base salary and total Target Cash Compensation were set at 70
percent of the median paid to executives serving in similar positions at
companies in the Benchmarking Groups. In January 2015, the Committee approved
the following increase in the base salary and target Total Cash Compensation of
Mr. Gangestad. This increase was intended to bring Mr. Gangestads target Total
Cash Compensation up to 75 percent of the median value of the corresponding
compensation paid to executives serving in similar positions at companies in the
Benchmarking Groups.

As a result of these increases, the
target Total Cash Compensation of these Named Executive Officers ranged from 76
to 107 percent of the median value of the corresponding compensation provided to
executives with similar responsibilities at companies in the Benchmarking
Groups.
In August 2015, the Committee approved
the following increase in the base salary and target Total Cash Compensation of
Mr. Gangestad. This increase was designed to
bring his target Total Cash Compensation up to 80 percent of the median paid to
executives serving in similar positions at companies in the Benchmarking Groups.
Provided that Mr. Gangestad continues to perform at a satisfactory level, the
Committee expects to continue increasing his compensation periodically until his
total Target Cash Compensation reaches this median.

2015 ANNUAL
INCENTIVE
During 2015, the Committee provided the
Named Executive Officers with the opportunity to earn short-term incentive
compensation under the Executive Plan. Each Named Executive Officers target
annual incentive for the year was equal to the difference between his or
her target Total Cash Compensation and annual
base salary. Each of the Named Executive Officers was assigned to an appropriate
business unit (the entire Company, in some cases) established under the AIP for
the purpose of measuring business performance during 2015 and converting that
performance into a payout based on the AIPs formulas. While none of
the
2016 Proxy
Statement  |  47


Table of
Contents
Named Executive Officers are covered by
the AIP, the Committee rarely uses its discretion under the Executive Plan to
pay the covered executives (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything
other than the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been
participating in the AIP (including the individual performance
multiplier).
The amounts payable under the AIP for
2015 were based on the following performance results for the Company and, as
applicable, the respective business units to which the Named Executive Officers
were assigned:

Since the Company satisfied the
Executive Plans performance objective by earning Adjusted Net Income of $4.833
billion for 2015, the plan authorized the Committee to approve payments of
annual incentive compensation to each Named Executive Officer equal to
one-quarter of one percent of such Adjusted Net Income ($12,082,500). As
explained above, however, the Executive Plan authorizes the Committee to pay
each covered executive less than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. At its meeting in February
2016, the Committee approved (and with respect to Mr. Thulin, the independent
members of the Board of Directors ratified) payment of the following amounts of
annual incentive compensation under the Executive Plan for 2015, which it
believes more closely aligns the payout to each individual with the 2015
performance of the Company and the assigned business units as well as the
individuals performance:

* These amounts are prorated to
reflect the increases in Total Cash Compensation described above that resulted
in corresponding increases in each individuals target annual incentive
compensation.
The Committee determined the amount of
Mr. Thulins annual incentive compensation for 2015 by considering first what
his payout would have been if he participated in the broad-based AIP (including
the performance multiplier). The Committee went on to consider other factors in
determining the amount of his payout, including Mr. Thulins responsibility for
delivering the Companys strong financial results, his success in building a
strong leadership team, his efforts to position the Company for future success
through a continued focus on the three strategic levers of portfolio management,
investing in innovation, and business transformation, and the annual
incentive/bonus compensation provided to CEOs of the companies in 3Ms executive
peer group.
Consistent with its past practice, the
Committee utilized its discretion to pay each Named Executive Officer other than
Mr. Thulin the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been
participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance
multiplier).
LONG-TERM
INCENTIVES  2015 ANNUAL GRANTS
After considering the most recent
long-term incentive compensation data from companies in the Benchmarking Groups
and after taking into account its evaluation of their individual performance
during 2014, the Committee approved (and in the case of Mr. Thulin, the
independent members of the Board of Directors ratified) the following target
compensation values for the Named Executive Officers 2015 long-term incentive
compensation awards. For ease of comparison, the following table also shows the
target compensation values of the Named Executive Officers 2014 long-term
incentive compensation awards.

* Reflects the fact that these
annual awards were granted before Mr. Gangestad was promoted to the position of
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Consistent with market practices at
companies in the Benchmarking Groups, during 2015, the Committee chose to
deliver one-half of the initial estimated value of the annual long-term
incentive compensation awards provided to 3Ms Named Executive Officers in the
form of stock options and the remaining one-half in the form of performance
shares.
2015 Stock
Options
Stock options granted to the Named
Executive Officers as part of their long-term incentive compensation have the
following features: 


●
an exercise price equal to the
      closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the date of
      grant;

●
a ratable three-year vesting
      schedule; and

●
a maximum term of 10
      years.
2015 Performance
Share Awards
Performance shares awarded in 2015 will
result in the issuance of actual shares of 3M common stock to 3Ms Named
Executive Officers if the Company achieves certain financial goals over the
years 2015, 2016, and 2017. The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be
issued for each 2015 performance share is linked to the Companys performance as
measured by the criteria of Organic Volume Growth (40 percent weighting), Return
on Invested Capital (20 percent weighting), Free Cash Flow Conversion (20
percent weighting), and Earnings Per Share Growth (20 percent weighting). These
performance criteria were selected because they are aligned with 3Ms operating
plan and the financial objectives communicated to stockholders and the Committee believes that they are important drivers of
long-term stockholder value. Attainment of these four independent performance
criteria is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year
measurement period, with each year weighted as follows (2015  50 percent; 2016
 30 percent; and 2017  20 percent). However, the formulas by which the
Companys performance is measured do not change over the three-year performance
period.
The actual number of shares of 3M
common stock that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance
period ending on December 31, 2017, may be anywhere from 0 percent to 200
percent of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the
Company during the performance period. However, an executive may forfeit all or
a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain employed by the Company
throughout the three-year performance period.
For awards tied to the achievement of
performance goals over the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, the Committee approved
the following formulas for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be
delivered for each performance share awarded, with the total number of shares
actually delivered being the sum of the number of shares earned as a result of
the Companys achievement of each of the four financial goals. In the event that
the Companys performance as measured by any of these performance criteria falls
between any of the percentages listed below, the number of shares of 3M common
stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.

The above formulas are not a
prediction of how 3M will perform during the years 2015 through 2017. The sole
purpose of these formulas, which were approved by the Committee in February
2015, is to establish a method for determining the number of shares of 3M common
stock to be delivered for the performance share awards described above. 3M is
not providing any guidance, nor updating any prior guidance, of its future
performance with the disclosure of these formulas, and you are cautioned not to
rely on these formulas as a prediction of 3Ms future
performance.

Long-Term Incentives  All Outstanding
Performance Share Awards
The Companys annual award cycle and
three-year performance periods result in an overlap of awards. For example, the
performance goals for 2015 performance share awards relate to the years 2015,
2016, and 2017. Similarly, the performance goals for 2014 performance share
awards relate to the years 2014, 2015, and 2016, and so on, as shown below. Performance
against the goals established for each award are measured separately for each
calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as shown
below in parenthesis. The Committee believes this structure reduces motivation
to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest level rewards
only by building sustainable long-term results.

*** Mr. Gangestad was appointed to
the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective June
6, 2014.
Although shares of 3M common stock
are accrued annually for each outstanding performance share award, an executive
may forfeit all or a portion of the shares otherwise issuable pursuant to his or
her award if he or she does not remain employed by the Company throughout the
entire three-year performance period.

SECTION IV: WAYS IN WHICH WE ADDRESS
      RISK AND GOVERNANCE
STOCK OWNERSHIP
GUIDELINES
The Company maintains robust stock
ownership guidelines that apply to all Section 16 officers of the Company and
are designed to increase an executives equity stake in 3M and more closely
align his or her financial interests with those
of 3Ms stockholders. The following table shows the stock ownership guideline
for each Named Executive Officer and their compliance status as of December 31,
2015:

* As a result of his appointment to
the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr.
Gangestads required level of ownership increased, effective June 6, 2014, from
a multiple of two times his base annual salary to a multiple of three times his
annual base salary. Mr. Gangestad is not required to attain his new level of
required ownership until June 6, 2019.
The stock ownership guidelines provide
that the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each covered
executive will be calculated based on such executives annual base salary at the
time of initial appointment to a Section 16 position and at the time of a
position change from one multiple level to another multiple level, and the fair
market value of 3M common stock at that time. Beginning December 31, 2013, and
every three years thereafter, the stock ownership guidelines require the Company
to recalculate the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each
covered executive using their annual base salary and fair market value of 3M
common stock at the recalculation date.
The stock ownership guidelines provide
that each covered executive should attain the required beneficial ownership of
3M stock within five years of their initial appointment to a position covered by
the guidelines or a position change from one multiple level to another multiple
level. The guidelines also provide that each covered executive whose required
level of ownership increases as a result of a periodic recalculation will have
three years from the recalculation date (or the balance of the five-year period
since the date of their initial appointment or latest position change, if
longer) to attain the required level of ownership. However, if a covered
executive is not making adequate progress to meet the required level of
ownership within the applicable time period, the guidelines provide that he or
she will be required to hold and not sell a sufficient number of the after-tax
3M shares received upon the next payout of performance shares to be on track to
satisfy the required ownership level.
For purposes of these guidelines,
shares owned directly by a covered executive or by members of the covered
executives immediate family, shares owned indirectly through a covered
executives account in the Companys 401(k) plan or another deferred
compensation plan, unvested shares of restricted stock owned by a covered
executive, and shares represented by unvested restricted stock units granted to
a covered executive are all considered to be
beneficially owned by the covered executive and are counted in determining
attainment of the required ownership level.
For more information concerning the 3M
stock ownership of the Named Executive Officers, see the section entitled
Security Ownership of Management beginning on page 80 of this Proxy
Statement.
PROHIBITION OF
HEDGING AND PLEDGING
The Companys stock trading policies
prohibit the Companys executive officers from (i) purchasing any financial
instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value
of the Companys common stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts,
equity swaps, collars and exchange funds; (ii) engaging in short sales related
to the Companys common stock; (iii) placing standing orders; (iv) maintaining
margin accounts; and (v) pledging 3M securities as collateral for a loan. All
transactions in 3M securities by directors and executive officers must be
pre-cleared with the Deputy General Counsel.
POLICY ON
REIMBURSEMENT OF INCENTIVE PAYMENTS (CLAWBACK)
The Companys Board of Directors has
adopted a policy requiring the reimbursement of excess incentive compensation
payments made to an executive in the event that 3M is required to make a
material restatement of its financial statements. This policy applies to all
senior executives of the Company including all of the Named Executive Officers.
This policy does not require any misconduct on the part of the covered executive
whose excess incentive compensation payment is being reimbursed. As long as the
Company is required to make a material restatement of its financial statements
that causes an incentive compensation payout to be higher than it should have
been, the Company may seek to
52  |  3M


Table of Contents
recover the overpayment from all
affected executives irrespective of whether their conduct contributed to the
need for the restatement. The Company established this policy prior to the
passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, which establishes new requirements for such
policies. Upon issuance by the Securities and Exchange Commission of final
implementing regulations for the Dodd-Frank Acts requirements, the Company will
make any changes to its existing policy as may be required to comply with those
regulations.
ASSESSMENT OF RISK
RELATED TO COMPENSATION PROGRAMS
Based on the Companys recent
assessment, the Company has determined that none of its compensation policies
and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. To conduct this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its
executive and non-executive compensation programs globally, with particular
emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. Based on this inventory,
the Company evaluated the primary components of its compensation plans and
practices to identify whether those components,
either alone or in combination, properly balanced compensation opportunities and
risk. The Company believes that the Companys overall cash versus equity pay
mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term performance focus, balance of
revenue versus profit focused performance measures, stock ownership guidelines,
and clawback policy all work together to provide its employees and executives
with incentives to deliver outstanding performance to build long-term
stockholder value, while taking only necessary and prudent risks. In this
regard, the Companys strong ethics and its corporate compliance systems, which
are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate against excessive or
inappropriate risk taking. The Compensation Committee, with assistance from its
independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of Frederic W. Cook &
Co., Inc., reviewed the Companys risk assessment and a separate risk assessment
that Mr. Paulin conducted for the Committee on the Companys executive compensation
policies and practices. Based on their consideration of these assessments, the
Committee concurred with the Companys determination that none of its
compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.
COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE REPORT
In accordance with the Securities and
Exchange Commissions disclosure requirements for executive compensation, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of 3M Company (the Committee)
has reviewed and discussed with 3M Management the Compensation Discussion and

Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that this Compensation
Discussion and Analysis be included in the 2016
Proxy Statement of 3M Company and 3M Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015.

(1) The amounts shown reflect 3M
matching and additional automatic contributions under the tax-qualified 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. All eligible
employees under this plan may receive 3M matching contributions on their pre-tax
or Roth 401(k) contributions to the plan on up to six percent (five percent
beginning in 2016) of their eligible pay. Eligible employees hired on or after
January 1, 2009, also receive additional automatic 3M retirement income
contributions equal to three percent of their eligible pay.
(2) The amounts shown reflect 3M
matching contributions under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined
contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and its matching contributions is
limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal
income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits
eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash
compensation beyond the contribution limits established by Federal tax laws, and
to receive Company matching contributions similar to the matching contributions
provided under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.
(3) The amounts shown reflect the
amount of premiums paid by the Company on behalf of each individual with respect
to their respective universal life or term life insurance policies obtained for
them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.
(4) These amounts reflect fees for
personal financial planning and tax return preparation services paid by the
Company on behalf of each individual.
(5) This amount reflects the
aggregate incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Thulins personal use of
corporate aircraft during 2015. This aggregate incremental cost was calculated
by combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of
fuel, landing fees, parking fees, trip preparation fees, enroute communication
charges, enroute navigation charges, on-board catering, and crew travel
expenses. The Compensation Committee requires Mr. Thulin to use the corporate
aircraft for all business and personal travel.
(6) This amount reflects the
expenses incurred by 3M during 2015 for home security equipment and monitoring
services at the personal residence of Mr. Thulin.
(7) This amount reflects the
aggregate incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Thulins personal use of a
Company-provided automobile and local ground transportation. These costs include
lease payments for the vehicle, fuel, insurance premiums, repairs, and
maintenance.

(1) Abbreviations for the Type of
Grant: 15PS = 2015 performance shares; Option = stock options; AIP = annual
incentive.
(2) The amounts shown as the
Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards reflect the
target and maximum amounts that may be earned by each individual during 2015
under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. This plan establishes a maximum
amount of annual incentive compensation that may be earned by each covered
executive during a plan year (established for purposes of complying with Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code), which for each of the Named Executive
Officers was one-quarter of one percent of the Companys Adjusted Net Income for
2015, and then permits the Compensation Committee to pay each covered executive
less than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since
the Executive Annual Incentive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Compensation
Committee has rarely used this discretion to pay a covered executive (other than
our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive
would have received had he or she been participating in the Companys
broad-based Annual Incentive Plan (see Elements of the Compensation Program 
Annual Incentive in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this Proxy
Statement).
(3) The amounts shown as the
Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards with respect to 2015
performance shares reflect the threshold, target, and maximum number of shares
of 3M common stock that may be earned by each individual as a result of the 2015
performance shares granted to each individual during 2015 under the 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The actual number of shares of 3M common stock to be
delivered as a result of these performance shares will be determined by the
performance of the Company during the three-year performance period of 2015,
2016, and 2017, as measured against four performance criteria selected by the
Compensation Committee (Organic Volume Growth, Return on Invested Capital,
Earnings Per Share Growth and Free Cash Flow Conversion). For more information
on these performance criteria and the formulas for determining the number of
shares of 3M common stock payable as a result of these performance shares,
please refer to the Long-Term Incentives  2015 Annual Grants portion of the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this Proxy Statement.
(4) The amounts shown as the All
Other Option Awards reflect the number of shares of 3M common stock subject to
nonqualified stock options granted to each individual during 2015 under the 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The options granted on February 3, 2015, were part of
the Companys annual grant of stock options to the approximately 6,000 employees
participating in the plan, and they vest in installments of one-third on each of
the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
(5) The exercise price for all stock
options granted under the Companys 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is set at the
closing price at which 3M common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange on
the option grant date.
(6) The amounts in the Grant Date

* A portion of Mr. Thulins benefits
will actually be paid by a pension plan maintained by the Companys subsidiary
in Sweden (based on the years he was employed in Sweden before transferring to
the United States), and the amount paid by this plan in Sweden will reduce the
amount paid by the Employee Retirement Income Plan.
The Employee Retirement Income Plan
(ERIP) is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by 3M for
its eligible employees in the United States. Effective January 1, 2001, the
Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees
hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily
elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice election period in
2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning
that employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009, do not participate
in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Gangestad, Mr.
Kelly, and Mr. Delgado participate under the non-pension equity formula of the
ERIP (the Portfolio I Plan), while Mr. Vale participates under the pension
equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Plan). Retirement benefits under
the ERIP are based on an employees years of service and average annual earnings
during the employees four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied
to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base
salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the
ERIP by the Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life
annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their employment ends to
receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a
single lump-sum cash payment.
Under the Portfolio I Plan, employees
earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of
their high-four average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service
plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a
Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their
years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint
is an average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years
ending with the year each employee qualifies for receiving unreduced Social
Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire
with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and
1959, respectively). If the employees age and service at the time of retirement
total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942 and 1959,
respectively) the employee also would receive a Social Security bridge payment
until age 62. Mr. Thulin is eligible to retire with unreduced early retirement
benefits. Mr. Kelly retired from the Company effective as of January 1, 2016,
and elected to receive reduced early retirement benefits, with the reduction
being equal to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each year that he
retired prior to age 61. Mr. Delgado is eligible to retire with reduced early
retirement benefits, with the reduction being equal to 5 percent of the pension
otherwise payable for each year that he retires prior to age 62.
Under the Portfolio II Plan, employees
earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment
based on their age and accumulated years of service under the plan. Once their
employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their
high-four average annual earnings and added to an amount determined by
multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four
average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70
percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in the year employment ends).

60  |  3M

Table of Contents
The sum of these two amounts is then
converted into an annuity payable over the lifetime of the employee using fixed
conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan does not provide any subsidies for
early retirement.
As a tax-qualified plan, the ERIP is
subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employees
earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits earned under the
plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The
Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide additional benefits to
employees, including the Named Executive Officers, affected by these limits. The
amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified
Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to
earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The
benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan are generally paid in the
form of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their
employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal tax laws). Current
employees were given a onetime opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive their
benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan in the form of a life
annuity following their retirement, and none of the Named Executive Officers
elected to receive their benefits in the form of a life annuity.


NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The following table reflects the
participation during 2015 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified
deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred Compensation
Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until
retirement from the Company the receipt of base salary and the portion of their
annual incentive compensation paid in cash. The Performance Awards Deferred
Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or
until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance share or
performance unit awards under the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess
Plan allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the
receipt of base salary and the portion of their annual incentive compensation paid in cash. All three plans generally allow the
eligible employees to elect to receive payment of their account balances in the
form of either a single lump sum payment or in up to ten annual installments.
With the exception of deferrals of performance shares under the Performance
Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are credited to the amounts deferred
under all three plans based on the returns paid on the investment funds
available to participants in 3Ms qualified 401(k) plan or a fixed rate of
return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each participant).
Earnings are credited to the deferrals of performance shares under the
Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan based on the return on shares of
3M common stock, including reinvested dividends.

FOOTNOTES TO 2015 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED
COMPENSATION TABLE
(1) With the exception of the
amounts contributed by Mr. Kelly and Mr. Delgado from the payout of their annual
incentive compensation earned during 2014, all amounts contributed by these
individuals during 2015 have been included in the Summary Compensation Table as
Salary or Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation earned in 2014 or 2015. Since
Mr. Vale was not a named executive officer for 2014, the Summary Compensation
Table does not reflect any of his 2014 annual incentive compensation from which
this contribution was made during 2015.
(2) All amounts contributed by the
Company on behalf of these individuals during 2015 are included in the All
Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.
(3) None of these amounts is
included in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation earned in 2015, since
none of the Companys nonqualified deferred compensation plans provide
above-market or preferential earnings.
(4) Includes the following amounts

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS
      UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
As reflected in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment
agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers nor does it have any
severance or change in control plans or arrangements that would provide
severance benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers in the event of the
termination of their employment or a change in control of the Company. We also
do not have any agreements that would provide automatic single-trigger
accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to
any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the
Company. However, certain of the Companys executive compensation and benefit
plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers) with
certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination
of their employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The terms
applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are
described below. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that
are generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated
employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not
described, including (a) accrued base salary; (b) annual incentive earned with
respect to completed performance periods; (c) retiree welfare benefits provided
to substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees, including retiree medical
benefits; (d) distribution of vested account balances under the Companys
qualified 401(k) plan; (e) accrued pension benefits under the Companys defined
benefit pension plans payable following an employees retirement or other
termination of employment (the amounts of these benefits earned by the Named
Executive Officers are reported in the 2015 Pension Benefits Table); (f) life
insurance benefits generally available to all salaried employees; and (g)
distribution of account balances under the Companys nonqualified deferred
compensation plans (the amount of these account balances of the Named Executive
Officers are reported in the 2015 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Table).
RIGHTS
AND PAYMENTS UPON RETIREMENT 
Following retirement (as described
below), the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive: 


●

continued vesting of stock
      options previously granted under the Companys stock plans, and
      the opportunity to exercise vested stock
      options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the
      original term (up to 10 years) of such options;

●

for those Named Executive
      Officers whose initial appointment to a 3M executive position occurred
      prior to January 1, 2006, payment for all previously granted performance
      shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period
      (prorated to reflect the portion of the year worked only with respect to
      the performance shares granted in the year of retirement);
    and

●

for those Named Executive
      Officers whose initial appointment to a 3M executive position occurred on
      or after January 1, 2006, payment for all previously granted performance
      shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period
      (prorated to reflect the portion of the three-year performance period that
      occurred prior to the date of the Named Executive Officers
      retirement).
For this purpose, the term Retirement
means a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with
at least five years of service (age 55 with at least 10 years of service for
awards granted on or after January 1, 2016).
RIGHTS AND PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION DUE TO DISABILITY
In the event of the termination of
their employment due to disability, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to
receive: 


●

continued vesting of stock
      options previously granted under the Companys stock plans, and the
      opportunity to exercise vested stock options previously granted under such
      plans during the remainder of the original term (up to 10 years) of such
      options;

●

immediate vesting of all
      restricted stock units previously granted under the Companys stock plans;
      and 

●

payment for all previously
      granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year
      performance period.

RIGHTS AND PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION DUE TO DEATH
In the event of the termination of
their employment due to death, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to
receive:


●

immediate vesting of all unvested
      stock options and restricted stock units previously granted under the
      Companys stock plans, and the opportunity for the Named Executive
      Officers estate or beneficiaries to exercise all vested stock options
      within the two years following the date of death (but not beyond the
      original expiration date of any such stock option);

●

payment to the Named Executive
      Officers estate or beneficiaries no later than March 15 of the year
      following the year in which the Named Executive Officer died for all
      previously granted performance shares (in the same amount as paid for the
      performance shares granted to other Named Executive Officers if the date
      of death occurs after the end of the three-year performance period for
      such shares, and at the lesser of the target value or such other amount as
      determined by the Committee in its discretion if the date of death occurs
      before the end of the three-year performance period for such shares);
      and

●

payment to the Named Executive
      Officers beneficiaries of the proceeds from the life insurance policies
      provided for such Named Executive Officer pursuant to the Companys
      Executive Life Insurance Plan.
RIGHTS AND PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION FOR ANY OTHER REASON
In the event of the termination of
their employment for any reason other than retirement, death, or
disability:


●

the Named Executive Officers will
      have the opportunity to exercise vested stock options granted under the
      Companys stock plans within the first 90 days following the termination
      date (but not beyond the original expiration date of any such stock
      option), at which time any remaining vested stock options are forfeited;
      and 

●

all unvested stock options,
      restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to the Named
      Executive Officers are forfeited
immediately.
RIGHTS AND PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL
In the event of the termination of a
Named Executive Officers employment without Cause or if the Named Executive
Officer resigns for Good Reason within 18 months following a change in control
event of the Company (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code), all of such Named Executive Officers outstanding unvested stock
options and restricted stock units granted under the Companys stock plans will
be immediately vested and all of such Named Executive Officers outstanding
performance shares will be prorated and settled in accordance with the terms of
the plan.
For purposes of these awards, Cause
means a material violation of any policy of the Company, or embezzlement or
theft of property belonging to the Company, and Good Reason means (i) a
material diminution in the Named Executive Officers position, authority,
duties, or responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change in
control; (ii) a material diminution in the Named Executive Officers base salary
or annual planned cash compensation; or (iii) a material change in the
geographic location at which the Named Executive Officer is required to perform
services for the Company.
The amounts payable to or on behalf of
each of the Named Executive Officers in each of the above situations (other than
amounts relating to payments or benefits generally provided on a
non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees) is reflected in
the following table, assuming that each individuals employment had terminated
and/or a change in control of the Company had occurred on December 31, 2015. As
of December 31, 2015, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Kelly, and Mr. Delgado were eligible to
retire (as that term is defined for purposes of 3Ms stock plans). Mr. Kelly
retired from the Company effective January 1, 2016.

APPROVAL OF THE
2016LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
PROPOSAL NO. 4:
APPROVAL OF THE 2016 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
3Ms Board of Directors (the Board)
is seeking stockholder approval of the 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan
(the 2016 Plan). The 2016 Plan will become effective on the day of the Annual
Meeting, assuming approval of this proposal by 3Ms stockholders.
The Board has
adopted, subject to stockholder approval, the 2016 Plan for 3Ms employees and
directors. The Board is seeking approval of the 2016 Plan as the successor to
the 3M 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 3M 2005 Management Stock Ownership
Program and the other prior equity incentive plans of 3M or its predecessor (collectively, the Prior Plans). If the 2016
Plan is approved by the stockholders, the Board will not grant any future awards
under the Prior Plans, however, the terms and conditions of the Prior Plans will
continue to govern any outstanding awards thereunder. If the stockholders do not
approve the 2016 Plan, the 2016 Plan will not become effective.
The following description of the 2016
Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2016
Plan, which is attached hereto as Appendix B.


WHY
      STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD VOTE TO APPROVE THE 2016
  PLAN
EQUITY INCENTIVE
AWARDS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY
3M believes that the adoption of the
2016 Plan is essential to its success. Equity awards are intended to motivate
high levels of performance, align the interests of 3Ms employees and directors
with those of its stockholders by giving employees and directors the perspective
of an owner with an equity stake in the Company and providing a means of
recognizing their contributions to the success of the Company. The Board and
Company management believe that equity awards are necessary to remain
competitive in the industry and are essential to recruiting and retaining the
highly qualified individuals who help the Company meet its goals.
OUR EXISTING EQUITY
PLANS WILL NO LONGER HAVE SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT
Under the Companys current forecasts,
3Ms existing equity plans will run out of shares available for grant within the
next 12 months, and the Company will not be able to continue to issue equity to its employees and directors unless its
stockholders approve the 2016 Plan. This assumes 3M continues to grant awards
consistent with its historical usage and current practices, as reflected in its
historical burn rate discussed below, and noting that future circumstances may
require the Company to change its current equity grant practices. While 3M could
increase cash compensation if it is unable to grant equity incentives, 3M
anticipates that it will have difficulty attracting, retaining and motivating
its employees and directors if it is unable to make equity grants to
them.

PLAN

2016 Proxy Statement  |  65


Table of Contents
In determining whether to approve the
2016 Plan, including the share reserve under the 2016 Plan, the Board considered
the following:


●
The shares to be initially
      reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan
      will represent an increase of 23,965,000
      shares from the aggregate number of shares
      reserved for issuance and that remain available for future grant under the
      Prior Plans at the time the 2016 Plan becomes effective. If the 2016 Plan is approved, it will represent the only equity plan
      under which 3M will be able to grant future
      equity awards (other than the General
      Employees Stock Purchase Plan) and 3M will
      no longer grant awards under the Prior
      Plans.

●
The average annual share pool
      usage over the most recently completed
      three-year period. In calendar years 2013,
      2014 and 2015, 3Ms annual equity burn
      rates (calculated by dividing (1) the number of shares subject to
      equity awards granted during the year by (2) the weighted-average
      number of shares outstanding at the end of the applicable year)
      under the Prior Plans were 1.13 percent,
      1.07 percent and 1.03 percent,
      respectively. If each Full Value Award (as
      defined below) is multiplied by 3.5 (consistent with the methodology
      employed by certain proxy advisory firms), the adjusted annual burn rate
      under the Prior Plans would be 1.62
      percent, 1.52 percent and 1.40 percent for
      calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015,
      respectively.

●
3M expects the share reserve
      under the 2016 Plan to provide the Company
      with enough shares for awards for
      approximately four years, assuming 3M continues to grant awards
      consistent with its current practices and historical usage, as reflected in
      its historical burn rate, and further
      dependent on the price of 3M shares and
      hiring activity during the next few years,
      forfeitures of outstanding awards under the
      Prior Plans, and noting that future circumstances may require 3M
      to change its current equity grant practices. 3M cannot predict its future equity
      grant practices, the future price of its
      shares or future hiring activity with any
      degree of certainty at this time, and the
      share reserve under the 2016 Plan could last for a shorter or longer time.


●
The potential dilution to our
      stockholders that may result from the issuance of shares pursuant to outstanding awards
      and awards to be issued under the 2016 Plan. In calendar years 2013, 2014
      and 2015, the end of year overhang rate (calculated by dividing (1) the sum of the
      number of shares subject to equity awards outstanding at the end of the
      calendar year plus shares remaining available for issuance for future awards at
      the end of the calendar year by (2) the number of shares outstanding at the
      end of the calendar year) was 11.23 percent, 9.91 percent, and 9.04 percent,
      respectively. If the 2016 Plan is approved, 3M expects its overhang at the
      end of 2016 will be approximately
      11.35 percent (excluding the 27.1
      million shares that may be available for issuance under the General Employees Stock Purchase
      Plan).

●
Analysis by 3Ms compensation
      consultant, which was based on generally accepted evaluation methodologies used
      by proxy advisory firms, that the number of shares to be reserved under the
      2016 Plan is within generally accepted standards as measured by an analysis of
      the 2016 Plan cost relative to industry standards.
In light of the factors described
above, and the fact that the ability to continue to grant equity compensation is
vital to 3Ms ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified
individuals in the extremely competitive labor markets in which it competes, the
Board has determined that the size of the share reserve under the 2016 Plan is
reasonable and appropriate at this time. The Board will not create a
subcommittee to evaluate the risk and benefits for issuing shares under the 2016
Plan.
EQUITY COMPENSATION
BEST PRACTICES REFLECTED IN THE 2016 PLAN
The 2016 Plan contains a number of
provisions that 3M believes are consistent with best practices in equity
compensation and which protect its stockholders interests.


●
Continued Broad-Based Eligibility for Equity
      Awards. 3M grants equity awards to a significant number of its
      service providers. By doing so, 3M links their interests with stockholder
      interests throughout the organization and motivates these individuals to
      act as owners of the business. As of March 2, 2016, 6,669 of 3Ms active
      employees and 11 of its non-employee directors held outstanding equity
      awards.

●
Stockholder Approval is Required for Additional
      Shares. The 2016 Plan does not contain an annual evergreen provision. The
      2016 Plan authorizes a limited number of shares, so that stockholder
      approval is required to increase the maximum number of shares of common
      stock which may be issued under the 2016 Plan.

●
No
      Discount Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. All stock options
      and stock appreciation rights will have an exercise price equal to or
      greater than the fair market value of 3Ms common stock on the date the
      stock option or stock appreciation right is granted; provided, that
      discount stock options may be granted in the event stock options are
      assumed or substituted in connection with certain corporate transactions.
      For purposes of the 2016 Plan, the fair market value of a share of common
      stock as of any given date generally will be the closing sale price for a
      share of our common stock on the stock exchange or national market system
      on which our common
66  |  3M


Table of Contents



stock is listed
      on such date or, if no sale occurred on the
      date in question, the closing sale price for a share of our common stock on the last preceding date
for which such quotation exists, as reported
      in The Wall Street Journal or another
      source the Company deems reliable. The
      closing sale price for a share of our
      common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, on March 2, 2016 was $159.41, as reported in The Wall
      Street Journal.

●
No
      Automatic Single-Trigger Vesting of Awards. The  2016 Plan does not provide for automatic
      single-trigger accelerated vesting upon a change in
    control.

●
Limitations on Dividend Payments on
      Performance Awards. Dividends
      and dividend equivalents may 
be paid on awards subject to performance
      vesting  conditions only to the extent such conditions are
    met.

●
Limitations on
      Grants. Individual limits on awards  granted to any
      participant pursuant to the 2016 Plan  during any calendar
      apply as follows: (i) a maximum 
of 500,000 shares of common stock may be
      subject  to all options and stock appreciation rights granted  to a participant;
      (ii) a maximum of 500,000 shares  of common stock may
      be earned subject to all  restricted stock, restricted stock units,
      performance  shares and other stock- or cash-based awards  granted to a
      participant that are intended to qualify as  performance-based
      compensation under Section 
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the
      Code);  and (iii) a maximum of $10,000,000 may become  payable (in cash,
      shares or any combination thereof)  pursuant to
      performance bonus awards granted to  a participant;
      provided that, these numbers may be  adjusted to take
      into account equity restructurings  and certain other
      corporate transactions as  described below and will be multiplied by two
      with  respect to awards granted to a participant during the  calendar year in
      which the participant commences 
employment with the Company or its
      subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, in no event will more  than the authorized
      number of shares available for 
issuance under the 2016 Plan be granted to any
      one  person during any calendar year with respect to one  or more awards
      denominated in shares. For purposes  of these limits,
      each share subject to an award 
(including a Full Value Award) will count as one
      share  against the specified limit.


●
Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit.
      An  annual limit of
      $600,000 per calendar year applies  to the sum of all
      cash and other compensation and 
the value of all equity, cash-based and other
      awards  granted to a non-employee director for services as a  member of the
      Board.


●
Reasonable Limit on Full Value Awards.
      For purposes  of calculating the
      shares that remain available for  issuance under the
      2016 Plan, grants of options 
and stock appreciation rights will be counted
      as  the
      grant of one share for each one share actually  granted, as
      described above. However, to protect  stockholders from
      potentially greater dilutive effect  of Full Value
      Awards, all grants of Full Value Awards  will be deducted
      from the 2016 Plans share reserve  as 2.5 shares for
      every one share actually granted. 

●
No
      Repricing of Awards. Awards may
      not be  repriced, replaced or regranted through cancellation  or modification
      without stockholder approval if the  effect would be to
      reduce the exercise price for the  shares under the
      award. 

●
No
      Tax Gross-Ups. The 2016 Plan does
      not provide  for any tax gross-ups.
STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL REQUIREMENT
In general, stockholder approval of the
2016 Plan is necessary in order for 3M to meet the stockholder approval
requirements of the principal securities market on which shares of its common
stock are traded, and grant stock options that qualify as incentive stock
options, or ISOs, as defined under Section 422 of the Code. Stockholder approval
also may be required to grant certain restricted stock units to French employees
that provide more favorable tax and social treatment to the local employer
subsidiary and its employees than would otherwise apply.
Although 3M has not adopted a policy
that all compensation paid to executive officers must be deductible, stockholder
approval of the material terms of the 2016 Plan also is necessary to preserve
the Companys ability to provide qualified performance-based compensation
(which we refer to as QPBC) that will be tax deductible without regard to the
limits of Section 162(m) of the Code (as described below under the heading
Limitations on the Employers Compensation
Deduction). The material terms of the 2016
Plan include, without limitation, the classes of individuals eligible to receive
awards, the award limits and the performance criteria described below under the
heading Performance-Based Awards. There is no
guarantee that incentive compensation that the Company pays to its covered
employees will qualify as QPBC for purposes of Section 162(m), but stockholder
approval of the material terms of the 2016 Plan will permit the administrator to
seek to structure incentive compensation to meet the performance-based
compensation requirements if it chooses to do so.
2016 Proxy Statement  |  67


Table of Contents
In August 2015, a new French law (Loi
Macron) introduced changes that provide more favorable tax and social treatment
of restricted stock units meeting certain requirements (we refer to restricted
stock units meeting such requirements as French-qualified RSUs). The changes
provide benefits for both the local employer subsidiary and the employees
receiving the awards. Among other requirements, under the new law,
French-qualified RSUs must provide for a minimum vesting period of one year from
the grant date and restrict the sale of shares for a minimum of two years from
the grant date. The 2016 Plan contains provisions that would allow the
administrator to grant restricted stock units on such terms and authorizes the
adoption of one or more subplans to address differences in laws (including
differences relating to tax matters), but the new law also provides that grants of French-qualified RSUs must be authorized by the
stockholders at a meeting after August 7, 2015. As a result, stockholder
approval of the 2016 Plan is being requested for purposes of the new French law
in order to provide the administrator with the ability to grant French-qualified
RSUs. The administrator will not, however, be obligated to grant
French-qualified RSUs and may choose, at its discretion, to grant restricted
stock units that are not considered French-qualified RSUs.
Therefore, 3M is asking stockholders to
approve the terms of the 2016 Plan for purposes of complying with the
requirements of the NYSE, satisfying the stockholder-approval requirements of
Sections 422 and 162(m) of the Code and satisfying the stockholder-approval
requirements of the new French law (Loi Macron) discussed above.


DESCRIPTION OF THE 2016
    PLAN
The following sets forth a description
of the material features and terms of the 2016 Plan.
Authorized
Shares. The 2016 Plan authorizes the
issuance of the sum of:


●

23,965,000 shares of common stock; plus

●

the aggregate number of shares of common stock
      that remain available for future awards under the Prior Plans as of the
      effective date of the 2016 Plan;
plus


●
for each award that is
      outstanding under the Prior Plans as of the effective date of the 2016
      Plan, (i) one share for each share subject to an award that is an option
      or stock appreciation right and (ii) 2.5 shares for each share subject to
      an award other than an option or stock appreciation right (or other award
      subject to an exercise price, strike price or similar concept) (a Full
      Value Award), in each case, that subsequently becomes available for
      issuance under the 2016 Plan pursuant to the share counting provisions
      described below.
As of March 2, 2016, there were
11,447,488 shares available for future awards under the Prior Plans, 42,505,335
shares subject to outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights under
the Prior Plans, and 3,298,906 shares subject to outstanding Full Value Awards
under the Prior Plans. Assuming no additional awards are granted under the Prior
Plans prior to the date of the Annual Meeting, a maximum of an additional
50,752,600 shares could become available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan
in respect of outstanding awards under the Prior Plans pursuant to the terms of
the 2016 Plan. In the event additional awards are issued under the Prior Plans
prior to the date of the Annual Meeting, the initial share reserve of the 2016
Plan will be reduced but the number of shares that could become available for
future issuance under the 2016 Plan in respect of outstanding awards under the
Prior Plans will be higher.
The aggregate number of shares
available for issuance under the 2016 Plan will be reduced by 2.5 shares for
each share delivered in settlement of any Full Value Award and by one share for
each share delivered in settlement of any option or stock appreciation right.
Shares issued under the 2016 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares, shares
purchased on the open market or treasury shares.
In no event will more than
34,000,000 shares of common stock be issuable pursuant to the exercise of ISOs
under the 2016 Plan during its ten-year term.
Share Counting
Provisions. If an award under the 2016
Plan or a Prior Plan expires, lapses or is terminated, exchanged for cash,
surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully exercised or
forfeited, in any case, in a manner that results in 3M acquiring shares covered
by the award or Prior Plan award at a price not greater than the price (as
adjusted to reflect any equity restructuring) paid by the participant for the
shares or not issuing one or more shares covered by the award or Prior Plan
award, the unused shares covered by the award or Prior Plan award will, as
applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the 2016 Plan.
In addition, shares delivered to the Company to satisfy the applicable exercise
or purchase price of an award under the 2016 Plan or a Prior Plan or to satisfy
any tax withholding obligation (including shares retained by the Company from
the award being exercised or purchased and/or creating the tax obligation) will,
as applicable, become or again be available for award grants under the 2016
Plan. For any shares granted pursuant to an award under the 2016 Plan or a Prior
Plan, the shares available under the 2016 Plan will be increased by 2.5 shares
for each share subject to a Full Value Award and by one share for each share
subject to an option or stock appreciation right, in each case, that become or
again be available for issuance pursuant to the foregoing share counting
provisions of

the 2016 Plan. Dividend equivalents
paid in cash will not be counted against the number of shares reserved under the
2016 Plan.
Administration.
The 2016 Plan will be administered by
the compensation committee or a subcommittee thereof (or by the Board or another
Board committee as may be determined by the Board from time to time). The
administrator of the 2016 Plan (the Administrator) or its delegate will have
the authority to determine which service providers receive awards and
set the
terms and conditions applicable to the award within the confines of the 2016
Plans terms. The Administrator will have the authority to make all
determinations and interpretations under, prescribe all forms for use with, and
adopt rules for the administration of, the 2016 Plan.
Award Limits for
Employees. The 2016 Plan includes
annual limits on awards that may be granted to any individual participant. For
participants other than non-employee directors, the maximum aggregate number of
shares of common stock with respect to all options and stock appreciation rights
that may be granted to any one person during any calendar year is 500,000 and
the maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be earned with
respect to all restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and
other stock- or cash-based awards that are intended to qualify as QPBC under
Section 162(m) of the Code that may be granted to any one person during any
calendar year is 500,000. The maximum aggregate amount that may become payable
(in cash, shares of common stock, or any combination thereof) pursuant to all
performance bonus awards that may be paid to any one person during any calendar
year is $10,000,000. These numbers will be multiplied by two with respect to
awards granted to a participant during the calendar year in which the
participant commences employment with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will more than the authorized number
of shares available for issuance under the 2016 Plan be granted to any one
person during any calendar year with respect to one or more awards denominated
in shares. These numbers may be adjusted to take into account equity
restructurings and certain other corporate transactions as described below. For
purposes of these individual award limits, each share subject to an award
(including a Full Value Award) will be counted as one share against the
specified limit.
Compensation
Limit for Non-Employee Directors. The
sum of all cash or other compensation and the value (determined as of the grant
date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 (or any successor thereto)) of all
awards granted to a non-employee director under the 2016 Plan during any
calendar year for services as a member of the Board may not exceed $600,000.
This limit applies to all compensation provided
as a non-employee director, whether or not such compensation is provided under
the 2016 Plan.
Eligibility.
Employees and non-employee directors
of 3M or any of its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2016
Plan. As of March 2, 2016, 3M and its subsidiaries had approximately 90,053
active employees and 12 non-employee directors who would have been eligible to
receive awards under the 2016 Plan had it been in effect on such
date.
Types of Awards.
The 2016 Plan provides for the grant
of stock options (including ISOs and nonqualified stock options), stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance bonus
awards, performance shares and other stock- or cash-based awards. Awards to
eligible individuals will be subject to the terms of an individual award
agreement between 3M and the individual. A brief description of each award type
follows.


●

Stock
      Options. Stock options may be granted under the 2016 Plan,
      including both ISOs and non-qualified stock options, which
      provide the holder a right to purchase
      shares of common stock at a specified
      exercise price. The exercise price per
      share for each stock option will
      be set by the Administrator, but will not
      be less than the fair market value on the date of grant (or 110
      percent of the price of an ISO in the case of an individual
      who, on
      the date of grant, owns or is deemed to own shares representing more
      than 10 percent of the stock of 3M
      or any parent corporation or subsidiary
      corporation within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code); provided, that the
      Administrator may grant stock
      options with an exercise price that is less
      than the fair market value on the date of grant in the event stock options are assumed
      or substituted in connection with
      certain corporate transactions. The term of
      any option award may not be longer than ten years (or five years
      in the
      case of an ISO granted to a 10 percent stockholder of 3M). The
      Administrator will determine the time
      period for exercise of each award,
      including the time period for exercise following a termination of
      service by the recipient, subject to the maximum ten year
      term. 

●

Stock Appreciation
      Rights. The Administrator is
authorized to grant stock appreciation rights
      to eligible recipients in its discretion,
      on such terms and conditions as it may
      determine, consistent with the 2016 Plan. A
      stock appreciation right entitles the holder to exercise the stock appreciation right to acquire shares of 3Ms common stock upon exercise
within a specified time period from the date of
      grant. Subject to the provisions of the
      stock appreciation right award agreement,
      the recipient may receive from the Company
      an amount determined by multiplying the
      difference between the price per share of the stock appreciation right and the value of the
      share
2016 Proxy Statement  |  69


Table of Contents



on the date of exercise by the number of
      shares of common stock subject to the
      award. The maximum term for which stock
      appreciation rights may be exercisable
      under the 2016 Plan is ten years.

●
Restricted
      Stock.
      The Administrator may make awards of
      restricted stock to eligible individuals in such amounts and
      at purchase prices (if any) to
      be established by the Administrator in
      connection with each award. Such awards will be subject to restrictions and
      other terms and conditions as are
      established by the Administrator. Upon
      issuance of restricted stock, recipients generally have the rights of a stockholder
      with respect to such shares, subject
      to the limitations and restrictions
      established by the Administrator in the individual award
      agreement. Such rights generally include
      the right to receive dividends and other distributions in relation to
      the award; however, dividends may be paid with respect to restricted stock
      with performance-based vesting
      only to the extent the performance
      conditions have been satisfied and the restricted stock
      vests.

●
Restricted Stock
      Units.
      The 2016 Plan authorizes awards of
      restricted stock units to eligible individuals in amounts and at
      purchase prices (if any) and upon
      such other terms and conditions as are
      established by the Administrator for each award. Restricted stock unit awards
      entitle recipients to acquire shares
      of 3Ms common stock in the future under
      certain conditions. Holders of restricted stock units generally have no rights of
      ownership or as stockholders in
      relation to the award, unless and until the
      restrictions lapse and the restricted stock unit award vests in accordance with the
      terms of the grant. Restricted
      stock units may be accompanied by the right
      to receive the equivalent value of dividends paid on shares of the
      Companys common stock prior to
      the delivery of the underlying shares
      (i.e., dividend equivalent rights); however, dividend equivalents
      with respect to an award with performance-based vesting that are based on
      dividends paid prior to the vesting
      of such award will only be paid out to the
      holder to the extent that the performance-based vesting conditions are
      subsequently satisfied and the award
      vests. The Administrator may provide that
      settlement of restricted stock units will occur upon or as soon as reasonably
      practicable after the restricted stock units vest or will
      instead be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the
      participants election.
      

●
Performance
      Shares.
      The Administrator is authorized to grant
      performance shares under the 2016 Plan. Performance shares will be denominated in shares of common stock,
      unit equivalents and/or units of
      value (including a dollar value of shares
      of common stock) and may be linked to any one or more of the performance
      criteria listed below, or other
      specific criteria determined by the
      Administrator, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any
      period or periods determined by the Administrator. The Administrator will also determine
      whether performance shares are
      intended to be QPBC under Section
      162(m) of the Code.


●
Performance Bonus Awards. Performance bonus awards will be
      denominated in cash and will be initially payable in cash,
      but may be paid in cash, shares or a
      combination of cash and shares in the
      discretion of the Administrator. Performance bonus awards will be payable upon the
      attainment of performance goals
      that are established by the Administrator
      and relate to any one or more of the performance criteria listed below, or other
      specific criteria determined by the
      Administrator, in each case on a specified
      date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Administrator. The
      Administrator will also determine
      whether performance bonus awards are
      intended to be QPBC under Section 162(m) of the
Code.

●
Other
      Stock- or Cash-Based Awards. Other stock- or
      cash-based awards are awards of cash, fully
      vested shares of 3Ms common stock and other awards valued wholly or
      partially by referring to, or otherwise based on, shares of
      3Ms common stock. Other stock- or cash-based awards may be granted
      to participants and may also be available as a payment form in the
      settlement of other awards, as standalone payments and as
      payment in lieu of compensation
      otherwise payable to any individual who is
      eligible to receive awards. The Administrator will determine the terms and
      conditions of other stock- or cash-based awards, including
      any purchase price, performance
      goals (which may be based on the
      performance criteria discussed above or other performance criteria), transfer
      restrictions and vesting
conditions.
Performance-Based Awards.
 The Administrator will determine whether specific awards are intended to
constitute QPBC and even if stockholders approve the performance criteria set
forth in the 2016 Plan for purposes of the QPBC exception, the Administrator may
determine to pay compensation that is not QPBC under Section 162(m) and that is
not deductible by reason thereof.
In order to constitute QPBC under Section
162(m), in addition to certain other requirements, the relevant amounts must be
granted, vest or become exercisable or payable only upon the attainment of
pre-established, objective performance goals set by the Administrator and linked
to stockholder-approved performance criteria. For purposes of the 2016 Plan, one
or more of the following performance criteria will be used in setting
performance goals applicable to QPBC, either for the entire Company or a
subsidiary, division, business segment, business unit, or an individual, and may
be used in setting performance goals applicable to other stock- or cash-based
awards: (i) net earnings or losses (either before or after one or more of (A)
interest, (B) taxes, (C) depreciation, (D) amortization, and (E) non-cash
equity-based compensation

expense); (ii) gross or net sales or
revenue or sales or revenue growth; (iii) gross or net organic sales volume or
organic sales volume growth, (iv) net income (either before or after taxes) or
adjusted net income; (v) sales from one or more products (or categories of
products) as a percentage of total sales or revenue; (vi) profits (including but
not limited to gross profits, net profits, profit growth, net operation profit
or economic profit), profit return ratios or operating margin; (vii) operating
earnings (either before or after taxes or before or after allocation of
corporate overhead and bonus); (viii) cash flow (including operating cash flow,
free cash flow, free cash flow conversion or cash flow return on capital); (ix)
return on assets; (x) return on capital or invested capital; (xi) cost of
capital; (xii) return on stockholders equity; (xiii) total stockholder return;
(xiv) return on sales; (xv) costs, reductions in costs and cost control
measures; (xvi) expenses; (xvii) working capital; (xviii) earnings or loss per
share (EPS) or EPS growth; (xix) adjusted earnings or loss per share; (xx)
price per share or dividends per share (or appreciation in or maintenance of
such price or dividends); (xxi) regulatory achievements or compliance; (xxii)
implementation, completion or attainment of objectives relating to research,
development, regulatory, commercial, or strategic milestones or developments;
(xxiii) market share; (xxiv) economic value or economic value added models;
(xxv) division, group or corporate financial goals; (xxvi) customer
satisfaction/growth; (xxvii) customer service; (xxviii) employee satisfaction;
(xxix) recruitment and maintenance of personnel; (xxx) human resources
management; (xxxi) supervision of litigation and other legal matters; (xxxii)
strategic partnerships and transactions; (xxxiii) financial ratios (including
those measuring liquidity, activity, profitability or leverage); (xxxiv) debt
levels or reductions; (xxxv) sales-related goals; (xxxvi) financing and other
capital raising transactions; (xxxvii) cash on hand; (xxxviii) acquisition
activity; (xxxix) investment sourcing activity; and (xl) marketing initiatives,
any of which may be measured in absolute terms or as compared to any incremental
increase or decrease, peer group results, or market performance indicators or
indices. Any performance goals that are financial metrics may be determined in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), in
accordance with accounting principles established by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB Principles), or may be adjusted when
established to include or exclude any items otherwise includable or excludable
under GAAP or under IASB Principles.
The 2016 Plan also permits the
Administrator to provide for objectively determinable adjustments to the
applicable performance criteria in setting performance goals for QPBC awards,
including adjustments for (i) restructurings, discontinued operations, special
items, and other unusual, infrequently occurring or non-recurring charges,
events or items; (ii) asset sales or write-downs; (iii) litigation or claim
judgments or settlements; (iv) acquisitions or
divestitures; (v) reorganization or change in the corporate structure or capital
structure of the Company; (vi) an event either not directly related to the
operations of the Company, subsidiary, division, business segment or business
unit or not within the reasonable control of management; (vii) foreign exchange
gains and losses; (viii) a change in the fiscal year of the Company; (ix) the
refinancing or repurchase of bank loans or debt securities; (x) unbudgeted
capital expenditures; (xi) the issuance or repurchase of equity securities and
other changes in the number of outstanding shares; (xii) conversion of some or
all of convertible securities to common stock of the Company; (xiii) any
business interruption event; (xiv) changes in pricing; (xv) changes in foreign
currency exchange rates; (xvi) the cumulative effects of tax or accounting
changes in accordance with GAAP; (xvii) unusual tax transactions; or (xviii) the
effect of changes in other laws or regulatory rules affecting reported
results.
Prohibition on
Repricing. Under the 2016 Plan, the
Administrator may not, without the approval of 3Ms stockholders, authorize the
repricing of any outstanding option or stock appreciation right to reduce its
price per share, cancel any option or stock appreciation right in exchange for
cash or another award when the price per share exceeds the fair market value of
the underlying shares, or take any other action with respect to an option or
stock appreciation right that the Company determines would be treated as a
repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal U.S. national
securities exchange on which the shares of common stock are listed.
Certain
Transactions. The Administrator has
broad discretion to take action under the 2016 Plan, as well as make adjustments
to the terms and conditions of existing and future awards, to prevent the
dilution or enlargement of intended benefits and facilitate necessary or
desirable changes in the event of certain transactions and events affecting 3Ms
common stock, such as dividends or other distributions (whether in the form of
cash, common stock, other securities, or other property), reorganizations,
mergers, consolidations, change in control events and other corporate
transactions. In addition, in the event of certain non-reciprocal transactions
with 3Ms stockholders known as equity restructurings, the Administrator will
make equitable adjustments to outstanding awards. No adjustment or other action
will be authorized for awards that are intended to qualify as QPBC, which would
cause such awards to fail to continue to qualify as QPBC, unless the
Administrator determines that the award should not so qualify. No automatic
single-trigger vesting acceleration applies under the 2016 Plan in connection
with a change in control event.
Amendment and
Termination. The Board or the
Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate the 2016
Plan at any time and
2016 Proxy Statement  |  71

from time to time. However, no
amendment requiring stockholder approval to comply with applicable laws will be
effective unless approved by the Board and 3Ms stockholders and no amendment,
other than an amendment that increases the number of shares available under the
2016 Plan, may materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be
delivered under an outstanding award as of the date of such amendment without
the consent of the affected participant. Stockholder approval is required for
any amendment to the 2016 Plan to the extent necessary to comply with applicable
laws. The 2016 Plan provides that in no event may an award be granted pursuant
to the 2016 Plan after ten years from the effective date of the 2016 Plan.

Forfeiture and
Claw-backs. All awards (including the gross
amount of any proceeds, gains or other economic benefit obtained in connection
with any award) made under the 2016 Plan are subject to recoupment by the
Company to the extent required to comply with applicable laws or any policy of
the Company providing for the reimbursement of incentive
compensation.
Securities Laws. The 2016 Plan is intended to conform to all provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and any and all regulations and rules promulgated by the SEC
thereunder, including, without limitation, Rule 16b-3. The 2016 Plan will be
administered, and awards will be granted and may be exercised, only in such a
manner as to conform to such laws, rules and regulations.



UNITED STATES
      FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
The following summary is based on an
analysis of the Code, existing laws, judicial decisions, administrative rulings,
regulations and proposed regulations, in each case, as of March 2, 2016.
Moreover, the following is only a summary of United States federal income tax
consequences. Other kinds of taxes, such as state, local and foreign income
taxes and federal employment taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and
subject to change. Actual tax consequences to participants or the Company may be
either more or less favorable than those described below depending on the
particular circumstances. 
ISOs. No income will be recognized by a participant upon the grant or exercise
of an ISO. The basis of shares transferred to a participant upon exercise of an
ISO is the price paid for the shares. If the participant holds the shares for at
least one year after the transfer of the shares to the participant and two years
after the grant of the option, the participant will recognize capital gain or
loss upon sale of the shares received upon exercise equal to the difference
between the amount realized on the sale and the basis in the shares. Generally,
if the shares are not held for that period, the participant will recognize
ordinary income upon disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair
market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the
shares, or if less (and if the disposition is a transaction in which loss, if
any, will be recognized), the gain on disposition. Any additional gain realized
by the participant upon the disposition will be a capital gain. The excess of
the fair market value of shares received upon the exercise of an ISO over the
option price for the shares is an item of adjustment for the participant for
purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Therefore, although no income is
recognized upon exercise of an ISO, a participant may be subject to alternative
minimum tax as a result of the exercise.
Non-Qualified Stock
Options. No income is expected to be
recognized by a participant upon the grant of a non-qualified stock option. Upon
exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the participant will recognize
ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the
shares on the date of exercise over the amount paid for the shares. Income
recognized upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option will be considered
compensation subject to withholding at the time the income is recognized, and,
therefore, the participants employer must make the necessary arrangements with
the participant to ensure that the amount of the tax required to be withheld is
available for payment. Non-qualified stock options generally provide the
employer with a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by
the participant at the time of the recognition by the participant, subject to
the deduction limitations described below.
Stock Appreciation Rights.
Participants are not expected to recognize
income upon receiving a grant of stock appreciation rights. Generally, the
participant will recognize ordinary income subject to withholding upon the
receipt of payment pursuant to stock appreciation rights in an amount equal to
the aggregate amount of cash and the fair market value of any common stock
received. Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer
generally will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount
includible in the participants income. 
Restricted Stock. If the restrictions on an award of shares of restricted stock
are of a nature that the shares are both subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture and are not freely transferable (within the meaning of Section 83 of
the Code), the participant will not recognize income at the time of the award
unless the participant affirmatively elects to include the fair market value of

72  |  3M


Table of
Contents
the shares of restricted stock on the
date of the award, less any amount paid for the shares, in gross income for the
year of the award pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. In the absence of this
election, the participant will be required to recognize income on the date the
shares either become freely transferable or are no longer subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code),
the fair market value of the shares of restricted stock on such date, less any
amount paid for the shares. The employer will be entitled to a deduction at the
time of income recognition to the participant in an amount equal to the amount
the participant is required to include in income with respect to the shares,
subject to the deduction limitations described below. If a Section 83(b)
election is made within 30 days after the date the restricted stock is received,
the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of the receipt of the
restricted stock, and the employer will be entitled to a corresponding
deduction, equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time, less the
amount paid, if any, by the participant for the restricted stock. If a Section
83(b) election is made, no additional income will be recognized by the
participant upon the lapse of restrictions on the restricted stock, but, if the
restricted stock is subsequently forfeited, the participant may not deduct the
income that was recognized pursuant to the Section 83(b) election at the time of
the receipt of the restricted stock.
Dividends paid to a participant holding
restricted stock before the expiration of the restriction period will be
additional compensation taxable as ordinary income to the participant subject to
withholding, unless the participant made an election under Section 83(b).
Subject to the deduction limitations described below, the employer generally
will be entitled to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the dividends
includible in the participants income as compensation. If the participant has
made a Section 83(b) election, the dividends will be dividend income, rather
than additional compensation, to the participant.
If the restrictions on an award of
restricted stock are not of a nature that the shares are both subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture and not freely transferable, within the meaning
of Section 83 of the Code, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the
time of the transfer of the shares in an amount equal to the fair market value
of the shares of restricted stock on the date of the transfer, less any amount
paid therefore. 
The employer will be entitled to a
deduction at that time in an amount equal to the amount the participant is
required to include in income with respect to the restricted shares, subject to
the deduction limitations described below.
Restricted Stock Units and Deferred
Stock. A recipient of restricted stock units
or deferred stock generally should not recognize ordinary income at the time of
grant. Generally, the participant will recognize
ordinary income subject to withholding upon the receipt of cash and/or transfer
of shares of common stock in payment of the restricted stock units or deferred
stock in an amount equal to the aggregate of the cash received and the fair
market value of the common stock so transferred. Subject to the deduction
limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a
corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participants
income.
A participant generally will recognize
ordinary income subject to withholding upon the payment of any dividend
equivalents paid with respect to an award in an amount equal to the cash and the
fair market value of any common stock the participant receives. Subject to the
deduction limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled
to a corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the
participants income.
Performance Shares and Performance
Bonus Awards. Participants are not expected
to recognize income upon the grant of performance shares or performance bonus
awards. Generally, the participant will recognize ordinary income subject to
withholding at the time of payment, vesting or settlement of the award based on
the fair market value of the award on that date. Subject to the deduction
limitations described below, the employer generally will be entitled to a
corresponding tax deduction equal to the amount includible in the participants
income.
Limitations on the Employers
Compensation Deduction. Section 162(m) of the
Code limits the deduction certain employers may take for compensation in excess
of $1 million paid in a given year to its chief executive officer and certain of
its other most highly-compensated executive officers (these officers are
generally referred to as the covered employees), unless the compensation is
qualified performance-based compensation (which we refer to as QPBC). In
order to be considered QPBC, the compensation must be performance-based, granted
pursuant to a plan approved by the employers stockholders, and meet certain
other criteria. Stock options and stock appreciation rights that may be granted
under the 2016 Plan generally should qualify as QPBC. Other awards that the
Company may grant under the 2016 Plan (including performance-based awards) also
may qualify as QPBC if certain procedural requirements are met. 
Excess Parachute
Payments. Section 280G of the Code limits the
deduction that an employer may take for otherwise deductible compensation
payable to certain individuals if the compensation constitutes an excess
parachute payment. Excess parachute payments arise from payments made to
disqualified individuals that are in the nature of compensation and are
contingent on changes in ownership or control of the employer or 
2016 Proxy

certain affiliates. Among other things,
excess parachute payments could result from grants made during the 12-month
period preceding a change in ownership or control of the employer or its
affiliates and accelerated vesting or payment of awards under the 2016 Plan upon
a change in ownership or control of the employer or its affiliates. In addition
to the deduction limitation applicable to the employer, a disqualified
individual receiving an excess parachute payment is subject to a 20 percent
excise tax on the amount thereof.
Application of Section 409A of the
Code. Section 409A of the Code imposes an
additional 20 percent tax and interest on an individual receiving non-qualified
deferred compensation under a plan that fails to satisfy certain requirements.
For purposes of Section 409A, non-qualified deferred compensation includes
equity-based incentive arrangements, including some stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock unit awards, performance share awards and
other awards that may be granted under the 2016 Plan. Generally speaking,
Section 409A does not apply to ISOs, non-discounted non-qualified stock options
and stock appreciation rights if no deferral is provided beyond exercise, or
restricted stock. 
The awards made pursuant to the 2016
Plan are expected to be designed in a manner intended to comply with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent the awards granted under
the 2016 Plan are not exempt from coverage. However, if the 2016 Plan fails to
comply with Section 409A in operation, a participant could be subject to the
additional taxes and interest.
State, local and foreign tax
consequences may in some cases differ from the United States federal income tax
consequences described above. The foregoing summary of the United States federal
income tax consequences in respect of the 2016 Plan is for general information
only. Interested parties should consult their own advisors as to specific tax
consequences of their awards.
The 2016 Plan is not subject to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and is not intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.



PLAN
      BENEFITS
Awards under the 2016 Plan are subject
to the discretion of the Administrator and no determinations have been made by
the Administrator as to any awards that may be granted pursuant to the 2016
Plan. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be
received in the future by participants in the 2016 Plan or the benefits that
would have been received by such participants if the 2016 Plan had been in
effect in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, 3Ms non-employee directors are eligible to receive certain compensation each year, a portion of which is payable
in the form of common stock or deferred stock, as described above under
Director Compensation and Stock Ownership
Guidelines. If the 2016 Plan is approved,
the non-employee director compensation payable in the form of common stock or
deferred stock will be issued under the 2016 Plan following the effective date
of the 2016 Plan. No awards have been issued under the 2016 Plan as it is not
yet effective.



RECOMMENDATION AND
      VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of the 2016 Plan will require
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
3M common stock represented in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote thereon.



RECOMMENDATION OF
      THE BOARD
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends
a vote FOR this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be
voted FOR this proposal unless a stockholder indicates otherwise in voting the
proxy.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
PROPOSAL NO. 5: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL ON
SPECIAL MEETINGS
3M has received a stockholder proposal
from James McRitchie, 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, CA 95758, the owner of 84 shares of 3M
common stock (the Proponent). The Proponent has requested that the Company
include the following proposal and supporting statement (in italics) in its proxy
statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The proposal may be voted on at the
Annual Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponents
qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponents
statement, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this
proposal.

Resolved: Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary
(unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing
document to give holders in the aggregate of 15% of our outstanding common stock
the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal does not impact
our boards current power to call a special meeting.
A shareholder right for a group
owning 15% of the shares of our company to call a special meeting is one method
to equalize our lack of a right for shareholders to act by written consent. If
15% of shares could call a special meeting - this would help make up for our
total lack of a right to act by written consent.
A shareholder right to call a
special meeting is a way to bring an important matter to the attention of both
management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. Shareowner input
on the timing of shareowner meetings is especially important when events unfold
quickly and issues may become moot by the next annual meeting. This is important
because there could be 15-months between our annual meetings.
It may be possible to adopt this
proposal by incorporating brief text similar to this into our governing
documents:
Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes,
unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be called by the Chairman of the
Board or the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or
President or Secretary upon the order in writing of a majority of or by
resolution of the Board of Directors, or at the request in writing of
stockholders owning 15% of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued
and outstanding and entitled to vote.
Please vote to enhance shareholder value:
Special Shareowner Meetings  Proposal 5



BOARDS STATEMENT
      OPPOSING THE PROPOSAL
After careful consideration, and for
the reasons set forth below, the Board believes that the proposal to ask our
Board to take the steps necessary to give holders of 15 percent of our outstanding common stock
the right to call special stockholder meetings, subject to the conditions
specified in the proposal, is not in the best interests of 3M or its
stockholders for the following reasons: 
1. Stockholders already have a
meaningful right to call a special meeting. The Companys Bylaws permit the
holders of 25 percent of 3Ms outstanding stock to call a special stockholder meeting
upon written request to the Board. In light of
our strong corporate governance practices and the many stockholder protections
already in place, the Board believes that giving stockholders owning
25 percent of the
Companys outstanding stock the ability to call special stockholder meetings
strikes the appropriate balance between giving stockholders the ability to call
special meetings to vote on important matters that arise between Annual Meetings
and protecting the resources of the Company and interests of all stockholders.
The Board has an established protocol for stockholders to communicate with our
independent Lead Director, the chairs of the Board committees, and other
independent directors. Management engages 
76  |  3M


Table of
Contents
in outreach to listen to and solicit
input from our stockholders. Lowering the threshold to 15 percent could force
the Company to expend a great deal of time and money on a special meeting, as
described below, even if up to 85 percent of the Companys stockholders do not want a special
meeting. 
2. Given the size of the Company and
the number of its stockholders, convening a meeting of stockholders is a
significant undertaking that requires a substantial commitment of time and
financial resources. The Company must pay to prepare, print, and distribute
legal disclosure documents to stockholders, solicit proxies, and tabulate votes.
The Board and management must also divert time from the business to prepare for
and conduct the meeting. Because of these burdens and costs to a company,
special stockholder meetings should be extraordinary events that occur only when
a substantial percentage of the stockholders agree there are extremely pressing
matters that must be addressed before the next Annual Meeting. The current
provision of the Bylaws allows for stockholders to call a special meeting when
such an extraordinary event arises, without enabling a small minority of
stockholders to call meetings more frequently than necessary. We believe that if
less than 25 percent of the stockholders want a special meeting, this
demonstrates that the need for a special meeting is not so great as to warrant
disrupting the conduct of 3Ms business and imposing unnecessary costs on the
Company and its stockholders. Therefore, we believe it is unnecessary and would
be damaging to the Company and its stockholders to lower the current threshold
and give holders of only 15 percent of our outstanding stock the ability to call
an unlimited number of special meetings for any purpose at any time.
3. Special meetings could also be
misused by special interest stockholder groups. The proposal with its low 15
percent ownership requirement could subject the Company to disruption from
special interest stockholder groups with an agenda not in the best interests of
the Company or the majority of stockholders. Currently, special meetings of
stockholders may be called by (i) a majority of the Board of Directors or the
Chairman of the Board, or (ii) the holders of 25 percent of 3Ms outstanding
stock upon written request to the Board. Each director has a fiduciary duty to
represent all stockholders when determining whether a matter is so pressing that
it must be addressed at a special meeting. By way of contrast, stockholders do
not have any fiduciary obligations to the Company or other stockholders.
Stockholders can be self-interested in ways that directors, bound by the duties
of care and loyalty, cannot be. The proposal would permit a small group of
stockholders who have a special interest to use the extraordinary measure of a
special meeting to serve their narrow self-interest. For example, would-be
acquirers who seek to take over the Company for an inadequate price could use
special meetings to avoid negotiating with the Board, which has the
responsibility to protect the interests of all stockholders. In fact, if this
proposal were implemented, a small group of stockholders would have the ability
to call a special meeting at their sole discretion, at any time, with no duty to
act other than in their own interests. 



RECOMMENDATION OF
      THE BOARD
The Board of Directors unanimously
recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of
Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a stockholder indicates
otherwise in voting the proxy.
2016 Proxy
Statement  |  77

PROPOSAL NO. 6: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL ON
SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
3M has received a stockholder proposal
from Domini Social Investments, 532 Broadway, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10012, the
owner of 115 shares of 3M common stock (the Proponent). The Proponent has
requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting
statement (in italics) in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual
Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponents qualified
representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponents statement,
your Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this
proposal.

Resolved: Shareholders of 3M Co. (the Company) urge the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors to adopt a policy that financial performance
metrics shall be adjusted, to the extent practicable, to exclude the impact of
share repurchases when determining the amount or vesting of any senior executive
incentive compensation grant or award. The policy should be implemented in a way
that does not violate existing contractual obligations or the terms of any
plan.
Supporting Statement
Stock buybacks directly affect many
of the financial ratios used as performance metrics for incentive pay of senior
executives. For example, stock buybacks can increase earnings per share, return
on assets, and return on equity. While stock buybacks may also boost stock
prices in the short term, we are concerned that they can deprive companies of
capital necessary for creating long term growth. 
In our view, senior executives are
responsible for improving our Companys operational performance, whereas the
Board of Directors is responsible for determining when stock buybacks are
appropriate. For this reason, we believe that senior executives should not
receive larger pay packages simply for reducing the number of shares
outstanding. Executive pay should be aligned with operational results, not
financial engineering.
For the 12 months ended June 30,
2015, S&P 500 companies spent more money on stock buybacks and dividends
than they earned in profits. S&P 500 companies spent a combined total of
$553 billion on stock repurchases and $369 billion on dividends, or 109 percent
of their earnings, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. This is a
concern because retained earnings are a primary source of new investment.
According to The Economist magazine, If firms are overdoing buy-backs and
starving themselves of investment, artificially propped-up share prices will
eventually tumble. (Corporate cocaine, September 13, 2014.) Large stock
buybacks send a discouraging message about a companys ability to use its
resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long
term, Laurence Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, wrote in an April 14, 2015
letter to S&P 500 companies.
Our Company spent $5.7 billion on
share buybacks in 2014, but only $1.8 billion on research and development, and
$1.5 billion on capital expenditures. Our Companys Chairman, CEO and President,
Inge Thulin received $20.1 million in total compensation in 2014, including $4.7
million in performance shares. The performance goal for these awards includes
earnings per share growth, a financial ratio that can be inflated by stock
buybacks.
For these reasons, we urge you to
vote FOR this proposal.



BOARDS STATEMENT
      OPPOSING THE PROPOSAL
After careful consideration, and for
the reasons set forth below, the Board believes it is not in the best interests
of 3M or its stockholders for the Board to adopt a policy that the Company shall
exclude the impact of share repurchases when determining senior executive
incentive compensation.
1. First, the Boards Finance Committee
thoroughly reviews the Companys capital needs and recommends to the Board for
approval the long-term capital structure of the Company to ensure that there is
sufficient capital to invest for future growth.
The Board reviews annually the Companys long-term strategic plans including the
amount of capital allocated to research and development, capital expenditures,
mergers and acquisitions, and the return of cash to stockholders through
dividends and stock repurchases. The Finance Committee monitors the investment
capital needs of the Company each quarter, along with dividends and stock
repurchases. Our Boards governance best practice of reviewing the long-term
strategic plans and approving the capital structure helps ensure the proper focus on
long-term growth and 
78  |  3M



Table of
Contents
prevents management from allocating
capital in order to maximize short-term financial results at the expense of
long-term value creation.
2. Second, the Boards Compensation
Committee, through consultation with its independent compensation consultant,
establishes 3Ms executive compensation program. The program is designed to
maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and executive
compensation by tying the incentive compensation our executives receive to the
achievement of performance metrics that we believe increase the Companys
long-term value. The incentive compensation opportunities provided to our
executives are based on multiple performance-based metrics. One example of this
is our performance share award program. The metrics used to determine the payout
of our performance share awards are closely aligned with the Companys long-term
financial objectives. In particular, the performance criteria used for the 2015
and 2016 performance share awards mirror the Companys long-term financial
objectives, except that adjustments are made to one metric (organic volume
growth) to exclude price and currency effects. This design creates alignment
among corporate performance, stockholders interests and executive compensation.
The Proponent has pointed to our performance share awards as having a connection
with earnings per share (EPS), which purportedly can be inflated by stock
buybacks.
It is true that EPS has a bearing on our performance share award
program. The four metrics that determine the extent to which performance share
awards are earned, and their respective weightings, are as follows:



i. Organic Volume Growth
      
40%

ii. Earnings Per Share Growth

20%

iii. Free Cash Flow Conversion

20%

iv. Return On Invested Capital

20%


●
Under our Performance Share        Plan, a minimum EPS growth rate of 7 percent
    is required in order for an        executive to receive any payout
    under the EPS Growth component of the plan. In reality, share        repurchases had no impact on the executives
    compensation prior to or        during 2015, because (a) EPS was not part of any metric used in our        performance share
    awards or other incentive compensation arrangements        prior to 2015, when it was added to our performance share metrics
    (as a        way to strengthen the link between executive pay and our stated strategic        drivers); and (b) the
    Companys EPS growth was below 7 percent for 2015,        resulting in no payout under this component, therefore share
    repurchases        did not impact pay.

●
The four financial metrics
      (referenced above) used for our performance share awards are
      self-governing, which helps to ensure that Company executives consider all
      metrics used to determine payouts under the Performance Share
      Plan. For example, deploying excessive amounts of cash toward share
      repurchases in order to solely maximize earnings per share would limit the
      potential to invest in projects that enhance organic sales volume growth,
      free cash flow conversion, or return on invested capital, which, together,
      drive 80 percent of the Performance Share Plan components to determine
      payout.

●
It is also important to note
      that the EPS metric is growth in EPS, not a
      specific EPS amount. EPS growth for any calendar year is calculated by
      dividing the EPS for such year by the EPS for the immediately preceding
      calendar year. Consequently, any increase in EPS attributable to share
      repurchases in one calendar year necessarily will make it more difficult
      for the Company to achieve its EPS growth target in the following calendar
      year.
3. Finally, the strength and diversity
of the 3M business model provides strong and consistent cash flow to invest in
the business for organic growth, pursue strategic acquisitions and return cash
to stockholders. The Proponent has expressed concerns that share repurchases can
deprive companies of capital necessary for creating long term growth. We
believe these concerns are unfounded, as demonstrated by our long-term track
record and our balanced capital allocation approach.


●
The Company is committed to
      investing in organic growth, most notably through capital expenditures and
      research and development. The Company has invested approximately $16
      billion in capital expenditures and research and development over the past
      five years to support organic growth programs. 3M has opened six customer
      technical centers around the world, and a new, state-of-the-art research
      and development laboratory in the United States.

●
The capital allocation plans
      have flexibility to respond quickly to strategic acquisition opportunities
      that can strengthen the Companys portfolio. Over the past 5 years, 3M has
      invested approximately $6 billion in strategic acquisitions to build upon
      and strengthen its business portfolio for continued future growth.

●
The
      Company has a long history of returning cash to stockholders, having paid
      nearly $10 billion in dividends over the past 5 years.

●
Finally, share repurchases
      represent the last component of 3Ms capital allocation plans. Over the
      past 5 years, 3M has returned approximately $21 billion to stockholders
      via share repurchases.


RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote
      AGAINST this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will
      be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a stockholder indicates otherwise
      in voting the proxy.

Corporation reported that, as of December 31, 2015, it and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries, acting in various capacities, had shared voting power
with respect to 44,784,794 shares of 3M common stock and shared dispositive

shares were held as trustee for certain 3M savings plans, including the
Companys Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M
Savings Plan, which are 401(k) retirement savings plans. State Street Bank and
Trust Company, an affiliate of State Street Corporation (State Street Bank)
provides custody, investment management, and corporate finance services to the
Company and a number of employee benefit plans sponsored by the Company and its
affiliates. The 3M Employee Retirement Income Plan, the 3M Voluntary Investment
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the 3M Savings Plan, and the 3M Employee
Welfare Benefit Association utilize State Street Global Advisors, an affiliate
of State Street Bank, as an investment manager for their respective employee
benefit plans. State Street Bank also provides custody services for the
Companys defined contribution plans in the U.S. Further, State Street Bank and
Trust Company is a participant of 3M Companys $3.75 billion revolving credit
agreement dated March 9, 2016. In total, the Company and the various employee
benefit plans paid fees of $2.3 million to State Street Bank and its affiliates
in 2015. The fees paid are regularly reviewed by the Company and the fiduciaries
of the employee benefit plans and are determined to be reasonable for the
services provided.

Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan use these
investments in their defined contribution investment choices. Fees paid for
investment management of these funds are incorporated into the fund NAV on a
daily basis and fully disclosed as an expense ratio for the funds. As a result,
these fees are paid by participants in the Companys defined contribution plans
and are not paid by the Company. The total amount of the fees will fluctuate
based on the plan participant allocation decisions. The fees are regularly
reviewed by the fiduciaries of the retirement plans and are determined to be
reasonable for the services provided.
(3) In a Schedule 13G/A filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 10, 2016, BlackRock, Inc.

various employee benefit plans paid fees of $3.5 million in 2015 to BlackRock,
Inc. and its affiliates, a majority of which was paid by the participants in the
U.S. Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The fees paid

INFORMATION ABOUT THE NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF
      PROXY MATERIALS
Why did I receive a
Notice of Internet Availability of the proxy materials and not the printed proxy
materials?
The
Securities and Exchange Commission allows companies to furnish their proxy
materials to stockholders over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many
of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead
of a paper copy of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing the notice
and proxy materials by e-mail to some of our stockholders who previously
consented to electronic delivery of proxy materials. Those stockholders should
have received an e-mail containing a link to the Web site where the proxy
materials are available, as well as a link to the proxy voting Web site. All
stockholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to
request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on
how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy
may be found in the notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how
you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access
them electronically in connection with future distributions of proxy materials.
Distributing proxy materials electronically conserves natural resources and
reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.
Why did I receive a
printed copy of the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability
of Proxy Materials?
We are
providing some of our stockholders, including stockholders who have previously
requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of
the proxy materials instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials.
How do I view the
proxy materials online?
Go to
www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions to view the materials. You will
need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow
located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see example
below  the information in the box is an example only  your number will be
different and is unique to you).

What if I prefer to
receive a paper copy of the proxy materials?
You can
easily request a paper copy at no cost by using one of the three methods below.
You will need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the
arrow located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see
example above  the information in the box is an example only  your number will
be different and is unique to you).




●By INTERNET at
      www.proxyvote.com;



●By
      TELEPHONE, toll-free at 1-800-579-1639; or



●By sending an E-MAIL to
      sendmaterial@proxyvote.com (simply provide in the
      subject line the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow
      from your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials; no other
      information is
  necessary).
Can I request to
receive my Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by e-mail rather
than by mail?
You may
request to receive proxy materials for all future meetings by e-mail by going to
www.proxyvote.com or www.investordelivery.com and
follow the electronic delivery enrollment instructions. If you choose to access
future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail with
instructions containing a link to the Web site where those materials are
available and a link to the proxy voting Web site. Your election to access proxy
materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.
Please note that you MAY NOT USE your
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to vote your shares; it is
NOT a form for voting. If you return the Notice of Internet Availability of
Proxy Materials in an attempt to vote your shares, that vote will not count.

STOCKHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
Each share of our common stock
outstanding as of the close of business on March 11, 2016, the record date, is
entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought
before the meeting. As of that date, there were 605,924,564 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding.
Most 3M stockholders hold their shares
through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee (which for simplicity we refer
to as a broker or other nominee) rather than directly in their own name. As
summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and
those owned beneficially:


STOCKHOLDER OF
      RECORD
       

If your shares are registered
      directly in your name with 3Ms transfer agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
      you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and the
      Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or if you requested
      paper delivery, a copy of these proxy materials are being sent directly to
      you by 3M. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your
      voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting. You may
      also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of
      Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading
      Voting Methods.

BENEFICIAL OWNER


If your shares are held by a
      broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares
      held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you
      by your broker or other nominee who is considered the stockholder of
      record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to
      direct your broker or other nominee on how to vote and are also invited to
      attend the meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record,
      you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting, unless you obtain
      a legal proxy from the broker or other nominee. Your broker or other
      nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for you
      to use. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in
      the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the
      heading Voting Methods. If you fail to provide voting instructions to
      your broker or other nominee, it will have discretion to vote your shares
      with respect to Proposal 2, but not with respect to Proposals 1, 3, 4, 5
      or 6, as described below under Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and
      Approve Each of the Proposals Described in this Proxy Statement.
      

PLAN ACCOUNTS


If your shares are held in your
      account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
      Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of
      these shares and the trustee of the plans is considered the stockholder of
      record. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock
      Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may direct the trustee on how to
      vote the shares allocated to their account via the Internet, by telephone,
      or by signing and submitting the proxy card as described in the Notice of
      Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading
      Voting Methods. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and
      Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may also direct the
      trustee how to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares of common
      stock for which it has not received direction by following the same voting
      instructions. If you fail to direct the trustee how to vote your shares by
      following these instructions, the trustee will vote your shares as
      described in the proxy card.

Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the persons
appointed by the Board as proxy holders  Nicholas C. Gangestad, Gregg M.
Larson, and Inge G. Thulin  will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly
presented for a vote at the meeting. If any of our nominees is unavailable as a
candidate for director, the above-named proxy holders will vote your proxy for
another candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board of
Directors.


VOTING REQUIREMENTS TO ELECT DIRECTORS AND
      APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY
    STATEMENT

QUORUM
       

The presence of the holders of a
      majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the
      Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to
      constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as
      present for purposes of determining a quorum. As discussed below, a
      broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for
      a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the
      broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that
      proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial
      owner.

BROKER VOTING


Under New York Stock Exchange
      (NYSE) rules, brokers have discretionary authority to vote their
      clients shares in routine matters (such as ratification of auditors) so
      long as the beneficial owner of those shares did not provide voting
      instructions to the broker at least ten days before the stockholder
      meeting. Director elections, stockholder proposals, and executive
      compensation matters, including say-on-pay proposals and the equity
      compensation plan, are not considered routine matters for these
      purposes. As a result, if you do not provide your broker with instructions
      as to how to vote your shares, your broker will be prohibited from voting
      on Proposals 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6, resulting in a broker non-vote with
      respect to those proposals.
If you are a beneficial owner
      (other than as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and
      Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan), your broker or
      other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting
      firm for 2016, even if it does not receive voting instructions from
      you.

Table of Contents


ELECTION OFDIRECTORS


In accordance with 3Ms Bylaws,
      each director is elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast (which
      means the number of votes cast for a directors election exceeds the
      number of votes cast against that directors election, with
      abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast either
      for or against that directors election) with respect to that
      directors election at any meeting for the election of directors at which
      a quorum is present. However, if the number of nominees exceeds the number
      of directors to be elected (a Contested Election) as of the tenth (10th)
      day preceding the date the Company first mails its notice of the meeting
      to its stockholders, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a
      plurality of the votes cast (which means that the nominees who receive the
      most affirmative votes will be elected to serve as directors).
For an election where the
      majority vote standard applies, the Nominating and Governance Committee
      has established procedures under which any incumbent director who is not
      elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. In the
      event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast
      in an election that is not a Contested Election, the Nominating and
      Governance Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of
      Directors, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to
      whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or
      whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on
      the resignation, taking into account the Committees recommendation, and
      publicly disclose (by issuing a press release and filing appropriate
      disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision
      regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the
      rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days following
      certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance
      Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in
      making its decision each may consider any factors and other information
      that they consider appropriate and relevant.
An incumbent director who fails
      to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a
      Contested Election (as defined above) and who tenders his or her
      resignation pursuant to the procedures described above shall remain active
      and engaged in Board activities while the Nominating and Governance
      Committee and the Board decide whether to accept or reject such
      resignation, or whether other action should be taken. However, it is
      expected that such incumbent director shall not participate in any
      proceedings by the Nominating and Governance Committee or the Board
      regarding whether to accept or reject such directors resignation, or
      whether to take other action with respect to such director.
If the Board of Directors accepts
      a directors resignation, or if a nominee for director is not elected and
      the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may
      fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the Bylaws.

ALL
      OTHERPROPOSALS
        

The affirmative FOR vote of a
      majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
      meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve
      Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In tabulating the voting result for any
      particular proposal, abstentions and, if applicable, broker non-votes
      are not counted as votes FOR or AGAINST the proposal. An abstention
      will, however, be counted as entitled to vote on a proposal and will,
      therefore, have the effect of a vote
AGAINST.
VOTING
METHODS
If you hold shares directly as the

COUNTING THE VOTE
In the election of directors, you may
vote FOR or AGAINST one or more of the nominees or you may ABSTAIN.
Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For
Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN, but
please note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST. If
you sign your proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting
instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations
of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan
and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the
trustee as described in Stockholders Entitled to Vote beginning on page
85.
Representatives of Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of
election.
CONFIDENTIALITY
The Companys Board of Directors has a
policy that all stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify
stockholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document will be
available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder will not
be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes must be
independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, stockholders
provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M
management.
RESULTS OF THE VOTE
We will issue a press release
announcing the preliminary voting results for items of business properly
presented at the meeting and will disclose the preliminary results for those
items (or final results if available) in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual
Meeting date. The press release with voting results will also be available on
our Web site at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml.
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO  STOCKHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS
Securities and Exchange Commission
rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement
to any household not participating in electronic proxy material delivery at
which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the stockholders are
members of the same family (a practice called
householding). We believe that householding benefits both you and the Company
by eliminating duplicate mailings to stockholders living at the same address and
by reducing our printing and mailing costs. Each stockholder will continue to
receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
Your household may have received a
single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy
now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by calling
1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com, by e-mailing
sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge,
51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively, if your household received
multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and members of your household who
are entitled to receive proxy materials would all prefer to receive only a
single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a request as specified in the
preceding sentence. 
If a broker or other nominee holds your
shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers
will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing stockholders to consent to
such elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does not request
continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer
stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings, you may
need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate
mailings to your household.
LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS
A list of the stockholders of record
entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection at the
Annual Meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting. The list also will be
available for ten days prior to the meeting between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and
4:30 p.m., Central Daylight Time, at our offices at 3M Austin Center, 6801 River
Place Blvd., Austin, Texas 78726, by contacting the Secretary of the
Company.
COST OF PROXY SOLICITATION
3M will pay for the cost of preparing,
assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials. You will
need to obtain your own Internet access if you choose to access the proxy
materials and/or vote over the Internet. In addition to mailing these proxy
materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by
telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and
employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for these
solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications,
Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the

solicitation of votes. We will pay
Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $20,000 plus expenses for
these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians,
nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for
forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners of
stock.
TRANSFER AGENT
Our transfer agent is Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A. All communications concerning stockholders of record accounts, including
address changes, name changes, common stock transfer requirements, and similar
issues can be handled by contacting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952

REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR
      NEXT YEARS ANNUAL MEETING
In order for a stockholder proposal to
be considered for inclusion in 3Ms Proxy Statement for next years Annual
Meeting, our Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal by November 23, 2016.
Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other
means that allows the stockholder to determine when the proposal was received by
the Company) to: Gregg M. Larson, Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and
Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-14W-06, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.

authorized representative at the meeting to present the proposal.
Alternatively, stockholders intending
to present a proposal at next years Annual Meeting without having it included
in the Companys Proxy Statement must comply with the requirements set forth in
the Companys Bylaws, a copy of which is available at www.3M.com under
Investor Relations  Governance. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that
our Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the stockholder no earlier
than the close of business on November 23, 2016, and no later than the close of
business on December 23, 2016. The notice must contain the information required
by our Bylaws.
Proposals received by the Corporate
Secretary after the dates mentioned will not be included in the Proxy Statement
or acted upon at next years Annual Meeting.

APPENDIX A - SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATEDSTATEMENT OF INCOME
INFORMATION
Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial
Measures(Millions, except per-share amounts)(Unaudited)
In addition to reporting financial
results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
the Company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude special items.
Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as net
income), and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common stockholders
(hereafter referred to as diluted earnings per share) are all measures for
which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding
special items). Special items are not in accordance with, nor are they a
substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or
credits that are important to an understanding of
the Companys ongoing operations. The Company uses these non-GAAP measures to
evaluate and manage the Companys operations. The Company believes that
discussion of results excluding special items provides a useful analysis of
ongoing operating trends. The determination of special items may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The reconciliation provided below
reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.

(a) During the fourth quarter of
2015, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring
actions primarily focused on structural overhead, largely in the U.S. and
slower-growing markets, with particular emphasis on Europe, Middle East, and
Africa (EMEA) and Latin America. This impacted approximately 1,700 positions
worldwide and resulted in a fourth-quarter 2015 pre-tax charge of $114
million.
The reconciliation provided below
reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures for the twelve months ended December 31:

(b) Free cash flow and free cash
flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for
income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company
defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less
purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the
entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The
Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net
income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash
flow conversion are useful measures of performance and uses these measures as an
indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate
cash.

(c) The Company uses non-GAAP
measures to focus on stockholder value creation. 3M uses Return on Invested
Capital (ROIC), defined as annualized after-tax operating income (including
interest income) divided by average operating capital. Operating capital is
defined as net assets (total assets less total liabilities) excluding debt. This
measure is not recognized under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures used by other companies.

APPENDIX B - 3M COMPANY
2016LONG-TERM INCENTIVE
PLAN
The Plans purpose is to enhance the
Companys ability to attract, retain and motivate persons who make (or are
expected to make) important contributions to the Company by providing these
individuals with equity ownership opportunities. The Plan succeeds the 3M 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Article I.
Definitions
As used in the Plan, the following
words and phrases will have the meanings specified below, unless the context
clearly indicates otherwise:
1.1 Administrator means the Board or a
Committee to the extent that the Boards powers or authority under the Plan have
been delegated to such Committee. With reference to the Boards or a Committees
powers or authority under the Plan that have been delegated to one or more
officers pursuant to Section 3.2, the term Administrator shall refer to such
person(s) unless and until such delegation has been revoked.
1.2 Applicable Law means any applicable
law, including without limitation: (a)
provisions of the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and any rules or regulations thereunder; (b) corporate, securities, tax or other
laws, statutes, rules, requirements or regulations, whether U.S. or non-U.S.
federal, state or local; and (c) rules of any securities exchange or automated
quotation system on which the Shares are listed, quoted or traded.
1.3 Award means an Option, Stock
Appreciation Right, Restricted Stock award, Restricted Stock Unit award,
Performance Bonus Award, Performance Share award or Other Stock or Cash Based
Award granted to a Participant under the Plan.

agreement evidencing an Award, which may be electronic, that contains such terms
and conditions as the Administrator determines, consistent with and subject to
the terms and conditions of the Plan.
1.5 Board means the Board of Directors of

1.6 Change in Control means the
occurrence of a change in control event, as defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) or such other regulation or guidance issued under

be exercised in its sole discretion, to determine conclusively whether a Change
in Control has occurred pursuant to the above definition, the date of the
occurrence of such Change in Control and any
incidental matters relating thereto; provided that any exercise of authority in
conjunction with a determination of whether a Change in Control is a change in
control event as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5) shall
be consistent with such regulation. Further and for the avoidance of doubt, a
transaction will not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose is to
(i) change the jurisdiction of the Companys incorporation, or (ii) create a
holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the
persons who held the Companys securities immediately before such
transaction.

directors or executive officers, to the extent Applicable Laws permit. To the
extent required to comply with the provisions of Rule 16b-3, it is intended that
each member of the Committee will be, at the time the Committee takes any action
with respect to an Award that is subject to Rule 16b-3, a non-employee
director within the meaning of Rule 16b-3; however, a Committee members
failure to qualify as a non-employee director within the meaning of Rule 16b-3
will not invalidate any Award granted by the Committee that is otherwise validly
granted under the Plan.
1.9 Common Stock means the common stock
of the Company.
1.10 Company means 3M Company, a Delaware
corporation, or any successor.
1.11 Designated Beneficiary means the
beneficiary or beneficiaries the Participant designates, in a manner the Company
permits and determines, to receive amounts due or exercise the Participants
rights if the Participant dies. Without a Participants effective designation,
Designated Beneficiary will mean the Participants estate or legal
heirs.

Common Stock (or other Company securities) and causes a change in the per share
value of the Common Stock underlying outstanding Awards.

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all regulations, guidance and other
interpretative authority issued thereunder.

date, the value of a Share determined as follows: (i) if the Common Stock is
listed on any established stock exchange, the value of a Share will be the
closing sales price for a Share as quoted on such exchange for such date, or if

reliable; (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed on an established stock
exchange but is quoted on a national market or other quotation system, the value

if the Common Stock is not listed on any established stock exchange or quoted on
a national market or other quotation system, the value of a Share will be
established by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
1.20 Full Value Award shall mean any Award
that is settled in Shares other than: (a) an Option, (b) a Stock Appreciation
Right or (c) any other Award for which the Participant pays the intrinsic value

respectively.
1.22 Incentive Stock Option means an
Option that meets the requirements to qualify as an incentive stock option as
defined in Section 422 of the Code.

could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) the Participants
conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of
unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving
moral turpitude; (D) the Participants commission of an act of fraud,
embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their officers,
directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (E) the
Participants material breach of any material provision of any written agreement
with the Company or any Subsidiary; or (F) any other intentional misconduct by
the Participant significantly affecting the business or affairs of the Company
or any Subsidiary in an adverse manner. The Committee shall have the authority
to determine conclusively whether a Participant has committed Misconduct
pursuant to the above definition, the date of the occurrence of such Misconduct
and any incidental matters relating thereto; provided, however, that the
Companys Chief Executive Officer may establish a committee of two or more
officers of the Company (at least one of whom shall be the Companys Chief
Executive Officer or Senior Vice President, Human Resources) to make any and all
such determinations with respect to any Participant who is not then, and was not
previously, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company. The foregoing definition shall not in any way preclude or restrict the
right of the Company or any Subsidiary to discharge or dismiss any Participant
or other person in the service of the Company or any Subsidiary for any other
acts or omissions, but such other acts or omissions shall not be deemed, for
purposes of the Plan, to constitute Misconduct.

Article IV. Stock Available for
Awards
4.1 Number of Shares. Subject to
adjustment under Article VIII and the terms of this Article IV, Awards may be made under
the Plan covering up to the Overall Share Limit. As of the Effective Date, the
Company will cease granting awards under the Prior Plans; however, Prior Plan
Awards will remain subject to the terms of the applicable Prior Plan. Shares
issued or delivered under the Plan may consist of authorized but unissued
Shares, Shares purchased on the open market or treasury Shares. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the aggregate number of Shares available for issuance under the
Plan shall be reduced by 2.5 Shares for each Share delivered in settlement of
any Full Value Award, and by one share for every one share granted that is
subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.
4.2 Share Recycling. If all or
any part of an Award or Prior Plan Award expires, lapses or is terminated,
exchanged for cash, surrendered, repurchased, canceled without having been fully
exercised or forfeited, in any case, in a manner that results in the Company
acquiring Shares covered by the Award or Prior Plan Award at a price not greater
than the price (as adjusted to reflect any Equity Restructuring) paid by the
Participant for such Shares or not issuing any Shares covered by the Award or
Prior Plan Award, the unused Shares covered by the Award or Prior Plan Award
will, as applicable, become or again be available for Awards under the Plan.
Further, Shares delivered (either by actual delivery or attestation) to the
Company by a Participant to satisfy the applicable exercise or purchase price of
an Award or Prior Plan Award and/or to satisfy any applicable tax withholding
obligation (including Shares retained by the Company from the Award or Prior
Plan Award being exercised or purchased and/or creating the tax obligation)
will, as applicable, become or again be available for Award grants under the
Plan. The payment of Dividend Equivalents in cash in conjunction with any
outstanding Awards or Prior Plan Awards shall not count against the Overall
Share Limit. Any Shares that again become available for Awards under the Plan
pursuant to this Section shall be added as (i) one Share for every one Share
subject to Options or Stock Appreciation Rights granted under the Plan or
options or stock appreciation rights granted under any Prior Plan, and (ii) as
2.5 Shares for every one Share subject to Full Value Awards granted under the
Plan or awards other than options or stock appreciation rights granted under any
Prior Plan.
4.3 Incentive Stock Option
Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no more than
34,000,000 Shares (as adjusted to reflect any Equity Restructuring) may be
issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options. 
4.4 Substitute Awards. In
connection with an entitys merger or consolidation with the Company or any
Subsidiary or the Companys or any Subsidiarys acquisition of an entitys property or
stock, the Administrator may grant Awards in substitution for any options or
other stock or stock-based awards granted before such merger or consolidation by
such entity or its affiliate. Substitute Awards may be granted on such terms and
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate, notwithstanding limitations
on Awards in the Plan. Substitute Awards will not count against the Overall
Share Limit (nor shall Shares subject to a Substitute Award be added to the
Shares available for Awards under the Plan as provided above), except that
Shares acquired by exercise of substitute Incentive Stock Options will count
against the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise
of Incentive Stock Options under the Plan. Additionally, in the event that a
company acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary or with which the Company or
any Subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved
by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or
combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such
pre-existing plan (as appropriately adjusted to reflect the transaction) may be
used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the Shares authorized for
grant under the Plan (and Shares subject to such Awards (which, for the
avoidance of doubt excludes Substitute Awards) may again become available for
Awards under the Plan as provided under Section 4.2 above); provided that Awards
using such available shares (or any Shares that again become available for
issuance under the Plan under Section 4.2 above) shall not be made after the
date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing
plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to
individuals who were not employees or directors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to such acquisition or combination.

4.5 Non-Employee Director
Compensation. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or
in any policy of the Company regarding non-employee Director compensation, the
Administrator may establish compensation for non-employee Directors from time to
time, subject to the limitations in the Plan. The Administrator will from time
to time determine the terms, conditions and amounts of all such non-employee
Director compensation in its sole discretion and pursuant to the exercise of its
business judgment, taking into account such
factors, circumstances and considerations as it shall deem relevant from time to
time, provided that the sum of any cash compensation, or other compensation, and
the value (determined as of the grant date in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, or any
successor thereto) of Awards granted to a non-employee Director as compensation
for services as a non-employee Director during any calendar year may not exceed
$600,000.
Article V. Stock Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights
5.1 General. The Administrator
may grant Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to one or more Service Providers,
subject to such terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the
Administrator shall determine. The Administrator will determine the number of
Shares covered by each Option and Stock Appreciation Right, the exercise price
of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right and the conditions and limitations
applicable to the exercise of each Option and Stock Appreciation Right. A Stock
Appreciation Right will entitle the Participant (or other person entitled to
exercise the Stock Appreciation Right) to receive from the Company upon exercise
of the exercisable portion of the Stock Appreciation Right an amount determined
by multiplying the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the
date of exercise over the exercise price per Share of the Stock Appreciation
Right by the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right
is exercised, subject to any limitations of the Plan or that the Administrator
may impose and payable in cash, Shares valued at Fair Market Value on the date
of exercise or a combination of the two as the Administrator may determine or
provide in the Award Agreement. 
5.2 Exercise Price. The
Administrator will establish each Options and Stock Appreciation Rights
exercise price and specify the exercise price in the Award Agreement. The
exercise price will not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value on the grant
date of the Option or Stock Appreciation Right. 
5.3 Duration of Options. Each
Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be exercisable at such times and as
specified in the Award Agreement, provided that the term of an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right will not exceed ten years. 
5.4 Exercise. 
(a) Exercise Procedure. Options and Stock
Appreciation Rights may be exercised by delivering to the Company a notice of
exercise, in a form and manner the Company approves (which may be electronic or
telephonic), signed or authenticated by the
person authorized to exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation Right, together
with, as applicable, payment in full of (i) the exercise price for the number of
Shares for which the Option is exercised in a manner specified in Section 5.5
and (ii) all applicable taxes in a manner specified in Section 9.5. 
(b) Limited
Automatic Exercise.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), unless
otherwise  determined in the Award Agreement, the vested and exercisable portion of an  Option or Stock Appreciation Right
that remains outstanding immediately prior to  the expiration of its full term (or, if applicable, the limited
post-termination  exercise window) shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Participant at  such time if (i) the
Participant has accepted the Option or Stock Appreciation  Right, (ii) the Fair Market Value of one Share exceeds the
applicable exercise  price per Share, and (iii) either (A) such
Option or Stock Appreciation Right remains  outstanding on the last day of its full term or (B) the Participants Option
or  Stock Appreciation Right otherwise would terminate prior to the last day of its  full term as a result of the
Participants death. For the avoidance of doubt, an  Option or Stock Appreciation Right that terminates upon the
expiration of its  limited post-termination exercise window shall not be deemed to have remained  outstanding on the last day
of its full term for purposes of clause (iii) in the  preceding sentence. In the event an Option or Stock Appreciation Right
is  exercised pursuant to this Section 5.4(b), the Company shall deliver to the  Participant the number of Shares for which
the Option or Stock Appreciation  Right was deemed exercised, less the number of Shares required to be withheld  for the
payment of the total purchase price and required withholding taxes.  Unless the Company otherwise determines, an Option or
Stock Appreciation Right  may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
5.5 Payment Upon Exercise. The
Administrator shall determine the methods (or combination of methods) by which
payment of the exercise price of an Option shall be made, including, without
limitation: 
98  |  3M


Table of Contents
(a) cash, check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds; provided that the Company may limit the use of one
of the foregoing methods if one or more of the methods below is
permitted;
(b) if there is a public market for
Shares at the time of exercise, unless the Company otherwise determines, (A)
delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of a
notice that the Participant has placed a market sell order with a broker
acceptable to the Company with respect to Shares then issuable upon exercise of
the Option and that the broker has been directed to deliver promptly to the
Company funds sufficient to pay the exercise price, or (B) the Participants
delivery to the Company of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions
to a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company an
amount sufficient to pay the exercise price by cash, check or wire transfer of
immediately available funds; provided that such amount is paid to the Company at
such time as may be required by the Company;
(c) to the extent permitted by the
Administrator, delivery (either by actual delivery or attestation) of Shares
owned by the Participant valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of
delivery (or such other date determined by the Administrator);
(d) to the extent permitted by the
Administrator, surrendering Shares then issuable upon the Options exercise
valued at their Fair Market Value on the exercise date; or
(e) to the extent permitted by the
Administrator, delivery of a promissory note or any other lawful
consideration.
5.6 Additional Terms of Incentive Stock Options.
The Administrator may grant Incentive Stock Options only to employees of the Company, any of its present or future parent or subsidiary
corporations, as defined in Sections 424(e) or (f) of the Code, respectively, and any other entities the employees of which are
eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options under the Code. If an Incentive Stock Option is granted to a Greater Than 10% Stockholder,
the exercise price will not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value on the Options grant date, and the term of the Option
will not exceed five years. All Incentive Stock Options will be subject to and construed consistently with Section 422 of the
Code. By accepting an Incentive Stock Option, the Participant agrees to give prompt notice to the Company of dispositions or other
transfers (other than in connection with a Change in Control) of Shares acquired under the Option made within (i) two years from
the grant date of the Option or (ii) one year after the transfer of such Shares to the Participant, specifying the date of the
disposition or other transfer and the amount the Participant realized, in cash, other property, assumption of indebtedness or
other consideration, in such disposition or other transfer. Neither the Company nor the Administrator will be liable to a Participant,
or any other party, if an Incentive Stock Option fails or ceases to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section
422 of the Code. Any Incentive Stock Option or portion thereof that fails to qualify as an incentive stock option
under Section 422 of the Code for any reason, including becoming exercisable with respect to Shares having a fair market value
exceeding the $100,000 limitation under Treasury Regulation Section 1.422-4, will be a Nonqualified Stock Option.
Article VI. Restricted Stock;
Restricted Stock Units
6.1 General. The Administrator
may grant Restricted Stock, or the right to purchase Restricted Stock, to any
Service Provider, subject to forfeiture or the Companys right to repurchase all
or part of such shares at their issue price or other stated or formula price
from the Participant if conditions the Administrator specifies in the Award
Agreement are not satisfied before the end of the applicable restriction period
or periods that the Administrator establishes for such Award. In addition, the
Administrator may grant to Service Providers Restricted Stock Units, which may
be subject to vesting and forfeiture conditions during the applicable
restriction period or periods, as set forth in an Award Agreement. The Award
Agreement for each Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Award shall set
forth the terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the
Administrator shall determine. 
6.2 Restricted Stock.
(a) Dividends. Subject to any limitations
approved by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement, Participants
holding shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to all ordinary cash
dividends paid with respect to such Shares. In addition, unless the
Administrator provides otherwise and subject to the provisions of this Section
6.2(a) below, if any dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, or consist
of a dividend or distribution to holders of Common Stock of cash or property
other than an ordinary cash dividend, the Shares or other cash or property will
be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the
shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, dividends with respect to an Award of
Restricted Stock
2016 Proxy Statement  |  99


Table of Contents
with performance-based vesting shall be
accumulated and subject to vesting to the same extent as the related shares of
Restricted Stock. All such dividends shall be paid as soon as administratively
practicable following the time the applicable Restricted Stock vests and becomes
non-forfeitable or such later time as may be set forth in the Award
Agreement.
(b) Stock Certificates. The Company may
require that the Participant deposit in escrow with the Company (or its
designee) any stock certificates issued in respect of shares of Restricted
Stock, together with a stock power endorsed in blank.
6.3 Restricted Stock Units. The
Administrator may provide that settlement of Restricted Stock Units will occur
upon or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Restricted Stock Units vest
or will instead be deferred, on a mandatory basis or at the Participants
election.
Article VII. Other Types of
Awards
7.1 General. The Administrator

Equivalents or Other Stock or Cash Based Awards, to one or more Service
Providers, in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as the Administrator shall determine.
7.2 Performance Share Awards.
Each Performance Share award shall be denominated in a number of Shares or in
unit equivalents of Shares and/or units of value (including a dollar value of
Shares) and may be linked to any one or more of the Performance Criteria or
other specific criteria, including service to the Company or Subsidiaries,
determined to be appropriate by the Administrator, in each case on a specified
date or dates or over any Performance Period. In making such determinations, the
Administrator may consider (among such other factors as it deems relevant in
light of the specific type of Award) the contributions, responsibilities and
other compensation of the particular Participant.
7.3 Performance Bonus Awards.
Each right to receive a bonus granted under this Section 7.3 shall be
denominated in the form of cash and shall be initially payable in cash (but may,
in the discretion of the Administrator, be payable in Shares or a combination of
cash and Shares) (a Performance Bonus
Award) and shall be payable upon the
attainment of performance goals that are established by the Administrator and
relate to one or more of the Performance Criteria or other specific criteria,
including service to the Company or Subsidiaries, in each case on a specified
date or dates or over any Performance Period.
7.4 Dividend Equivalents. If the
Administrator provides, an Award (other than an Option or Stock Appreciation
Right) may provide a Participant with the right to receive Dividend Equivalents. Dividend Equivalents may be paid
currently or credited to an account for the Participant, settled in cash or
Shares and subject to the same restrictions on transferability and
forfeitability as the Award with respect to which the Dividend Equivalents are
granted and subject to other terms and conditions as set forth in the Award
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Dividend Equivalents
with respect to an Award with performance-based vesting shall either (i) to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, not be paid or credited or (ii) be
accumulated and subject to vesting to the same extent as the related Award. All
such Dividend Equivalents shall be paid at such time as the Administrator shall
specify in the applicable Award Agreement.
7.5 Other Stock or Cash Based
Awards. Other Stock or Cash Based Awards may be granted to Participants,
including Awards entitling Participants to receive Shares to be delivered in the
future and including annual or other periodic or long-term cash bonus awards
(whether based on specified Performance Criteria or otherwise), in each case
subject to any conditions and limitations in the Plan. Such Other Stock or Cash
Based Awards will also be available as a payment form in the settlement of other
Awards, as standalone payments and as payment in lieu of compensation to which a
Participant is otherwise entitled. Other Stock or Cash Based Awards may be paid
in Shares, cash or other property, as the Administrator determines. Subject to
the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator will determine the terms and
conditions of each Other Stock or Cash Based Award, including any purchase
price, performance goal (which may be based on the Performance Criteria),
transfer restrictions, and vesting conditions, which will be set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement.

reasonable period of time after such change) and either automatically or upon

8.3 Administrative Stand Still.
In the event of any pending stock dividend, stock split, combination or exchange
of shares, merger, consolidation or other distribution (other than normal cash
dividends) of Company assets to stockholders, or any other extraordinary
transaction or change affecting the Shares or the share price of Common Stock
(including any Equity Restructuring or any securities offering or other similar
transaction) or for reasons of administrative convenience or to facilitate
compliance with any Applicable Laws, the Company may refuse to permit the

Participant will have any rights due to any subdivision or consolidation of
Shares of any class, dividend payment, increase or decrease in the number of
Shares of any class or dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation of
the Company or other corporation. Except as
expressly provided with respect to an Equity Restructuring under Section 8.1

of Shares of any class, or securities convertible into Shares of any class, will
affect, and no adjustment will be made regarding, the number of Shares subject
to an Award or the Awards grant or exercise price. The existence of the Plan,
any Award Agreements and the Awards granted hereunder will not affect or
restrict in any way the Companys right or power to make or authorize (i) any
adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Companys
capital structure or its business, (ii) any merger, consolidation, spinoff,
dissolution or liquidation of the Company or sale of Company assets or (iii) any
sale or issuance of securities, including securities with rights superior to
those of the Shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Shares.
The Administrator may treat Participants and Awards (or portions thereof)
differently under this Article VIII. 
Article IX. Provisions Applicable to
Awards
9.1 Transferability. Except as
the Administrator may determine or provide in an Award Agreement or otherwise
for Awards other than Incentive Stock Options, Awards may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, either voluntarily or by operation
of law, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or, subject to
the Administrators consent, pursuant to a domestic relations order, and, during
the life of the Participant, will be exercisable only by the Participant.
References to a Participant, to the extent relevant in the context, will include
references to a transferee approved by the Administrator.
9.2 Documentation. Each Award
will be evidenced in an Award Agreement, which may be written or electronic, as
the Administrator determines. Each Award may contain such terms and conditions
as are not inconsistent with those set forth in the Plan. 
9.3 Discretion. Except as the
Plan otherwise provides, each Award may be made alone or in addition or in
relation to any other Award. The terms of each Award to a Participant need not
be identical, and the Administrator need not treat Participants or Awards (or
portions thereof) uniformly. 
9.4 Changes in Participants
Status. The Company will determine how the disability, death, retirement,
authorized leave of absence or any other change or purported change in a
Participants Service Provider status affects an Award and the extent to which,
and the period during which, the Participant, the Participants legal
representative, conservator, guardian or Designated Beneficiary may exercise
rights under the Award, if applicable. Except to the extent otherwise required
by Applicable Law or expressly authorized by the Company or by the Companys
written policy on leaves of absence, no service credit shall be given for
vesting purposes for any period the Participant is on a leave of absence.

9.5 Withholding. Each
Participant must pay the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the
Administrator for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld in
connection with such Participants Awards by the date of the event creating the
tax liability. The Company may deduct an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax
obligations based on the minimum statutory withholding rates (or such other rate
as may be determined by the Company after considering any accounting
consequences or costs) from any payment of any kind otherwise due to a
Participant. Subject to any Company insider trading policy (including blackout
periods) and the 
102  |  3M

Contents
terms of the applicable Award
Agreement, Participants may satisfy such tax obligations (i) in cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, by check made payable to the order of
the Company; provided that the Company may limit the use of one of the foregoing
methods if one or more of the exercise methods below is permitted, (ii) to the
extent permitted by the Administrator, in whole or in part by delivery of
Shares, including Shares delivered by attestation and Shares retained from the
Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date
of delivery (or such other date determined by the Administrator), (iii) if there
is a public market for Shares at the time the tax obligations are satisfied,
unless the Company otherwise determines, (A) delivery (including telephonically
to the extent permitted by the Company) of a notice that the Participant has
placed a market sell order with a broker acceptable to the Company with respect
to Shares then issuable upon exercise of the Award and that the broker has been
directed to deliver promptly to the Company funds sufficient to satisfy the tax
obligations, or (B) the Participants delivery to the Company of a copy of
irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the Company
to deliver promptly to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy the tax
withholding by cash, check or wire transfer of immediately available funds;
provided that such amount is paid to the Company at such time as may be required
by the Company, (iv) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, delivery of a
promissory note or any other lawful consideration or (v) any combination of the
foregoing payment forms approved by the Administrator. If any tax withholding
obligation will be satisfied under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence by the Companys retention of Shares from the Award creating the tax
obligation and there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax
obligation is satisfied, the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm
determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on the applicable
Participants behalf some or all of the Shares retained and to remit the
proceeds of the sale to the Company or its designee, and each Participants
acceptance of an Award under the Plan will constitute the Participants
authorization to the Company and instruction and authorization to such brokerage
firm to complete the transactions described in this sentence. 
9.6 Amendment of Award; Prohibition
on Repricing. The Administrator may amend, modify or terminate any
outstanding Award, including by substituting another Award of the same or a
different type, changing the exercise or settlement date, converting an
Incentive Stock Option to a Nonqualified Stock Option and providing for cash
settlement of an outstanding award. The Participants consent to such action
will be required unless (i) the action, taking into account any related action,
does not materially and adversely affect the
economic benefits to be delivered under the Award as of the date of such
amendment, modification or termination, or (ii) the change is permitted under
Article VIII or pursuant to Sections 10.5 or 10.6. Other than pursuant to
Sections 8.1 and 8.2, the Administrator shall not without the approval of the
Companys stockholders (a) lower the exercise price per Share of an Option or
Stock Appreciation Right after it is granted, (b) cancel an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right when the exercise price per Share exceeds the Fair Market
Value of one Share in exchange for cash or another Award, or (c) take any other
action with respect to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right that the Company
determines would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of
the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the Shares are
listed.
9.7 Conditions on Delivery of
Stock. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Shares under the
Plan or remove restrictions from Shares previously delivered under the Plan
until (i) all
Award conditions have been met or removed to the Companys satisfaction, (ii) as
determined by the Company, all other legal matters regarding the issuance and
delivery of such Shares have been satisfied, including any applicable securities
laws and stock exchange or stock market rules and regulations, (iii) any approvals from
governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable
have been obtained, and (iv) the Participant has executed and delivered to the Company such
representations or agreements as the Company deems necessary or appropriate to
satisfy any Applicable Laws. The inability or impracticability of the Company to
obtain or maintain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which
authority is deemed by the Companys counsel to be necessary to the lawful
issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any
liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which
such requisite authority shall not have been obtained, and shall constitute
circumstances in which the Administrator may determine to amend or cancel Awards
pertaining to such Shares, with or without consideration to the
Participant.
9.8 Acceleration. The
Administrator may at any time provide that any Award will become immediately
vested and fully or partially exercisable, free of some or all restrictions or
conditions, or otherwise fully or partially realizable. 
9.9 Fractional Shares. No
fractional shares of Stock shall be issued and the Company shall determine, in
its sole and absolute discretion, whether cash shall be given in lieu of
fractional shares or whether such fractional shares shall be eliminated by
rounding down.

Article X. Miscellaneous
10.1 No Right to Employment or Other
Status. No person will have any claim or right to be granted an Award, and
the grant of an Award will not be construed as giving a Participant the right to
continue employment or any other relationship with the Company or a Subsidiary.
The Company and its Subsidiaries expressly reserve the right at any time to
dismiss or otherwise terminate their relationship with a Participant free from
any liability or claim under the Plan or any Award, except as expressly provided
in an Award Agreement.
10.2 No Rights as Stockholder;
Certificates. Subject to the Award Agreement, no Participant or Designated
Beneficiary will have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares to
be distributed under an Award until becoming the record holder of such Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless the Company otherwise
determines or Applicable Laws require, the Company will not be required to
deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing Shares issued in connection
with any Award and instead such Shares may be recorded in the books of the
Company (or, as applicable, its transfer agent or stock plan administrator). The
Company may place legends on any share certificate or book entry to reference
restrictions applicable to the Shares (including, without limitation,
restrictions applicable to Restricted Stock).
10.3 Effective Date and Term of
Plan. The Plan will become effective on the date it is approved by the
Companys stockholders (the Effective
Date). The Plan will expire on, and no Award
may be granted pursuant to the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective
Date, but Awards previously granted may extend beyond that date and shall remain
in force according to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement.
If the Plan is not approved by the Companys stockholders, the Plan will not
become effective, no Awards will be granted under the Plan and the Prior Plans
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.
10.4 Amendment of Plan. The
Board or the Compensation Committee of the Board may amend, suspend or terminate
the Plan at any time and from time to time; provided that (a) no amendment
requiring stockholder approval to comply with Applicable Laws shall be effective
unless approved by the Board and the Companys stockholders, and (b) no
amendment, other than an increase to the Overall Share Limit, may materially and
adversely affect the economic benefits to be delivered under any outstanding
award as of the date of such amendment without the affected Participants
consent. No Awards may be granted under the Plan during any suspension period or after Plan termination. Awards
outstanding at the time of any Plan suspension or termination will continue to
be governed by the Plan and the Award Agreement, as in effect before such
suspension or termination. The Board will obtain stockholder approval of any
Plan amendment to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable
Laws.
10.5 Provisions for Foreign
Participants. The Administrator may modify Awards granted to Participants
who are foreign nationals employed or residing outside the United States or
establish subplans or procedures under the Plan to address differences in laws,
rules, regulations or customs of such foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax,
securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters.
10.6 Section 409A.

(a) General. The Company intends that all
Awards be structured to comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A, such that no adverse
tax consequences, interest, or penalties under Section 409A apply. Notwithstanding anything in
the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Administrator may, without
a Participants consent, amend the Plan or Awards, adopt policies and
procedures, or take any other actions (including amendments, policies,
procedures and retroactive actions) as are necessary or appropriate to preserve
the intended tax treatment of Awards, including any such actions intended to
(A) exempt the
Plan or any Award from Section 409A, or (B) comply with Section 409A, including regulations, guidance,
compliance programs and other interpretative authority that may be issued after
an Awards grant date. The Company makes no representations or warranties as to
an Awards tax treatment under Section 409A or otherwise. The Company will have no
obligation under this Section 10.6 or otherwise to avoid the taxes, penalties or
interest under Section 409A with respect to any Award and will have no liability to any
Participant or any other person if any Award, compensation or other benefits
under the Plan are determined to constitute noncompliant nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to taxes, penalties or interest under Section 409A.
(b) Separation from Service. If an Award
constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A, any payment or
settlement of such Award upon a Participants Termination of Service will, to
the extent necessary to avoid taxes under Section 409A, be made only upon the Participants
separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A), whether 
104  |  3M


Table of
Contents
such separation from service occurs
upon or after the Participants Termination of Service. For purposes of the Plan
or any Award Agreement relating to any such payments or benefits, references to
a termination, termination of employment or like terms mean a separation
from service. 
(c) Payments to Specified Employees.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the Plan or any Award Agreement, any
payment(s) of nonqualified deferred compensation required to be made under an
Award to a specified employee (as defined under Section 409A and as the Company determines) due
to his or her separation from service will, to the extent necessary to avoid
taxes under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) (i) of the Code, be delayed for the six-month period
immediately following such separation from service (or, if earlier, until the
specified employees death) and will instead be paid (as set forth in the Award
Agreement) on the day immediately following such six-month period or as soon as
administratively practicable thereafter (without interest). Any payments of
nonqualified deferred compensation under such Award payable more than six
months following the Participants separation from service will be paid at the
time or times the payments are otherwise scheduled to be made.
10.7 Limitations Applicable to
Section 16 Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the
Plan and any Award granted or awarded to any Participant who is then subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be subject to any additional limitations
set forth in any applicable exemptive rule under Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(including any amendment to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any successor
rule) that are requirements for the application of such exemptive rule. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Plan and Awards granted or awarded
hereunder shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such
applicable exemptive rule.
10.8 Limitations on Liability.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no individual acting as a
director, officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary will be liable to
any Participant, former Participant, spouse, beneficiary, or any other person
for any claim, loss, liability, or expense incurred in connection with the Plan
or any Award, and such individual will not be personally liable with respect to
the Plan because of any contract or other instrument executed in his or her
capacity as an Administrator, director, officer or other employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary. The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each director,
officer or other employee of the Company or any Subsidiary that has been or will
be granted or delegated any duty or power relating to the Plans administration
or interpretation, against any cost or expense (including attorneys fees) or
liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the Companys
approval) arising from any act or omission
concerning the Plan unless arising from such persons own fraud or bad faith;
provided that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to
handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it
on his or her own behalf.
10.9 Data Privacy. As a
condition for receiving any Award, each Participant explicitly and unambiguously
consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of
personal data as described in this Section by and among the Company and its
Subsidiaries and affiliates exclusively for implementing, administering and
managing the Participants participation in the Plan. The Company and its
Subsidiaries and affiliates may hold certain personal information about a
Participant, including the Participants name, address and telephone number;
birthdate; social security, insurance number or other identification number;
salary; nationality; job title(s); any Shares held in the Company or its
Subsidiaries and affiliates; and Award details (the Data), to implement, manage and
administer the Plan and Awards. The Company and its Subsidiaries and affiliates
may transfer the Data amongst themselves as necessary to implement, administer
and manage a Participants participation in the Plan, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer the Data to third parties assisting the
Company with Plan implementation, administration and management. These
recipients may be located in the Participants country, or elsewhere, and the
Participants country may have different data privacy laws and protections than
the recipients country. By accepting an Award, each Participant authorizes such
recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic
or other form, to implement, administer and manage the Participants
participation in the Plan, including any required Data transfer to a broker or
other third party with whom the Company or the Participant may elect to deposit
any Shares. The Company may cancel Participants ability to participate in the
Plan and, in the Companys sole discretion, the Participant may forfeit any
outstanding Awards if the Participant refuses or withdraws the consents in this
Section 10.9.
10.10 Severability. If any
portion of the Plan or any action taken under it is held illegal or invalid for
any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of
the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as if the illegal or
invalid provisions had been excluded, and the illegal or invalid action will be
null and void.
10.11 Governing Documents. If
any contradiction occurs between the Plan and any Award Agreement or other
written agreement between a Participant and the Company (or any Subsidiary), the
Plan will govern, unless such Award Agreement or other written agreement was
approved by the Administrator and expressly provides that a specific provision
of the Plan will not apply.
2016 Proxy
Statement  |  105


Table of
Contents
10.12 Governing Law. The Plan
and all Awards will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws
of the State of Delaware, disregarding the choice-of-law principles of the State
of Delaware and any other state requiring the application of a jurisdictions
laws other than the State of Delaware.
10.13 Clawback Provisions. All
Awards (including the gross amount of any proceeds, gains or other economic
benefit the Participant actually or constructively receives upon receipt or
exercise of any Award or the receipt or resale of any Shares underlying the
Award) will be subject to recoupment by the Company to the extent required to
comply with Applicable Laws or any policy of the Company providing for the
reimbursement of incentive compensation.
10.14 Titles and Headings. The
titles and headings in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, if
any conflict, the Plans text, rather than such titles or headings, will
control.
10.15 Conformity to Applicable
Laws. Participant acknowledges that the Plan is intended to conform to the
extent necessary with Applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Plan and all Awards will be administered only in a manner intended
to conform with Applicable Laws. To the extent Applicable Laws permit, the Plan
and all Award Agreements will be deemed amended as necessary to conform to
Applicable Laws. 
10.16 Relationship to Other
Benefits. No payment under the Plan will be taken into account in
determining any benefits under any pension, retirement, savings, profit sharing,
group insurance, welfare or other benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary,
except as expressly provided in writing in such other plan or an agreement
thereunder.
10.17 Broker-Assisted Sales. In
the event of a broker-assisted sale of Shares in connection with the payment of
amounts owed by a Participant under or with respect to the Plan or Awards,
including amounts to be paid under the final sentence of Section 9.5: (a) any
Shares to be sold through the broker-assisted sale will be sold on the day the
payment first becomes due, or as soon thereafter as practicable; (b) such Shares
may be sold as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan in
which all participants receive an average price; (c) the applicable Participant
will be responsible for all brokers fees and other costs of sale, and by
accepting an Award, each Participant agrees to indemnify and hold the Company
harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or expenses relating to any such sale;
(d) to the extent the Company or its designee receives proceeds of such sale
that exceed the amount owed, the Company will pay
such excess in cash to the applicable Participant as soon as reasonably
practicable; (e) the Company and its designees are under no obligation to
arrange for such sale at any particular price; and (f) in the event the proceeds
of such sale are insufficient to satisfy the Participants applicable
obligation, the Participant may be required to pay immediately upon demand to
the Company or its designee an amount in cash sufficient to satisfy any
remaining portion of the Participants obligation.
10.18 Section 162(m)
Limitations.
(a) Individual Award Limitations. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, and subject to
adjustment as provided in Article VIII, (i) the maximum aggregate number of
Shares with respect to all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that may be
granted to any one person during any calendar year shall be 500,000; (ii) the
maximum aggregate number of Shares that may be earned with respect to all Awards
of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares and Other Stock
or Cash Based Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based
Compensation and are denominated in Shares that may be granted to any one person
during any calendar year shall be 500,000; and (iii) the maximum aggregate
amount that may become payable (in cash, Shares or any combination thereof)
pursuant to all Performance Bonus Awards that may be granted to any one person
during any calendar year shall be U.S. $10,000,000; provided, however, that in no event will more
than the Overall Share Limit be granted to any one person during any calendar
year of the Company with respect to one or more Award denominated in Shares. To
the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code, Shares subject to Awards that
are canceled shall continue to be counted against the award limits above. For
purposes of this Section 10.18(a), each Share subject to an Award (including a
Full Value Award) shall be counted as one Share against the specified limit.
Each of the limitations in this Section, other than the Overall Share Limit,
shall be multiplied by two (2) with respect to Awards granted to a Participant
during the calendar year in which the Participant commences employment with the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries. 
(b) Committee Composition. To the extent
an Award is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the
Administrator with respect to such Awards shall be a Committee comprised solely
of two or more Directors, each of whom is intended to be an outside director
within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code; provided that a Committee
members failure to qualify as an outside director within the meaning of
Section 162(m) will not invalidate any Award granted by the Committee that is
otherwise validly granted under the Plan. 
106  |  3M


Table of
Contents
(c) Performance-Based Compensation.
The Administrator, in its sole discretion,
may determine at the time an Award is granted or at any time thereafter whether
such Award is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Administrator to structure
any Awards in a manner intended to constitute Performance-Based Compensation and
the Administrator shall be free, in its sole discretion, to grant Awards that
are not intended to be Performance-Based Compensation. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Plan and except as otherwise determined by the Administrator,
any Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be
subject to any additional limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code that are
requirements for qualification as Performance-Based Compensation, and the Plan
and the applicable Award Agreement shall be deemed amended to the extent
necessary to conform to such requirements. In addition, Awards of Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares, Performance Bonus Awards and
Other Stock or Cash Based Awards that are intended to qualify as
Performance-Based Compensation shall be subject to the following provisions,
which shall control over any conflicting provision in the Plan or any Award
Agreement: 
(i) To the extent necessary to comply
with the requirements of Section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, no later than 90 days
following the commencement of any performance period or any designated fiscal
period or period of service (or such earlier time as may be required under
Section 162(m) of the Code), the Administrator shall, in writing, (a) designate
the Participant to receive such Award, (b) select the Performance Criteria
applicable to the performance period, which Performance Criteria shall be
limited to the specific performance goals set forth in the definition of
Performance Criteria, (c) establish the performance goals (and any exclusions), and
amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may
be earned for such performance period based on the Performance Criteria, and
(d) specify the
relationship between Performance Criteria and the performance goals and the
amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Participant for such
performance period.
(ii) Following the completion of each
performance period, the Administrator shall certify in writing whether and the
extent to which the applicable performance goals have been achieved for such
performance period. In determining the amount earned under such Awards, the
Administrator shall have the right to reduce or eliminate (but not to increase)
the amount payable at a given level of performance to take into account
additional factors that the Administrator may deem relevant, including the
assessment of individual or corporate performance for the performance period.

(iii) Unless otherwise specified by the
Administrator at the time of grant, the Performance Criteria with respect to an Award
intended to be Performance-Based Compensation payable to a Participant shall be
determined on the basis of Applicable Accounting Standards. For this purpose,
Applicable Accounting
Standards means the U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, International Financial Reporting Standards or other
accounting principles or standards applicable to the Companys financial
statements under U.S. federal securities laws.
(iv) No adjustment or action described
in Article VIII or in any other provision of the Plan shall be authorized to the
extent that such adjustment or action would cause such Award to fail to so
qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, unless the Administrator determines
that the Award should not so qualify.
