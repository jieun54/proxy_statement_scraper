  ACHIEVING LEADING RETURNS









In 2017, Abbott achieved outstanding returns to shareholders, ranking #1 in our peer group. Abbott's one-year total shareholder return (TSR) was
52.0%, which was 30.2 and 23.9 percentage points above the robust growth of both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),
respectively. Abbott continues to be recognized as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, having increased the dividend payout for 46 consecutive years. 



 
  




  WELL-POSITIONED FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH



 
In 2017, Abbott continued to strategically shape its business through the additions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc. The St. Jude
Medical business expands Abbott's presence into multiple new areas of cardiovascular care, as well as neuromodulation, transforming Abbott into a broad-based leader in medical devices.
Alere Inc. extends Abbott's long-established presence and leadership in diagnostics into rapid testing, an attractive and high growth area of testing in both developed and emerging markets. In
addition, Abbott continues to have a strong organic pipeline of innovative new products across each of our major businesses, including novel technologies for glucose-monitoring, neuromodulation,
cardiovascular care and fully-integrated diagnostic testing solutions. Together, this high level of R&D productivity and strategic shaping gives Abbott an exciting portfolio of businesses with the
presence and capabilities in both developed and emerging markets to create new market opportunities for long-term growth.

  STAYING CURRENT AND RELEVANT - 130 YEARS LATER









Abbott is celebrating an important milestone in 2018: the company's 130th anniversary. A key element of our
longevity and success has been the ability to adapt and change continually to ensure Abbott remains current and relevant. Today, Abbott operates a diverse and balanced portfolio of businesses that are
all leaders in large, attractive markets and aligned with favorable, long-term healthcare trends. The strategic actions we've taken over the last several years have created leading positions in the
segments of healthcare where we compete. 



























 ​
 






 











 MEDICAL DEVICES



  Leading positions in cardiovascular, neuromodulation and diabetes care. In cardiovascular devices, Abbott holds
 #1 or #2 positions across several large market segments, including coronary stents, cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.
 








 
 




 
 






 











 DIAGNOSTICS



  A global leader in in vitro diagnostics offering a broad
 portfolio spanning immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, blood screening, molecular and point of care diagnostics.
 








 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 






 ​
 







 











 NUTRITION



   Portfolio of science-based products addressing the unique nutrition needs for people of all ages. Abbott is the worldwide
 leader in Adult nutrition and the leading Pediatric nutrition company in the United States.
 









 
 




 
 






 











 ESTABLISHED PHARMACEUTICALS



   High-quality, branded generic pharmaceuticals business that is focused on emerging geographies, with significant scale and leading positions in India, Russia and Latin America.
 








 




  
 
     






  PEER GROUP









Our
shareholders compare us to other global multinational companies, only some of which are in healthcare. These companies share similar investment identities and operating
characteristics aligned with diversified growth, returns to shareholders, and capital structure. 
The
peer group used for performance and compensation benchmarking prior to 2017 was established at the time of the AbbVie separation in 2013. That group has been used without change from 2013 through
2016. Due to the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc. and significant changes in several peers due to corporate transactions, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and
its consultant reviewed the peer group to be used for 2017 benchmarking. Based on that review, the Committee approved an update to the peer group to better align to our current size, scope, and global
footprint. 
In
determining changes to our peer group for 2017 performance and compensation benchmarking, as in prior years, we considered:


 Globally diverse manufacturing-driven organizations with significant international operations 
 Consumer-facing organizations 
 Similar financial and operating measures, including market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees  
 Similar return of cash profiles, including dividends and share repurchases 
 Similar geographic mix of revenues and profits

  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION









Over the past four years, we have averaged 95% shareholder support for our annual advisory vote on "Say on Pay", demonstrating strong support for our approach
to executive compensation. Our compensation program provides an appropriate and competitive mix of elements to incentivize our executives to achieve the Company's business
strategies and goals, while also aligning executive performance and awards with shareholder interests. 
 
  




  COMPENSATION ALIGNED WITH PERFORMANCE



 
The vast majority of compensation for our executive officers is performance-based and objectively determined. Long Term Incentives (LTI), which comprise the
largest percentage of compensation for our executive officers, are directly linked to shareholder returns. Each year, LTI award guidelines are determined based on relative TSR performance compared to
our peer group. The Compensation Committee looks at 1-, 3-, and 5-year TSR in making these determinations. The table below illustrates the relative TSR and award guidelines since 2013 for executive
officers at Abbott.

Not
only is a direct link evident in these results; it can reasonably be concluded that Abbott has been conservative in setting target payout levels. This linkage translates into significant
differentiation of pay for our executives, aligned with returns to our shareholders. The table below illustrates the pay outcomes for our CEO based on results each year since the separation of AbbVie.
Again, a direct pay for performance link is very evident.

  INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING



 
 
  




  WHO CAN VOTE



 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2018 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of
January 31, 2018, Abbott had 1,746,333,892 outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of
directors and one vote per share on all other matters. 
 
  




  NOTICE AND ACCESS



 
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Notice and Access" rules, Abbott mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the
"Notice") to certain shareholders in mid-March of 2018. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how the shareholders can access the proxy materials online. It also
provides instructions on how those shareholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a print version of the proxy materials, unless you request one. If you would
like to receive a print version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
 
  




  CUMULATIVE VOTING



 
Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee
or distribute the votes among the nominees, as the shareholder desires. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes against a nominee. If shares are voted cumulatively and there are more nominees than
there are director vacancies, nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
 
  




  VOTING BY PROXY



 
All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. Abbott's By-Laws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as
proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return
your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found with your proxy card or on the Notice. 
 
  




  REVOKING A PROXY



 
You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting:


 by delivering a written notice to the Secretary of Abbott, 
 by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
 by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 

 
  




  DISCRETIONARY VOTING AUTHORITY



 
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they
receive to elect the 12 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the Board of
Directors, or for fewer than 12 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares
cumulatively in their sole discretion so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. The
proxy holders may not cast your vote for any nominee from whom you have withheld authority to vote. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive
compensation, or the approval of a shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where
no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, and AGAINST the shareholder
proposal.

Table of Contents
The
Board of Directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted
in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
 
  




  QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH ITEM ON THE PROXY



 
A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at
the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
 
  




  EFFECT OF WITHHOLD VOTES, BROKER NON-VOTES, AND ABSTENTIONS



 
Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to withhold authority to vote for one or more
directors or to abstain from voting on another matter will have the effect of votes against those directors or that matter. A proxy submitted by an institution, such as a broker or bank that holds
shares for the account of a beneficial owner, may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for
example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not
present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority
to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary
authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, and shareholder proposals are
"non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. 
 
  




  INSPECTORS OF ELECTION



 
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott
employees. 
 
  




  COST OF SOLICITING PROXIES



 
Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
  




  ABBOTT LABORATORIES STOCK RETIREMENT PLAN



 
Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive voting instructions for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock
Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust is administered by both a trustee and an Investment Committee. The trustee of the Trust is The Northern Trust Company. The members of the Investment
Committee are Stephen R. Fussell, Karen M. Peterson, and Brian P. Wentworth, employees of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the Investment Committee and
the participants. The Investment Committee must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The Investment Committee may use its own discretion
with respect to those shares for which no voting instructions are received.

  CONFIDENTIAL VOTING



 
It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be
disclosed, except:


 where disclosure may be required by law or regulation, 
 where disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims, 
 where a shareholder provides comments with a proxy, 
 where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, 
 to allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or 
 in other limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the Board of Directors. 

 
  




  HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS



 
Shareholders sharing an address may receive only one copy of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, unless their
broker, bank, or other intermediary has received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This is known as "householding." Shareholders wishing to discontinue householding and
receive separate copies of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials should notify their broker, bank, or other intermediary.

  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES



 
  
 
     




THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS









The
Board of Directors held 7 meetings in 2017. The average attendance of all directors at Board and committee meetings in 2017 was ninety-nine percent and each director attended at
least seventy-five percent of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. Abbott encourages its Board members to attend the annual shareholders
meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The
Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern, R. S. Austin, S. E. Blount, W. J. Farrell,
E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry,
P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn, S. C. Scott III, D. J. Starks, J. G. Stratton, and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the Board applied the categorical standards attached as Exhibit A to
this proxy statement. The Board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship
that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which Abbott sold products or
made contributions or from which Abbott purchased products and services during the year. In making its determination, the Board relied on both information provided by the directors and information
developed internally by Abbott. 
The
Board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. 
  
 
     




LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE









The
Board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by one individual and an independent director
acts as lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all Board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of Abbott
and its shareholders. 
 
  



Chairman/Chief Executive Officer     


 Coherent leadership and direction for the Board and executive management 
 Clear accountability and a single focus for the chain of command to execute our strategic initiatives and business plans  
 CEO's extensive industry expertise, leadership experience, and familiarity with our business 
 With our CEO leading management and chairing the Board, we benefit from his strategic and operational insights, enabling a focused vision
encompassing the full range, from long-term strategic direction to day-to-day execution 

 
  



Lead Independent Director     


 Currently, the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee acts as the lead director 
 Chosen by and from the independent members of the Board of Directors, and serves as the liaison between the Chairman of the Board and the
independent directors 
 Facilitates communication with the Board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions
where the Chairman of the Board is not present 
 Reviews and approves matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other Board members  
 Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors and, if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he or she is available
for consultation and direct communication 
 The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates regularly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer regarding appropriate
agenda topics and other Board related matters

DIRECTOR SELECTION









The
Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board the nominees for
election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The process used by the Nominations and Governance Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors
depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. 
Abbott's
outline of directorship qualifications, which is part of Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). These qualifications describe specific characteristics that the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board take into
consideration when selecting nominees for the Board, such as: strong management experience and senior level experience in medicine, hospital administration, medical and scientific research and
development, finance, international business, government, and academic administration. An individual nominee is not required to satisfy all the characteristics listed in the outline of directorship
qualifications and there is no requirement that all such characteristics be represented on the Board. 
In
addition, Board members should have backgrounds that, when combined, provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Board candidates will
be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence, and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a
global business perspective and commitment to good corporate
citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the Board of Directors' oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each director's
biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the Board to conclude that the director should serve on the Board. The directors' biographies are on pages 12 through 17. 
A
description of the procedure for the recommendation and nomination of directors, including by proxy access, is on page 71. 
  
 
     




BOARD DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION









In
the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Nominations and Governance Committee considers the Board's diversity of relevant
experience, areas of expertise, ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. Five of the 12 directors nominated for election are
women or minorities. 
The
process used to identify and select nominees has resulted in an experienced, diverse, and well-rounded Board of Directors that possesses the skills and perspectives necessary for its oversight
role. All of Abbott's directors exhibit: 















     Global business
perspective     Knowledge of
corporate governance requirements and practices
 


     Successful track record
    High integrity
 


     Innovative thinking
    Commitment to good
corporate citizenship

*Each
of the committee members is financially literate, as is required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. The Board of Directors has determined
that Edward M. Liddy, the Audit Committee's Chair, is an "audit committee financial expert."  

 
  



Audit Committee     
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial reporting
practices and the audit process; the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements; the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance; the performance of Abbott's
internal audit function and internal auditors; and certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance. The Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the report of the Audit Committee is on
page 63. 
 
  



Compensation Committee     
The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in carrying out the Board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive
officers and directors. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the Board and gives its recommendations to
the full Board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director
compensation, the Compensation Committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. 
This
Committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate
the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or with the listing
rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The processes and 
​

​



 
Table of Contents
procedures
used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of the proxy captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The
Compensation Committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain, and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The Committee engaged Meridian Compensation
Partners, LLC as its compensation consultant for 2017. Meridian performs no other work for Abbott. The Committee engages compensation consultants to provide counsel and advice on executive and
non-employee director compensation matters. The consultant and its principal report directly to the Chair of the Committee. The principal meets regularly and as needed with the Committee in executive
sessions, has direct access to the Chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The Committee determines what variables it will instruct the
consultant to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's relative performance, competitive long-term
incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The Committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to the consultant for these services. Based on its
evaluation of Meridian's independence in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and information provided by Meridian, the Committee determined that the work performed by
Meridian does not present any conflicts of interest. A copy of the Compensation Committee report is on page 41. 
 
  



Nominations and Governance Committee     
The Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the
Board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders; recommends to the Board the people to be elected as executive officers of Abbott; develops and recommends to
the Board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to Abbott; and serves in an advisory capacity to the Board and the Chairman of the Board on matters of organization, management succession
plans, major changes in the organizational structure of Abbott, and the conduct of Board activities. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The process used by this Committee to identify a
nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying
individuals qualified to be Board members. The process used by the Committee to identify nominees is described on page 19 in the section captioned, "Director Selection." 
 
  



Public Policy Committee     
The Public Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain areas of
legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott. The Committee is governed by a written charter. 
 
  



Executive Committee     
The Executive Committee may exercise all the authority of the Board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for Board
action. 
  
 
     




COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS









Interested
parties may communicate with the Board of Directors by writing a letter to the Chairman of the Board, to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee, who acts
as the lead director at the meetings of the independent directors, or to the independent directors c/o Abbott Laboratories, 100

(1)Under
the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, non-employee directors earn $10,500 for each month of service as a director. Audit
Committee members, other than the Audit Committee chair, receive $500 for each month of service on the Audit Committee. Board Committee chairmen receive monthly fees of: $2,083.33 for the Audit
Committee chairman, $1,666.66 for the Compensation Committee chairman, $1,250.00 for the Public Policy Committee chairman, and $1,250.00 for the chairman of any other Board committee. In addition, the
lead director earns $2,500 for each month of such service and does not receive a fee for service as Nominations and Governance Committee chairman. Fees earned under the Abbott Laboratories
Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent appraisal of their fair value), deferred (as a
non-funded obligation of Abbott), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by the director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust
generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon retirement from the Board of Directors, if later. The director may elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to
either a guaranteed interest account or to a stock equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's
trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related common stock at year-end.
(2)The
amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines the grant date fair value of stock unit awards by multiplying the number of restricted stock units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of an
Abbott common share on the date of grant. In addition to the fees described in footnote 1, each non-employee director elected to the Board of Directors at the annual shareholders meeting receives
vested restricted stock units having a value of $150,000 (rounded down) under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program (effective as of the 2018 Annual Meeting this will increase to
$175,000 (rounded down)). In 2017, this was 3,437 units. The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the units at the same rate as other
shareholders. Upon termination, retirement from the Board, death, or a change in control of Abbott, a non-employee director will receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit
outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. The following Abbott restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2017: R. J. Alpern, 25,220; R. S. Austin, 32,883; S. E. Blount,
18,480;

  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS









 
  




  INTRODUCTION



 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes Abbott's executive compensation program in 2017. While the Summary Compensation Table on
page 44 provides the required disclosures for this proxy statement, we will also discuss the LTI grant made in February 2018, since that grant was based on 2017 performance. The LTI grant
disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table was made in February 2017 and was based on 2016 performance. 
In
particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and Board of Directors made compensation decisions for the Company's executives, including the seven named officers:
Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Brian B. Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Hubert L. Allen, Executive Vice President,
General Counsel and Secretary; Robert B. Ford, Executive Vice President, Medical Devices; Daniel G. Salvadori, Executive Vice President, Nutritional Products; Michael T. Rousseau, President,
Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation; and Eric S. Fain, Senior Vice President, Group President, Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation. Mr. Rousseau and Mr. Fain left during 2017. 
The
CD&A also describes the pay philosophy the Committee has established for the Company's executive officers, the process the Committee utilizes to examine performance in the context of executive pay
decisions, the performance goals and results for each named officer, and recent updates to our compensation program. 
 
  




  2017 PERFORMANCE



 
In 2017, Abbott achieved outstanding returns to shareholders, ranking #1 in our peer group. Abbott's one-year
total shareholder return (TSR) was 52.0%, which was 30.2 and 23.9 percentage points above the robust growth of both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA), respectively. In addition, Abbott:


 Raised the dividend by nearly 6%, marking Abbott's 94th consecutive year of dividends paid and the
46th straight year the dividend has been increased. 
 Returned $1.8 billion to Abbott shareholders through dividends. 
 Increased pre-tax earnings from continuing operations by 58%; including a $1.46 billion estimated net impact of U.S. tax reform, decreased net
earnings by 67% or, excluding the one-time impact of tax reform, increased net earnings by 71%. 
 Increased adjusted EBITDA by 43%. 
 Completed three major strategic initiatives in 2017 to shape the company for maximum competitiveness



 Divested Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) 
 Acquired St. Jude Medical 
 Acquired Alere Inc. 



At
a corporate level, all financial goals for officers were overachieved. This includes:


 Growing adjusted diluted EPS by 14%, from $2.20 to $2.50, above company targets and at the top end of the expected range.  
 Growing adjusted sales by 31%, an increase of $6.2 billion. 
 Increasing adjusted free cash flow by 113%, nearly 4 times the expected increase percentage. 

As
a result of the significant overachievement of these key financial and strategic goals, Abbott's market capitalization nearly doubled during 2017.

  VARIABLE PAY DECISIONS BASED ON 2017 PERFORMANCE



 
In February 2018, our Compensation Committee made pay decisions for our executive officers based on the design of our programs and our extremely strong
performance in 2017. The results of those pay decisions were as follows:


 Average bonus payouts were 105% of target reflecting overachievement of goals related to EPS, net income, sales, cash flow, return on assets,
and completion of three transactions critical to our strategic priorities. Individual payouts were aligned with individual performance and ranged from 18% to 163% of target.  
 2018 LTI award guidelines were set at the 75th percentile of our peer group, consistent with extremely strong relative total shareholder
returns through 2017. Individual awards were aligned with individual performance and ranged from the 24th to the 90th percentile. 

It
is important to understand the effect of the "lag" in the Summary Compensation Table, resulting from SEC proxy disclosure rules. Specifically, the amounts shown on page 44 reflect the annual
bonus for 2017 performance. However, the LTI awards shown in the table are for 2016 performance and were granted in February 2017. During 2016, despite strong operational results and the initiation of
important strategic actions, Abbott's returns to shareholders on a 1-, 3- and 5-year basis were in the lower quartile relative to our peers. Consistent with Abbott's philosophy to align LTI
compensation with TSR performance, these relatively lower total shareholder returns resulted in significantly below market long-term incentive grants for 2017. 
Due
to the significantly different LTI amounts granted in 2017 (using the 25th percentile guidelines) vs. 2018 (using the 75th percentile guidelines), we have disclosed the 2018 grant in
this proxy to aid shareholders in their understanding of our approach to compensation, which definitively aligns our LTI grant guidelines with relative TSR performance as illustrated below.

  COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND COMPONENTS OF PAY









Abbott
and its Compensation Committee have designed a compensation program to attract and retain executives whose talent and contributions support and advance the profitable growth
of the Company and growth in shareholder value. The program is designed to be:


Competitive: While we target competitive total compensation, actual payouts vary based upon
Company and individual performance. The Compensation Committee sets LTI awards based on relative Company performance. Each year, we look at LTI market percentiles between the
10th and the 90th to determine appropriate award levels. Actual pay reflects actual performance relative to peers. 
Aligned to our shareholders' interests: Almost two-thirds of our pay is equity-based, directly
tying a significant portion of executive compensation to shareholder returns. 
Performance-based: Other than base salary, which is the smallest component of our executives'
compensation, all remaining components of Total Direct Compensation (i.e., annual cash incentive, performance-based restricted stock awards, and stock options) are aligned with Company and/or
division performance. 
Balanced: Short- and long-term objectives focus our executives on actions that create value
today while building for sustainable future success. Our compensation program rewards the achievement of 



 Annual incentive payouts tied to current year operating performance vs. goals  
 Long-term incentive awards tied to longer-term returns to shareholders relative to peers and
sustained performance

  CHANGES BASED ON SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK AND MARKET PRACTICES









Last
year, shareholders owning 95% of our shares approved the compensation of our named executive officers. During 2017, we conducted outreach with a cross-section of shareholders
representing more than 60% of our outstanding shares. In those meetings, we discussed our pay programs broadly, including aspects that were previously subject to shareholder resolutions. Based on
shareholder discussions and recommendations, the Committee, during its annual evaluation of the Company's compensation programs and evolving market practices, made several changes to our programs. 



















   



 RECENT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CHANGES
    




 








 


 


 






      Significantly
strengthened peer group to reflect new business portfolio      Changed performance-based restricted stock awards to vest only over a 3-year term with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year  
   Increased the ROE target for vesting of performance
shares granted in two of the last three years      Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology
 






      Introduced new long-term
incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period      Increased disclosure related to payouts for both annual and long-term incentives      Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy      Implemented a strengthened recoupment
policy      Increased director
share ownership guidelines      Implemented a one-year minimum vesting period for long-term incentive grants
    
 




 



 




These
recent changes continue our practice of evolving our program based upon shareholder feedback as well as a review of market practices. Over the past several years, we have made numerous other
changes to our program, including:


 Using three performance assessments to determine the amount of equity awards:



 Relative TSR (compared to peer companies)Determines, as an aggregate target, where our equity grant guidelines should be
positioned relative to the market 
 Individual performanceDetermines individual officer awards based on equity grant guidelines (grant guideline x individual
performance factor) 
 The ROE targetEnsures that performance has been sustained before awards vest 


 Granting equity awards with double-trigger vesting in the event of a change in control 
 Eliminating tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Engaging a Compensation Committee consultant that performs no other work for Abbott 
 Adding a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met 
 Revising executive share ownership guidelines:



 Chief Executive Officer6 times base salary 
 Executive Vice President/Senior Vice President3 times base salary 
 All other officers2 times base salary

  HOW EXECUTIVE PAY DECISIONS ARE MADE









The
Committee makes compensation decisions in the context of the objectives of our program. The Committee ensures the compensation delivered to our executives is competitive, based
on performance, balanced between the short- and long-term, aligned with shareholder interests, and does not encourage excessive risk-taking. 
To
determine the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, the Committee, in consultation with its independent consultant, annually compares the level of compensation, market pay
practices, and our relative performance to those of peer companies. 
Our
shareholders compare us to other global multinational companies, only some of which are in healthcare. These companies share similar characteristics aligned with our investment identity of
diversified growth, returns to shareholders, and capital structure. 
The
peer group used for performance and compensation benchmarking prior to 2017 was established at the time of the AbbVie separation in 2013. That group has been used without change from 2013 through
2016. Due to the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc. and significant changes in several peers due to corporate transactions, the Committee and its consultant reviewed the
peer group to be used for 2017 benchmarking. Based on that review, the Committee approved an update to the peer group to better align to our current size, scope, and global footprint. 
Consistent
with our prior approach, our peer group was selected to strike the appropriate balance between size (both revenues and market capitalization), return profiles, geographic breadth, and
management and operating structure and has been overwhelmingly supported by our investors during shareholder outreach. The peer group purposely includes companies that are outside the healthcare
industry. 
In
selecting our peer group for 2017 performance and compensation benchmarking, we considered:


 Globally diverse manufacturing-driven organizations with significant international operations, sales, and profits  
 Consumer-facing organizations 
 Similar financial and operating measures, including market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees  
 Similar return of cash profiles, including dividends and share repurchases 
 Similar geographic mix of revenues and profits 
 Current proxy advisor guidelines regarding size of peers 

The
resulting peer group: 


 Excludes service companies 
 Has an average market capitalization well aligned with Abbott 
 Has an average sales size well aligned with Abbott; some are larger; some are smaller, but none are less than 40% of Abbott's sales

  FIXED PAYBASE SALARY



 
Base salary targets are set using the median of the peer group as an initial benchmark. Specific pay rates are based on an executive's performance,
experience, contribution, unique skills, and internal equity with others at Abbott. Base salaries range from the 10th to the 90th percentile of the peer
group, depending on experience, expertise, unique role requirements, and tenure. The average base salary of our executive officers was approximately at the market median. Once the rate of pay is set
at the time of hire or upon promotion, subsequent changes in pay, including salary increases, are based on the executive's performance, the job he or she is performing, internal equity, and the
Company's operating budget. 
 
  




  PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY



 
Abbott's primary performance-based compensation programs for executive officers are the annual cash incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan. These
plans are described in more detail on the following pages. While both plans are formula-driven based on specific operating, strategic, and leadership results, the performance criteria differs in terms
of the measures and the performance period. It is important to note that officer financial goals are based on adjusted measures that reflect the true results of our ongoing operations, which is what
our investors focus on and invest in.

  ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PLAN (PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN)



 
Our annual cash incentive plan is a key part of our officers' total compensation. It rewards executives for achieving specific annual goals at the corporate
and divisional levels. It also rewards executives for achieving operational and strategic goals. 
During
2017, Abbott's seven named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which was designed to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for performance-based compensation. 
 
  



Annual Cash Incentives Are Capped     
Each year, the Committee sets the maximum award allocations under the PIP for each named officer as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2017, the
maximum award for the Chief Executive Officer was 0.15% of adjusted consolidated net earnings for the fiscal year-end and, for all of the other named officers, 0.075% of adjusted consolidated net
earnings. Historically and in 2017, the Committee exercised its discretion to deliver PIP awards that were substantially below the maximum awards that are authorized by these formulas based on
achieved performance against annual goals and other factors described below. 
 
  



Process to Determine Awards     
Under the PIP, the Committee sets a target payout (expressed as a percentage of base salary) for each officer based upon market benchmarks and internal
equity. The final payout is determined based upon operating performance relative to annual goals. This process is described below. In 2017, annual incentive payouts for Abbott's executive officers
ranged from 18% to 163% of target, with an average of 105% of target, reflecting strong performance on an operational and strategic basis during the year. 


Step One: Fund Annual Incentive Pool Based on EPS
Achievement 
In
order for the PIP to pay out, the EPS goal (see 2017 Performance Goals for Performance Incentive Plan on page 38) must be achieved. If the EPS goal is not achieved, then
the PIP is not funded and there are no payouts. 


Step Two: Assess Individual Performance vs. Goals 
Individual
goals are finalized at the beginning of each year based upon each executive officer's responsibilities. The weighting of goals depends upon whether the executive is a
Business Unit leader or a Corporate leader, as follows:

Sales
growth performance required to earn payouts above 100% varies by business to reflect each business's market. To exceed a target payout in Sales Growth,
the business must grow market share, exceeding both peer sales growth rates and Abbott's internal targets. This approach sets a very high bar and is
more rigorous than market practice.

Financial Return GoalsWhile top-line growth is important, that growth must be profitable in order to drive value for our shareholders. To
stress the importance of profitability, each officer is assessed on relevant return goals, primarily earnings, margin contribution, and cash flow.

Financial
return performance required to earn payouts above 100% of target varies by business to reflect each business's market and operating environment. 
Strategic Initiative GoalsStrategic initiative goals are primarily related to key planned strategic actions, such as portfolio expansion,
key R&D milestones, gross margin expansion, and entry into new markets. Strategic goals are set such that fully successful achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout with no additional upside.
Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0% of target. 
Leadership GoalsLeadership goals are primarily related to talent and succession planning initiatives. These goals are focused on
stabilizing business leadership gaps, ensuring businesses have the talent they need to perform in the current period, and building our leadership bench to sustain our performance. Leadership goals are
set such that fully successful achievement of the goals results in a 100% payout with no additional upside. Lower levels of achievement result in payouts of 75%, 50%, or 0% of target. 
The
following formula summarizes the PIP payout process for a Business Unit leader, assuming the EPS goal is achieved (the process is identical for a Corporate leader).

Based
on performance against goals, 2017 cash incentive payouts ranged from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile of our peer group. The average 2017
cash incentive payout for our executive officers was at the 56th percentile of our peer group, consistent with strong performance in 2017. 
 
  




  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTI)



 
Our long-term incentive plan is the largest component of our executive officers' total compensation. As such, we believe it is critical that LTI performance
goals reflect Company and individual performance, on both an absolute and relative basis. The LTI process used in February 2017 (described below) resulted in annual grants to executive officers
ranging from the 5th percentile to the 51st percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 27th percentile. A preview of the February 2018 grant
(which will be disclosed in our 2019 Summary Compensation table) is also described below. 
 
  



Process to Determine Awards     
Our process for determining guidelines, individual awards, and vesting of those awards incorporates:


 TSR performance relative to our peers on a one-, three-, and five-year basis  Individual officer achievement of three-year sales,
profitability, and strategic goals  Each officer's performance relative to other officers 

​
Abbott
Laboratories      33
​




 









This process is far more rigorous than automatically granting LTI at the median of the market and adjusting the awards only for relative TSR at the end of the
performance cycle to determine the extent to which awards vest. 
We
followed a rigorous two-stage process to determine the size of LTI awards ultimately granted to our executive officers: 
Stage
One: Determine LTI Awards
Stage Two: Determine if Options and Shares Vest 
Stage One: Determine LTI Awards
In
order to determine LTI awards, Abbott follows three steps. 
Step ADetermine Company LTI Award GuidelinesAbbott obtains survey data annually to assess the competitive LTI market for our
peer group companies for each executive position. Each year, we position our LTI award guidelines relative to the competitive LTI market by comparing Abbott's TSR performance to our peers.  While most of our peer companies
simply set their annual LTI level at the 50th percentile of market, the following chart shows definitively how we adjust
our LTI grant guidelines to align with our relative TSR performance. For example, guidelines for grants made in February 2017 were set at the 25th percentile of our peer group as
illustrated in the 2016 Performance Year consistent with our relatively lower TSR vs. peers. Conversely, guidelines for grants made in February 2018 were set at the 75th percentile of
our peer group, reflecting very strong TSR vs. our peers. The variability produced by this process illustrates the direct alignment of our officers' pay with our shareholders'
returns.

(1)Relative
TSR quartile performance ranking uses a 1-4 scoring scale, with 1st representing highest quartile performance and
4th representing lowest quartile performance.  

Step BDetermine Individual Officer AwardsThe recommendation for each officer starts with the Company LTI award guideline
(based on relative TSR performance as described above) for the officer's position, as established in Step A. Individual officer awards are then further adjusted up or down
based upon assessment of their achievement of individual goals related to  


1)Three
Year Sales and Market Growth  2)Three
Year Margin Contribution  3)Three
Year Strategic Milestones 

Each
officer is assigned an overall score based on whether they missed, achieved, or exceeded the specific targets in all three measures for all three years. That resulting assessment score determines
the LTI performance adjustment. 
Awards
granted in 2017, based on individual officer performance in 2016, resulted in awards ranging from 26% to 135% of guideline award levels, with an average of 98% of the
25th percentile guideline. These awards resulted in annual grants to Abbott executive officers ranging from the 5th percentile to the
51st percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 27th percentile. 
Awards
granted in 2018, based on individual officer performance in 2017, resulted in awards ranging from 50% to 135% of guideline award levels, with an average of 104% of the
75th percentile guideline. These awards resulted in annual grants to Abbott executive officers ranging from the 24th percentile to the
90th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 77th percentile. 
​

Laboratories



 
Step CConvert Individual LTI Award Values to Equity GrantsIn 2017, to recognize the continued growth focus of Abbott and to
directly align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, the Compensation Committee granted the long-term incentive awards in the form of 50% stock options and 50%
performance-restricted shares. This mix is consistent with the practices of our peer group with respect to performance-based equity grants and was continued for our grants in 2018. 
Stage Two: Determine if Options and Shares Vest
Stock
options vest over three years. Since stock options only accrue value through share price appreciation, the value realized upon the exercise of vested stock options directly aligns the
compensation earned with the value shareholders received over the same period of time. Options are also aligned with shareholder value through the impact of relative TSR in determining the size of
awards granted (Stage One). 
Performance-restricted
shares vest 1/3 each year that the performance target is achieved. Vesting is absoluteeither 100% or 0%. There is no partial vesting if the target is
missed or additional vesting upside if the Company over-performs. The Committee believes adjusted return on equity (ROE) is the appropriate performance measure for vesting because ROE measures how
much profit the Company generates over the long-term with the capital that shareholders have invested and is a measure reflecting deployment of capital or capital allocation. 
Although
Company TSR performance and individual officer performance are used in Stage One to grant the appropriate award level, the focus on ROE for vesting provides a second shareholder protection to
ensure our growth and investment return objectives are sustained after the initial grant is made. ROE is only used for vesting; it is not used in the determination of LTI award guidelines or
individual officer performance. 

In
2016, the ROE vesting target to determine future vesting was increased from 11% to 12%. This increase is after a similar increase from 10% to 11% for grants made in 2015. This is consistent with
our stated intent to increase our ROE and ROE targets over time. 
Prior
to the separation of Abbott and AbbVie, the AbbVie business accounted for the majority (65%) of Abbott's adjusted net income. However, at the separation of AbbVie, Abbott retained the majority
(90%) of the equity, which has resulted in lower than average ROE for Abbott since that time. While Abbott's ROE was disproportionally lower following the AbbVie separation,
shareholders of Abbott at that time have seen a 135% appreciation in their holdings during the five years since separation.
(There
was a similar impact on other rate of return measures, including Return on Assets.)

  PAY DECISIONS FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



 
The following pages highlight the rationale for the pay decisions for each named officer. It is important to note that annual
incentive pay decisions were made in early 2018 based on 2017 results. Long-term incentive decisions (options and performance shares) shown in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement
were made in early 2017 based on 2016 results (see prior year proxy statement for discussion of 2016 results). We have also included information about our February 2018 LTI grants since they were
based on 2017 TSR performance. Specific 2017 financial goals are detailed on page 38.




Miles D. White  
Base SalaryNo increase. Mr. White last received a base salary increase in 2010. 
Performance
Incentive PlanMr. White's target bonus is 175% of base salary. Based on performance in 2017, Mr. White received a bonus in February
2018 of $4,500,000, which was equal to 135% of his target bonus. This payout reflects his significant overachievement of both financial and strategic goals, including 163% achievement of his free cash
flow goal, sustained overachievement of his sales and return goals, and the successful reshaping of Abbott through the AMO divestiture and the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and
Alere Inc. 
​
Abbott
Laboratories      35
​



 
Long-Term
IncentivesBased on performance in 2016, Mr. White received an LTI award in February 2017 with a value of $8,199,521, which was equal to
approximately 100% of his 25th percentile LTI award guideline. This award reflects a significant reduction in his award vs. the prior year and reflects Abbott's 2016 TSR
performance which was below our peers. 
Based
on performance in 2017, Mr. White received an LTI award in February 2018 with a value of $15,000,000, which was equal to approximately 137% of the market. This award reflects Abbott's
very strong operational performance during 2017, TSR performance at the top of the peer group and well ahead of the S&P 500 and DJIA, and the achievement of several important strategic goals
including the sale of AMO and acquisition of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc. The award also reflects Abbott's sustained strong financial returns under Mr. White's leadership,
including exceeding its adjusted diluted EPS growth commitments and consistently meeting or beating earnings
targets annually for the past 15 years. Additional details regarding that award will be included in Abbott's 2019 proxy statement. 




Brian B. Yoor  
Base
SalaryMr. Yoor's annual base salary was increased from $600,000 to $650,000 in February 2017 in connection with his transition to Executive Vice

Mr. Yoor received a bonus in February 2018 of $1,062,400, which was equal to 156% of his target bonus. This payout reflects significant overachievement of both financial and strategic goals,
including 163% achievement of his free cash flow goal, and overachievement of his sales and return goals. Mr. Yoor's strategic and leadership goals for 2017 included M&A activity support,
transformation of the finance organization, and implementation of key financing and cash flow improvement initiatives which significantly overachieved their targets. In addition to the calculations
derived from the scoring of financial and strategic goals, the plan allows further adjustments up or down by the Compensation Committee to reflect achievements not anticipated when goals were set. For
2017, the Committee adjusted Mr. Yoor's bonus (by $300,000) to reflect the unanticipated achievements. 
Long-Term
IncentivesBased on performance in 2016, Mr. Yoor received an LTI award in February 2017 with a value of $1,754,876, which was equal to 90% of
his 25th percentile LTI award guideline. 
Based
on performance in 2017, Mr. Yoor received an LTI award in February 2018 with a value of $5,383,800, which was equal to approximately 135% of his 75th percentile LTI
award guideline. This award reflects Abbott's and Mr. Yoor's strong performance during 2017. Additional details regarding that award will be included in Abbott's 2019 proxy statement.

  BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES



 
Each of the benefits described below was designed to support the Company's objective of providing a competitive total pay program. Individual benefits do not
directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. 















 



 




 



 Benefits and Perquisites 







 Description 







 ​


 
 
 Retirement Benefits
 
 The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott
Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, with the exception of Mr. Roussseau and Mr. Fain who joined Abbott as a part of the St. Jude Medical acquisition and are not eligible for these programs. These plans are described in greater
detail in the "Pension Benefits" section of the proxy.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Since officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust,
officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax
withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the officers' actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8%) while they are employed. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are
not tax deferred.
 
 


 
 
 
 
 Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon
retirement from the Company generally follows the manner elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse, depending upon the pension distribution method elected by the officer under the Annuity
Retirement Plan) live beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit and, therefore, exhaust the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid by the Company.

 Officers of the Company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary and bonus (in certain cases), on a
pre-tax basis, to the Company's qualified 401(k) plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18% of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan, with the exception of
Mr. Fain and Mr. Rousseau who are eligible to participate in the legacy St. Jude Medical Management Savings Plan which provides matching payments for employees whose annual salary, commission and bonus exceed the IRS qualified plan
limits. Unlike other U.S. managers, officers are not eligible to elect to defer compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan. However, up to one hundred percent (100%) of annual incentive awards earned under the Company's Performance Incentive
Plan is eligible for deferral to a non-qualified plan. Officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax
withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or
other separation from the Company.

 Benefits and Perquisites 







 Description 







 ​


 
 
 Change in Control Arrangements
 
 Mr. White, Mr. Rousseau and Mr. Fain do not have Abbott change in control agreements. The other named officers have Abbott
change in control agreements, the purpose of which is to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the Company, and protect the earned
benefits of the officer against adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to the Committee by its
independent compensation consultant. These arrangements are described in greater detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.

 Financial Planning
 
 Named officers are eligible to receive up to $10,000 of fees annually associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation, and general
financial planning. If an officer chooses to utilize this benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation are paid by the Company and are treated as imputed income to the officer, who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due
on the fees paid by the Company.

​



​






 
 
 Company Automobile
 
 Named officers are eligible for use of a Company-leased vehicle, with a lease term of 50 months. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost

  SHARE OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION GUIDELINES



 
To further promote sustained shareholder return and to ensure the Company's executives remain focused on both short- and long-term
objectives, the Company has established share ownership guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the
position.

All
named officers with 5 years' tenure in their current position meet or exceed the guidelines. 
 
  




  HEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from entering into or engaging in any financial transaction that is designed to reduce the financial
risk associated with owning Abbott stock. These financial transactions include, but are not limited to, engaging in short sales, derivative transactions (such as equity swaps, straddles, puts, or
calls), and hedging or monetizing transactions (such as collars, exchange funds, or prepaid forward variable contracts) that are linked directly to Abbott stock.

  PLEDGING



 
Directors and officers are prohibited from holding Abbott stock in a margin account, pledging Abbott stock, or otherwise securing any of their obligations by
assigning Abbott stock as collateral. The Compensation Committee, or its delegate, may grant an exception provided that:


 The director or officer meets Abbott's applicable minimum stock ownership guideline; and 
 Only Abbott stock in excess of the applicable minimum stock ownership guideline is held in the margin account, pledged, or assigned as
collateral. 

 
  




  RECOUPMENT POLICY



 
In 2015, following discussions by management with shareholders, the Compensation Committee implemented a recoupment policy. The Compensation Committee has
broad discretion to administer and implement the policy and seek recoupment of equity or cash incentive awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory
capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that causes significant financial harm to Abbott. The Compensation Committee may recover incentive compensation awarded to a senior
executive in the prior three years or reduce future awards. The policy will not affect awards made prior to its effective date or following a change in control. 
 
  




  COMPLIANCE



 
The Committee considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and reserves the flexibility to take
actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and
flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, Abbott may provide compensation that is not deductible.
Section 162(m) (as amended in 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) generally disallows, subject to certain exceptions, a federal income tax deduction to public companies for compensation in
excess of $1 million per year paid to an individual who was the company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer at any time during the year, or was one of the company's three other
most highly compensated executive officers as listed in the proxy. 
 
  
 
     






  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT









The
Compensation Committee of the Board is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving, and overseeing Abbott's compensation plans and practices, and works with management and the
Committee's independent consultant to establish Abbott's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with
management and has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

  COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT









During 2017, Abbott conducted its annual risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for employees and executives. Abbott's risk assessment is
reinforced by Abbott's adherence to a number of industry-leading best practices, including: 














 
Compensation Committee chaired by independent, non-employee director





 
Representation from the Audit Committee on the Compensation Committee





 
Review of executive compensation programs by the Compensation Committee's independent consultant





 
Robust review of compensation program elements and key performance drivers





 
Detailed measurement of short- and long-term compensation elements, and related performance metrics and requirements, to ensure balance





 
Incorporation of multiple program requirements that mitigate excessive risk-taking (e.g., recoupment policy, stock ownership and share retention guidelines, caps on incentive programs)




Based on this assessment, Abbott determined its compensation and benefit programs appropriately align employees' compensation and performance without incentivizing risky behaviors. Any
risk arising from its compensation policies and practices is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Abbott or its shareholders. 
The following factors were among those considered:


Regular training on code of business conduct and policies and procedures is mandatory for all employees and non-employee
directors. 
Compensation structure encourages employees to regard Abbott as a career employer, to consider the long-term impact of their
decisions, and to align their interests with those of Abbott's shareholders (e.g., equity awards that vest over multi-year periods, defined benefit pension plan).  
Annual benchmarking ensures performance achievement and incentive payout opportunities that are aligned with a peer group that
reflects the size, investment profile, operating characteristics, and employment and business markets of Abbott. Appropriateness of this group is assessed annually by the Compensation Committee's
independent consultant and reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. 
Abbott's annual incentive plan places an appropriate weighting on earnings achievement by balancing it with other factors,
including key operational and strategic measures. Since earnings are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of Abbott's compensation plan promotes alignment with shareholder interests
without creating duplication across incentive plans. 
Abbott's long-term incentive plan focuses on longer-term operating performance and shareholder returns, (e.g., in 2017,
roughly two-thirds of named officer total compensation was in the form of long-term equity incentives that can be earned or vest over multiple years).  
Equity awards are made, and grant prices are set at the same time each year, at the Compensation Committee's regularly
scheduled meeting. In addition, Abbott does not reprice stock options, award discounted stock options, or immediately vest stock options or restricted stock. The equity awards are based on multiple
performance factors. Both executive and Director share ownership guidelines and share retention requirements promote alignment with shareholders.  
Abbott's compensation program does not include features that could encourage excessive risk taking, such as over-weighting
toward annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, uncapped incentive award payments, unreasonable thresholds, or steep payout cliffs at certain levels that may encourage short-term business
decisions to meet payout criteria.

Abbott's recoupment policy allows the Compensation Committee to seek recoupment of incentive compensation or reduce future
awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that caused significant financial
harm to Abbott. 
Abbott's hedging policy prohibits directors and officers from entering into financial transactions designed to reduce the
financial risk associated with owning Abbott shares. 
Abbott's pledging policy prohibits directors and officers from holding Abbott shares in a margin account, pledging Abbott
shares, or securing obligations by assigning Abbott shares as collateral unless granted an exception by the Compensation Committee. 

This assessment was discussed with the Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant. The Committee and the consultant both agreed with the
assessment.

(3)Cash
payment made upon Mr. Rousseau's successful completion of his planned transition period under the terms of a retention agreement entered
into in connection with Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical.
(4)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the
awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. Abbott determines grant date fair value by multiplying the number of shares granted by the average of the high and low
market prices of an Abbott common share on the award's date of grant.
(5)In
accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the
awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718. These amounts were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. These
amounts are being reported solely for the purpose of comparative disclosure in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined using a
Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash. The assumptions are the same as those described in Note 9, entitled
"Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Abbott's 2017 Annual Report on
Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.
(6)This
compensation is earned as a performance-based incentive bonus, pursuant to the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan. Additional
information regarding the Performance Incentive Plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeAnnual Cash Incentive Plan (Performance Incentive Plan)."

(ii) a cash payment under the terms of a retention agreement entered into in connection with Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical: E. S. Fain: $1,485,260. 
The
named officers, other than Messrs. Rousseau and Fain, are also eligible to participate in an executive disability benefit described on page 59.  


(9)To
demonstrate how year over year changes in pension value impact total compensation, as determined under SEC rules, we have included this column to
show total compensation without pension value changes. The amounts reported in this column are calculated by subtracting the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column, as described in footnote 7 to this table, from the amounts reported in the Total column. The amounts reported in this column differ from,
and are not a substitute for, the amounts reported in the Total column.

(1)During
2017, each of the named officers participated in the 1998 Abbott Laboratories Performance Incentive Plan, an annual, non-equity incentive plan.
The annual cash incentive award earned by the named officer in 2017 under the plan is shown in the Summary Compensation Table under the column captioned, "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No
future payouts will be made under the plan's 2017 annual cash incentive award. The Performance Incentive Plan is described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned,
"Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are Made."
(2)These
are performance-based restricted stock awards that have a 5-year term and vest upon Abbott reaching a minimum return on equity target, with no
more than one-third of the award vesting in any one year. In 2017, Abbott reached its minimum return on equity target and one-third of each of the awards made on February 17, 2017, vested on
February 28, 2018. The equity targets are described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisHow Executive Pay Decisions Are
MadeLong-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)." Beginning with grants made in 2018, performance-based restricted stock awards have a 3-year term. This change is described in the section of the proxy
statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisChanges Based on Shareholder Feedback and Market Practices."
(3)In
the event of a grantee's death or disability, these awards are deemed fully earned. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control is
described in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Outstanding restricted shares receive dividends at the
same rate as all other shareholders.
(4)Options
with respect to one-third of the shares covered by these awards are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three
years. The options vest in the event of the grantee's death or disability. The treatment of these awards upon a change in control is described in the section of the proxy statement captioned,
"Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Under the Abbott Laboratories 2017 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the
average of the high and low market prices (rounded-up to the next even penny) of an Abbott common share on the date of grant.
(5)Abbott
determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number of restricted shares granted by the average of the high and low
market prices of a common share on the grant date.
(6)These
values were determined as of the option's grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The model uses the assumptions described
in Note 9, entitled "Incentive Stock Program" of Abbott's Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" in Abbott's 2017
Annual Report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K.
(7)In
accordance with the award terms, these awards were forfeited on July 21, 2017 when Mr. Fain left Abbott.
(8)This
is a restricted stock award that, in accordance with the award terms, vested on July 21, 2017 when Mr. Fain left Abbott. Additional
information regarding this award can be found in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards."

(i)St. Jude
Medical, Inc. granted these awards prior to its acquisition by Abbott. In connection with the acquisition, rather than settling
in cash as permitted under the St. Jude equity plans, Abbott assumed all of St. Jude Medical's outstanding and unvested stock options and converted them into options to purchase Abbott
common shares, with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such St. Jude Medical award.

  PENSION BENEFITS









During
2017, Messrs. White, Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Salvadori participated in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement
Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature
Abbott uses to attract officers who are at the mid-point of their careers. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have
spent most of their careers at Abbott. Except as provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change
in control agreements are described on pages 59 and 60. 
The
compensation considered in determining the pension is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. 
 
  




  ANNUITY RETIREMENT PLAN



 
The Annuity Retirement Plan covers eligible employees in the United States who are age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at
normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  

A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by
years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 0.50% of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage
base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit service.
C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 
The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and
employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Annuity Retirement Plan
covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Participants hired after 2003 who
terminate prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Participants hired prior to 2004 who
terminate prior to age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Participants hired prior to 2004 who 
​
Abbott
Laboratories      55



 
Table of Contents
terminate
prior to age 50 with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
The
Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Participants
who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Participants hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55
with 10 years of service. Participants hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit
service total 70 or more. As of December 31, 2017, Mr. White was eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching
age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit
is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement:


 In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are
made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. 
 Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age
plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94
before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement applies,
Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 12/3 percent for each year
between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for
each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before
age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 
  




  SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN



 
With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement
Plan:


 Officers' 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of
payments under Abbott's non-equity incentive plans. 
 The Annuity Retirement Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the Abbott Laboratories Deferred Compensation Plan in
its calculation of a participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a
participant under the Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. Beginning in the year following their election as an officer, Abbott officers are no longer eligible to
defer compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Annuity Retirement Plan, participating officers are eligible for a benefit equal to 0.6% of
5-year final average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited by the maximum
percentage allowed under the Annuity Retirement Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B, and C above). The portion of this additional officer benefit attributable to service prior to 2004 is
reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year
for each year that payments are made before the plan's unreduced retirement age if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion
attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
 The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The benefits
provided to Abbott's officers under the Supplemental Pension Plan are reduced 

​

Laboratories
​



 
Table of Contents


from
the plan's unreduced retirement age, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. As of December 31, 2017, Mr. White was eligible for early retirement benefits under
the plan. 


 Vested plan benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by the officer. Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those officers who were elected prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan
benefits funded through a grantor trust. Officers elected after 2008 may only have the vested plan benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which the officer is first elected funded through
a grantor trust. Vested plan benefits accrued through December 31, 2008, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual trusts and included in the
participants' income.

payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The
amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental
Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

(1)Abbott
calculates these present values using: (i) a 3.88% discount rate for the Annuity Retirement Plan and a 3.81% discount rate for the
Supplemental Pension Plan, the same effective discount rates it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 calculations for financial reporting purposes; and (ii) each plan's
unreduced retirement age. The present values shown in the table reflect post-retirement mortality, based on the Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 715 assumption (the RP2006
Combined Healthy table with projected mortality improvements), but do not include a factor for pre-retirement termination, mortality, or disability.
(2)Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits, to the extent not previously funded, were distributed to the participants' individual grantor trusts and included in the participants' income. Amounts held in the officer's individual trust
are expected to offset Abbott's obligations to the officer under the plan. During 2017, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established by the
named officers. Grantor trusts are described in greater detail in the section of the proxy statement captioned, "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisBenefits and Perquisites."

(1)The
Management Savings Plan permits participants to defer up to 80 percent of their base pay and up to 100 percent of their annual cash
incentives, other bonuses, and commission compensation, and credits a participant's account with matching contributions at the rate applicable under the participant's tax-qualified defined
contribution plan, up to a maximum of $3,000. Participants may direct the investment of their accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral and the deferral
account are credited with investment returns based on the performance of the fund(s) selected. During 2017, the weighted average rate of return credited to Mr. Rousseau's account was
10.6 percent and to Mr. Fain's account was 19.0 percent.
(2)The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in
accordance with specific procedures. Participants make distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the
hardship.

  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL









 
  




  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATIONGENERALLY



 
Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. 
Messrs. Rousseau
and Fain had change in control agreements with St. Jude Medical, Inc. prior to its acquisition by Abbott and entered into retention agreements with Abbott in
connection with the acquisition. Payments made under their respective agreements are described in footnotes 3, 6, and 8 of the Summary Compensation Table on pages 44 through 46 and in
the section of the proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards" on pages 60 and 61. 
The
following summarizes the payments that the named officers, other than Messrs. Rousseau and Fain, would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2017. Earnings
would have continued to be paid to the named officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully
distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the period over which the trusts' assets were distributed and the trusts' earnings. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year
period and based on current earnings, the named officers would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period:


 M. D. White, $1,471,131 
 B. B. Yoor, $55,145 
 H. L. Allen, $178,314 
 R. B. Ford, $93,613 
 D. G. Salvadori, $6,888 

​
58      Abbott
Laboratories
​




 









Table of Contents 
In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for the following named
officers:


 B. B. Yoor, $276,073 
 H. L. Allen, $157,998 
 R. B. Ford, $228,380 
 D. G. Salvadori, $73,121 

If
the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers also would have received, in addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability
benefit in the amount of:


 M. D. White, $225,000 
 B. B. Yoor, $53,120 
 H. L. Allen, $50,760 
 R. B. Ford, $53,320 
 D. G. Salvadori, $36,685 

This
long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the officer retires, recovers, dies, or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In
addition, if the employment of these named officers had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31,
2017 with values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Equity Awards." 
 
  




  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL



 
Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement with Abbott.
Abbott
has change in control arrangements with other key members of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for certain other
management personnel. The agreements with Mr. Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Salvadori are described below. Messrs. Rousseau and Fain did not have change in control agreements with Abbott. 
Each
change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2018, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal
is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the
one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years
following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this
purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and
the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid
bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for
good reason during a potential change in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of
the bonus to which the officer is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within
the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the
potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer
in the preceding three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including
welfare benefits, outplacement services and tax and financial counseling, and the value of three more years of pension accruals).

Table of Contents
If
change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, payments under the agreement will be reduced to
prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the executive in a better after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit
the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. 
For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the
outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors whose appointment was approved by a
vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under the agreements
includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the executive's
position, duties, or authority; Abbott's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of Abbott's principal executive offices
to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2017 immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Mr. Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Salvadori would have been
entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements:

  EQUITY AWARDS



 
Under Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, upon a change in control, the surviving company may assume, convert, or replace awards to executive
officers on an equivalent basis. If the surviving company does not do so, then the awards vest. If the surviving company does assume, convert, or replace the awards on an equivalent basis, then the
awards vest if the officer's employment is terminated without cause or the officer resigns for good reason during the period six months prior to and through two years after a change in control. The
term "good reason" has the same definition as in the change of control agreements. 
If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2017, and the surviving company did not assume, convert, or replace the awards, then Messrs. White, Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Salvadori
would have vested in the following options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units:

The
value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of a common share on December 31, 2017 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of unvested
stock options held by the named officer. The value of restricted shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted shares that would vest as of December 31, 2017 and the
closing price of a common share on December 31, 2017.

Table of Contents
In
addition, prior to its acquisition by Abbott, St. Jude Medical, Inc. had granted to Messrs. Rousseau and Fain restricted stock unit and stock option awards. In connection with
the acquisition, rather than settling in cash as permitted under the St. Jude equity plans, Abbott assumed all of St. Jude Medical's outstanding and unvested restricted stock units and
stock options and converted them into Abbott restricted stock units and options to purchase Abbott common shares, respectively, with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
such St. Jude Medical award. In accordance with the terms of the St. Jude Medical award agreements assumed by Abbott, Messrs. Rousseau's and Fain's outstanding converted
St. Jude Medical awards vested when they left Abbott on July 7, 2017 and July 21, 2017, respectively. A restricted stock award held by Mr. Fain also vested on
July 21, 2017. Consistent with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, Messrs. Rousseau and Fain received portions of their converted St. Jude Medical
restricted stock units on their respective vesting dates for payment of withholding taxes and the remainder were settled on January 7, 2018 and January 21, 2018, respectively. The values
of the converted St. Jude Medical restricted stock unit awards received on their respective vesting and settlement dates were as follows: M. T. Rousseau: Vesting date: $159,271;
Settlement date: $4,784,443; and E. S. Fain: Vesting date: $77,480; Settlement date: $1,832,323. The values of the converted St. Jude Medical stock options on their respective
vesting dates were as follows: M. T. Rousseau: $14,156,810; E. S. Fain: $5,985,741. The value of Mr. Fain's restricted stock award on its vesting date was $2,581,197. The values of the
converted St. Jude Medical restricted stock unit awards and Mr. Fain's restricted stock award are determined by multiplying the number of shares vested and the closing price of a common
share on the applicable settlement date and July 21, 2017, respectively. The values of the converted St. Jude Medical stock options are based on the excess of the closing price of a
common share on the applicable vesting date over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of stock options held.  
  
 
     






  CEO PAY RATIO









In
2017, we compared CEO pay to that of our median employee. To identify our median employee, we first excluded all 3,653 employees who are employed in Bolivia (213), Egypt (332),
Indonesia (633), Mexico (1,122), Peru (1,329), and Venezuela (24), representing less than 5% of our global workforce of 89,647 employees as of October 1, 20171. We then examined
the 2017 base salary of all remaining employees globally, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on October 1, 2017. We annualized the base salary of all permanent employees who were hired
in 2017 but did not work for the entire year. The base salary for employees outside of the U.S. was converted to U.S. dollars. 
After
identifying the median employee, we collected annual total compensation for this employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as disclosed in the Summary
Compensation Table on page 44 and then added the cost of medical and dental benefits ($12,597) in the calculation of annual total compensation for the median employee and CEO. 
The
annual total compensation of our median employee was $75,679, resulting in a ratio of 251:1. 
The
above ratio and annual total compensation amount are reasonable estimates that have been calculated using methodologies and assumptions permitted by SEC rules.

  RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS AUDITORS  (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Abbott's By-Laws provide that the Audit Committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as
auditors. In October 2017, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to act as auditors for 2018. Ernst & Young LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2014. 
Although
the Audit Committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for
2018. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2018, the Audit
Committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2018.
Representatives
of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be
available to respond to appropriate questions. 
 
  




  AUDIT FEES AND NON-AUDIT FEES



 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for
the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and fees billed for other services rendered by Ernst & Young during these periods.

  POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR



 
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent auditor
and its related affiliates. 
Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year
for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
Prior
to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm
and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered
public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent
registered public accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at
its next scheduled meeting. 
  
 
     






  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE









Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit
of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as
well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this context, the
Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public
accounting firm. 
The
Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 16  (Communications with Audit Committees),
 as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public
accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 62 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees" is
compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

  SAY ON PAYAN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)



 
Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission
rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related material included in this proxy statement. 
In 2017, Abbott achieved outstanding returns to shareholders, ranking #1 in our peer group. Abbott's one-year total shareholder return (TSR) was
52.0%, which was 30.2 and 23.9 percentage points above the robust growth of both the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA),
respectively. Abbott continues to be recognized as a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, having increased the dividend payout for 46 consecutive years. 



In
2017, Abbott continued to strategically shape its business through the additions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc. The St. Jude Medical business expands Abbott's presence into
multiple new areas of cardiovascular care, as well as neuromodulation, transforming Abbott into a broad-based leader in medical devices. Alere Inc. extends Abbott's long-established presence
and leadership in diagnostics into rapid testing, an attractive and high growth area of testing in both developed and emerging markets. In addition, Abbott continues to have a strong organic pipeline
of innovative new products across each of our major businesses, including novel technologies for glucose-monitoring, neuromodulation, cardiovascular care and fully-integrated diagnostic testing
solutions. Together, this high level of R&D productivity and strategic shaping gives Abbott an exciting portfolio of businesses with the presence and capabilities in both developed and emerging
markets to create new market opportunities for long-term growth. 
The
vast majority of compensation for our executive officers is performance-based and objectively determined. Long Term Incentives (LTI), which comprise the largest percentage of compensation for our
executive officers, are directly linked to shareholder returns. Each year, LTI award guidelines are determined based on relative TSR performance compared to our peer group. The Compensation Committee
looks at 1-, 3-, and 5-year TSR in making these
determinations. The table below illustrates the relative TSR and award guidelines since 2013 for executive officers at Abbott.

Not
only is a direct link evident in these results; it can reasonably be concluded that Abbott has been conservative in setting target payout levels. This linkage translates into significant
differentiation of pay for our executives, aligned

returns to our shareholders. The table below illustrates the pay outcomes for our CEO based on results each year since the separation of AbbVie. Again, a direct pay for performance link is very

*Pay
decisions represent summary compensation table earnings, excluding the change in pension value (which is primarily
driven by changes in discount rates) and adjusted to reflect Stock Awards and Option Awards aligned to the year of grant (since the Committee grants those in February of each year based
on the prior year performance). 

We
continually evolve our compensation program based on feedback from shareholders, as well as changes in our business. Some of the recent changes made include the following: 





 Changed performance-based restricted stock awards to vest only over a 3-year term with no more than one-third of the award vesting in any one
year 
 Selected a new peer group that reflects the globally diverse and consumer-facing aspects of Abbott 
 Increased executive and director share ownership guidelines 
 Added a share retention requirement which applies until share ownership guidelines are met 
 Eliminated single-trigger vesting of equity in the event of a change in control 
 Eliminated tax gross-ups in our executive officer pay program 
 Implemented a hedging policy and a pledging policy 
 Implemented a one-year minimum vesting period for long-term incentive grants 
 Increased the ROE target for performance shares in two of the last three years 
 Revised annual cash incentive plan goals and scoring methodology 
 Revised long-term incentive measures to reflect sustained performance over a three-year period 
 Increased disclosure related to payouts for annual and long-term incentives 
 Implemented a strengthened recoupment policy 
 Retained an independent Compensation Committee consultant who performs no other work for Abbott 




We
received positive feedback on these changes from our shareholders during our extensive shareholder outreach. 
The
Compensation Committee, with the counsel of its independent consultant, concluded that the compensation reported herein was earned and appropriate. The specific details of the executive
compensation program and compensation paid to the named executive officers are described on pages 26 through 41 of this proxy statement. Consistent with the preference expressed by shareholders
as part of the 2017 advisory vote, the Board adopted an
annual advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation. 
While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results and take into account the
results and our ongoing dialogue with shareholders when future compensation decisions are made. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers' compensation.

  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL



 
  
 
     






  INTRODUCTION









One
shareholder proposal has been received and will be voted upon at the annual meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the proponent. Abbott is advised that the
proposal will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed resolution and the statement made in support thereof, as well as the Board of Directors' statement in opposition to this
proposal, are presented on the following pages. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  THE PROPOSAL












Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman
(Item 4 on Proxy Card)  
 



Mr. Kenneth
Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, New York 11021 has informed Abbott that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that he owns no fewer than
500 Abbott common shares. 
 
 
  




  PROPONENT'S STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL



 
 
    Proposal 4Independent Board Chairman     
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the
Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next CEO transition, implemented so it does not
violate any existing agreement. 
If
the Board determines that a Chair ,who was independent when selected, is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable
amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to
accomplish the above. 
Caterpillar
is an example of a company recently changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had strongly opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman as
recently as its 2016 annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman in 2016. 
It
was reported in 2015 that 53% of the Standard & Poors 1,500 firms separate these 2 positions. This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73% support
at Netflix. 
At
Abbott Laboratories this proposals topic climbed from 30%-support in 2015 to 37%-support in 2017. This 37%-support would have been higher (possibility 42%) if small shareholders had the same access
to corporate governance information as large shareholders. 
Meanwhile
our Chairman /CEO received the highest negative votes of any director. This was 10-times the negative votes received by Daniel Starks who is relatively new to our board. The management
response to the 2017 proposal on this topic did not say that our Lead Director was important enough to call a special shareholder meeting. 
In
its response to this proposal our company could possibly name one step it has taken in 2017 to advance management accountability to shareholders. 
Please
vote to enhance CEO accountability to shareholders: Independent Board ChairmanProposal 4

    Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman     
 
    (Item 4 on Proxy Card)     
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal. 
Abbott
has received this shareholder proposal seven times since 2005 (many of which were submitted by this very shareholder). And seven times, Abbott's shareholders have rejected it. Each time this
proposal returns, the Board reminds shareholders why they have rejected this cookie-cutter proposal so many times already: (a) there is no proved improvement to governance or performance in
separating the CEO role from the chairman role; (b) Abbott's existing governance structure ensures appropriate oversight of management; and (c) the Board is entrusted to act in
shareholders' best interests already, and as such should be free to exercise its judgment to select the best person for the chairman role. Last year, the majority of Abbott's shareholders
overwhelmingly rejected the proposal again. Given the considerable success Abbott has had with its leadership structure to date, Abbott recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal for an
eighth time. 
When
it comes to corporate governance, no single leadership structure is appropriate for every company. Empirical studies have found that mandating a board chairman separate from the company CEO
does not guarantee any better operating performance or improved corporate governance.(1) This is why, for the last two years, not a single proposal advocating this change has garnered
enough shareholder support to pass at any company. In fact, more large-cap companies combined the
chairman and CEO roles in 2017 than in the previous year. 
Rather
than preclude certain candidates from the chairmanship, Abbott ensures oversight of its management through other meansmeans the Board believes are more suitable to Abbott. For
instance, every Abbott Board member (other than the Chairman) satisfies the New York Stock Exchange's criteria for being independent. This year,
Abbott added two new independent directors. This full Board of independent directors evaluates the CEO's performance annually and regularly reviews leadership structure. And these independent
directors sit on all key committees that oversee the integrity of Abbott's financial statements, executive compensation, and the nomination of new directors, among other functions. Further still,
Abbott also has a lead independent director who can preside over meetings of the independent directors and meet with the Chairman to discuss any matter arising from these meetings. This lead
director can also call additional meetings of the independent directors (which is, Abbott's entire Board minus the Chairman) as deemed necessary and perform any other function as the Board may
direct. 
This
structure provides Abbott's Board with appropriate and desired flexibility. The Board is not unnecessarily precluded from considering certain candidates from serving as Chairman. Rather, after
considering all the relevant factors, the candidate's experience, and the Board's own strategic vision for the company, the Board selects who is best suited to serve as Chairman. And when the time
comes for Abbott to transition to new leadership, the Board is not arbitrarily prohibited from considering any of its options to lead Abbott's Boardbe it the outgoing CEO, the new CEO,
or an independent director. 
Contrary
to the suggestion in the shareholder's proposal, the Board believes that Abbott's existing leadership structure has served shareholders well. Under the current joint CEO and Chairman
structure, Abbott has continuously transformed through several strategic actions. In just the past year, Abbott acquired St. Jude Medical, Inc., and Alere Inc., creating a
medical devices and diagnostics leader, positioning the company for continued profitable growth. Abbott continues to develop one of the leading pipelines of innovative and promising new healthcare
products. All of this activity has inured to the benefit of Abbott's shareholders. In fact, in just 2017, Abbott's one-year total shareholder return was 52%, which was 30.2 percentage points
above the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. If a shareholder had invested in Abbott in 1999, and held those shares until about the end of January, that shareholder would have enjoyed an
approximate gain of 299%. 
The
Board continues to believe that providing it with the ability to choose the appropriate candidate for Chairman and/or CEO serves the interest of shareholders. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

  APPROVAL PROCESS FOR RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS



 
It is Abbott's policy that the Nominations and Governance Committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott participates
and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related
person transactions requiring review by the Nominations and Governance Committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:


 questionnaires annually distributed to Abbott's directors and officers; 
 certifications submitted annually by Abbott officers related to their compliance with Abbott's Code of Business Conduct; or  
 communications made directly by the related person to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel. 

In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Nominations and Governance Committee will consider the following items, among
others:


 the related person's relationship to Abbott and interest in the transaction; 
 the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of
principal involved; 
 the benefits to Abbott of the transaction; 
 if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; 
 an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees
generally; 
 whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and 
 whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 

This
process is included in the Nominations and Governance Committee's written charter, which is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website
(www.abbottinvestor.com). The spouse of one of our executive officers, Jaime Contreras, is employed by Abbott. During 2017, her total compensation
exceeded the foregoing threshold.

  PROCEDURE FOR RECOMMENDATION AND NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AND TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS AT ANNUAL MEETING









 Proxy Access:    A shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning continuously for at least three years Abbott common shares representing an aggregate of at
least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, may nominate and have included in Abbott's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board, provided
that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in Abbott's By-Laws. 
Nominating
shareholders are permitted to include in Abbott's proxy statement a 500-word statement in support of their nominee(s). Abbott may omit any information or statement that it, in good faith,
believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state a material fact, or would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    A shareholder may also recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the
names of such persons in writing to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee or the Secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and
confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A
shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on:


 the record date for that Annual Meeting, 
 the date the shareholder provides timely notice to Abbott, and 
 the date of the Annual Meeting 

may
directly nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the Secretary of Abbott. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    The notice submitted by a shareholder must include certain information required by
Article II of Abbott's By-Laws, including information about the shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or
associates or others acting in concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
For
each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business
at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director nomination, including
through proxy access, the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
To
be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director, including through proxy access, or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's
principal executive offices not less
than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within twenty-five days
before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual
Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for the 2019 Annual Meeting, this written notice
must be received by Abbott no later than January 25, 2019. 
In
addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the Annual Meeting and
as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the Secretary of Abbott at Abbott's principal executive offices not more than five
business days after the record date for the Annual Meeting, and not less than eight business days before the date of the Annual Meeting in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as
of ten business days prior to the Annual Meeting.

  EXHIBIT A



 
 
  




  DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE STANDARD



 
No director qualifies as "independent" unless the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with Abbott or
its subsidiaries (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Abbott or any of its subsidiaries). In making this determination, the board
shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the following standards:


 A director is not independent if the director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of Abbott or its subsidiaries, or an
immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of Abbott or its subsidiaries. 
 A director is not independent if the director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period
within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from Abbott or its subsidiaries, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for
prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service), and other than amounts received by an immediate family member for service as an employee (other than an
executive officer). 
 A director is not independent if (A) the director or an immediate family member is a current partner of a firm that is Abbott's internal
or external auditor; (B) the director is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and personally works
on Abbott's or its subsidiaries' audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on Abbott's
or its subsidiaries' audit within that time. 
 A director is not independent if the director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an
executive officer of another company where any of the present executive officers of Abbott or its subsidiaries at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee.  
 A director is not independent if the director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company
that has made payments to, or received payments from, Abbott or its subsidiaries for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of
$1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues. 
 A director is not independent if the director is an executive officer of a charitable organization that received charitable contributions
(other than matching contributions) from Abbott and its subsidiaries in the preceding fiscal year that are in excess of the greater of $1 million or 2% of such charitable organization's
consolidated gross revenues.

  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION



 
Abbott uses various non-GAAP financial measures to adjust for specified items that are unusual or unpredictable, such as cost reduction
initiatives, restructuring programs, integration activities and other business acquisition-related costs, the estimated 2017 impact of U.S. tax reform, and the recognition of a gain and deferred taxes
associated with the sale of the Medical Optics business. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude intangible amortization expense to provide greater visibility on the results of operations
excluding these costs, similar to how Abbott's management internally assesses performance. 
Abbott's
management believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding Abbott's results of operations as these non-GAAP financial
measures allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance. Abbott's management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to monitor performance. Abbott, however, cautions
investors to consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
The
reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Earnings from Continuing Operations is as follows:
