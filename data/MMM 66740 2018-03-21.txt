DIRECTOR NOMINEES – DIVERSITY OF SKILLS
AND EXPERIENCE
 
The Nominating and Governance
Committee identifies, reviews, and recommends nominees to the Board for approval. The Committee seeks individuals with distinguished
records of leadership and success and who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively represent the
interests of all stockholders. The Committee considers a wide range of factors and experiences, including ensuring an experienced,
qualified Board with expertise in the following key areas most relevant to 3M. The numbers in parentheses represent the number
of director nominees who the Committee believes possess each of the skills and experiences.

Significant Corporate Governance Actions
 
We recently implemented
several changes that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong corporate governance practices:
 
Board Refreshment
 
We regularly add directors
to infuse new ideas and fresh perspectives into the boardroom. In the past five years, seven new independent directors have joined
our Board. In recruiting directors, we focus on how the experience and skill set of each individual complements those of their
fellow directors to create a balanced board with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds, deep expertise, and strong leadership experience.
Amy E. Hood joined the Board in August 2017. Amy Hood is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Microsoft Corporation,
responsible for leading the worldwide finance organization, including acquisitions, treasury activities, tax planning, accounting
and reporting, and internal audit and investor relations. She brings tremendous skill and experience to the Board, especially
in strategic business development, finance and digitization.
 
Stockholder Engagement
 
We maintain a vigorous
stockholder engagement program. During 2017, members of senior management met with a cross-section of stockholders owning approximately
35 percent of our outstanding shares or approximately 50 percent of our institutional stockholders. The meetings included an overview
of the Company and a discussion of the Company’s practices on corporate governance. Staff from our sustainability organization
also attended these meetings and summarized 3M’s more than 40 years of environmental stewardship. The feedback from these
meetings was shared with the Board of Directors and helped inform the Board on corporate governance practices and trends.
 
Executive Compensation
 
2017 Financial Performance and Business Highlights
 
For 3M, 2017 was a year
of strong financial performance achieved through solid growth and disciplined execution. Given the impact that the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Reform Legislation”) and a related $600 million pension contribution had on the Company’s
2017 financial performance, our results are shown below both as determined in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable)
and excluding the impact of certain items stemming from the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation and 3M’s related pension contribution.

Table of Contents

We believe that our ability
to deliver consistent results over time is reflected in our total stockholder return, which was in the top half of our executive
compensation peer group for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ending on December 31, 2017. For additional information, see
“Total Stockholder Return” on page 41 of this Proxy Statement.
 
Other noteworthy accomplishments
include the following:
 


 
●
Enhanced 3M’s array of safety
    products and solutions through the acquisition of Scott Safety, making us even more relevant to our customers worldwide;

 
 
 

 
●
Awarded a record total of 4,168 patents from
    patent offices around the world in 2017, including 708 patents granted to 3M by the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
    which brings to more than 113,000 the total number of patents awarded to 3M in its corporate history;

 
 
 

 
●
Strengthened our portfolio going forward by
    completing or announcing the divestiture of all or substantially all of four businesses that no longer align with our strategic
    objectives: identity management, electronic monitoring, tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and optical
    fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry;

 
 
 

 
●
Recognized by Ethisphere® as
    one of the World’s Most™ Ethical Companies® for the fifth consecutive year;

 
 
 

 
●
Nearly completed the rollout of the enterprise
    resource planning (ERP) system in West Europe, and successfully started the initial deployment in the United States;

 
 
 

 
●
Over 100 consecutive years of paying dividends
    to stockholders; and

 
 
 

 
●
Returned $4.9 billion to stockholders via dividends
    and gross share repurchases.

our financial performance and its impact on the compensation of our executives, see page 38 of this Proxy Statement. For more

Compensation Policies and Practices
 
Our compensation program
is designed to provide appropriate performance incentives and avoid compensation practices that do not promote the interests of
our stockholders.
 



WE DO

 


Maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance
and our executive officers’ compensation by having a majority of Total Direct
Compensation consist of performance-based compensation.


Conduct an annual assessment for the purpose of identifying and mitigating significant economic and reputational risks in the design of our incentive compensation programs.


Have a comprehensive clawback policy.


Use an independent compensation consultant retained
by, and reporting directly to, the Committee.


Limit the number and amount of executive perquisites.


Prohibit our executive officers from hedging or pledging
3M common stock.


Maintain robust stock ownership guidelines applicable
to all of our executive officers.


Conduct competitive benchmarking to align executive
compensation with the market.





WE DO NOT

 


Have employment, severance, or change in control agreements
with any of our executive officers.


Provide tax gross-ups on executive perquisites.


Have agreements that would provide automatic “single-trigger”
accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to
any of our executive officers upon a change in control.


Provide dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned
equity awards.


Reprice stock options without the approval of
3M stockholders, except for “anti-dilution” adjustments (such as adjustments in
connection with a stock split, spinoff, etc.)

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 


 
Noteworthy Compensation Actions for 2017
and Early 2018
 
During 2017 and the first
two months of 2018, the Company took a number of actions that were intended to create a more unified program structure that applies
to all eligible employees throughout the organization and simplify the design and administration of our compensation programs.
Effective as of January 1, 2017, to encourage performance that exceeds targets and better align incentive compensation opportunities
between those employees compensated on the basis of corporate performance and those employees compensated based on the performance
of one or more businesses, we adjusted our approach to setting financial performance targets for the Annual Incentive Plan. In
addition, the Company took the actions listed below, effective as of January 1, 2018.
 


 
●
Increased the payout slopes and further adjusted our
    approach to setting financial performance targets for the Annual Incentive Plan. These changes are intended, among other things,
    to better align payout opportunities with those of the Company’s executive compensation peer group by strengthening
    “rewards” for participants when plan targets are exceeded and consequences when they are not.

 
 
 

 
●
Eliminated the Company’s historical practice of granting prorated
    performance share awards to newly appointed or promoted members of the Company’s senior management (which generally
    consists of approximately 100 of our top employees), and aligned the retirement vesting provisions of performance share awards
    for newly appointed members of senior management with those provided to other members who did not receive prorated grants.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE AT 3M
 
Proposal No. 1: Elect the Twelve Directors
Identified in this Proxy Statement
 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting,
twelve directors are to be elected to hold office until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors have
been elected and qualified. All nominees are presently 3M directors who were elected by stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting,
except for Amy E. Hood, who joined the Board on August 13, 2017, and Michael F. Roman, who was nominated by the Board on March
5, 2018 to stand for election for the first time. We expect each nominee for election as a director to be able to serve if elected.
If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for substitute
nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board. Each nominee elected as a director
will continue in office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation,
or retirement. Vance D. Coffman is no longer eligible to stand for reelection as he has reached the mandatory retirement age of
74 under the Board’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. Dr. Coffman will continue to serve as a director until the 2018 Annual
Meeting.
 
The Nominating and Governance
Committee reviewed the Board Membership Criteria (described on page 13) and the specific experience, qualifications, attributes,
and skills of each nominee, including membership(s) on the boards of directors of other public companies. The following pages
contain biographical and other information about the nominees. Following each nominee’s biographical information, we have
provided information concerning the particular experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that are deemed most critical
to 3M’s long-term success and led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that each nominee should
serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our directors serve or have served on boards and board committees (including
as committee chairs) of other public companies, which the Board believes provides them with additional board leadership and governance
experience, exposure to best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the functioning of our Board.

Table of Contents

Board Membership Criteria
 
3M’s Corporate Governance Guidelines
contain Board Membership Criteria which include a list of key skills and characteristics deemed critical to serve 3M’s long-term
business strategy and expected to be represented on 3M’s Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically reviews
with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board composition. It is
the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a high performance organization creating competitive advantage for the
Company. To perform as such, the Board will be composed of individuals who have distinguished records of leadership and success
in their arena of activity and who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively represent the interests
of all stockholders. The Committee’s and the Board’s assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to,
consideration of:
 


 
●
Roles in and contributions valuable to the business community;

 
 
 

 
●
Personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect, competence, and adherence to the highest ethical standards; 

 
 
 

 
●
Relevant knowledge and diversity of background and experience in business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing, international business, government, and other areas; and 

 
 
 

 
●
Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation, and attendance at all meetings.

 
In addition to these minimum requirements,
the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominee’s skills are complementary to the existing Board members’ skills,
the Board’s needs for particular expertise in certain areas, and will assess the nominee’s impact on Board dynamics,
effectiveness, and diversity of experience and perspectives.
 
Director Nominees – Diversity of
Skills and Experience

nominees’ key skills and experiences in the areas that are most relevant to 3M and shows the number of director nominees

Diversity
 
For 3M, diversity, in its myriad manifestations,
is fundamental to innovation, performance, and relevancy. 3M employees reflect that diversity. The Board of Directors regards diversity
as an important factor in selecting board nominees to serve on the board. Although the Board has no specific diversity policy,
when selecting nominees, it actively considers diversity in recruitment and nomination of directors, such as gender, race, and
national origin. The current composition of our Board reflects those efforts and the importance of diversity to the Board.
 
Identification, Evaluation, and Selection
of Nominees
 
The Committee periodically reviews the appropriate
size and composition of the Board and anticipates future vacancies and needs of the Board. In the event the Committee recommends
an increase in the size of the Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified nominees from several sources, including
current Board members and nominees recommended by stockholders and other persons.
 
The Committee may from time to time retain
a director search firm to help the Committee identify qualified director nominees for consideration by the Committee.
 
The Committee retained Spencer Stuart in
2017 to help identify future Board candidates.
 
The Committee evaluates qualified director
nominees at regular or special Committee meetings against the Board Membership Criteria described above then in effect and reviews
qualified director nominees with the Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board interview candidates that meet the Board
Membership Criteria and the Committee selects nominees that best suit the Board’s current needs and recommends one or more
of such individuals for election to the Board.
 
Director Independence
 
The Board has adopted a formal set of Director
Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director independence, which either conform to or are more exacting
than the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing standards, and the full text of
which is available on our website at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations — Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines,
a director or nominee for director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company other than as a director.
The Guidelines specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines
for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent
registered public accounting firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation Committee members from having any direct
or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and restrict both commercial and not-for-profit relationships of all directors
with the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by the Company, and all directors are required
to deal at arm’s length with the Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as
a conflict of interest.
 
In accordance with these Guidelines, the
Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships
between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each
of the most recent three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships
between the Company and a director or any members of a director’s immediate family (or any entity of which a director or
an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder). The Board considered that in
the ordinary course of business, transactions may occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of
our directors are or have been officers. In particular, the Board considered the annual amount of sales to 3M for each of the most
recent three completed fiscal years by each of the companies where directors serve or have served as an executive officer, as well
as purchases by those companies from 3M. The Board determined that the amount of sales and purchases in each fiscal year was below
one percent of the annual revenues of each of those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence Guidelines.
The Board also considered charitable contributions to not-for-profit organizations with which our directors or immediate family
members are affiliated, none of which approached the threshold set forth in our Director Independence Guidelines.
 
As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively
determined that the following directors are independent under these Guidelines: Sondra L. Barbour, Thomas “Tony” K.
Brown, Vance D. Coffman, David B. Dillon,

G. Thulin, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is considered to not be independent because of his employment
by the Company.

The Committee has a policy to consider properly
submitted stockholder recommendations for candidates for membership on the Board of Directors. Stockholders proposing individuals
for consideration by the Committee must include at least the following information about the proposed nominee: the proposed nominee’s
name, age, business or residence address, principal occupation or employment, and whether such person has given written consent
to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. Stockholders should send the required
information about the proposed nominee to:
 



Corporate Secretary

In order for an individual proposed by a
stockholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation as a Board nominee for the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Corporate
Secretary must receive the proposal by November 21, 2018. Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail
(or other means that allows the stockholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The Corporate Secretary

Individuals proposed by stockholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the same consideration received by individuals
identified to the Committee through other means.
 
Stockholder Nominations - Advance Notice
Bylaw
 
In addition, 3M’s Bylaws permit stockholders
to nominate directors at an annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance
with the notice of meeting. Stockholders intending to nominate a person for election as a director must comply with the requirements
set forth in the Company’s Bylaws. With respect to nominations to be acted upon at our 2019 Annual Meeting, our Bylaws would
require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the record stockholder no earlier than November
21, 2018, and no later than December 21, 2018. The notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which
is available on our website at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations — Governance. Nominations received after December
21, 2018, will not be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
 
Proxy Access Nominations
 
Further, pursuant to the proxy access Bylaw
adopted by the Board in November 2015, a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, continuously owning for three years
at least three percent of our outstanding common shares may nominate and include in our proxy materials up to the greater of two
directors and 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving, if the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the Bylaw requirements.
For eligible stockholders to include in our proxy materials nominees for the 2019 Annual Meeting, proxy access nomination notices
must be received by the Company no earlier than November 21, 2018, and no later than December 21, 2018. The notice must contain
the information required by the Bylaws.

Role of the Nominating and Governance
Committee
 
The Nominating and Governance Committee
identifies individuals who the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members in accordance with the Board Membership
Criteria set forth above, and recommends selected individuals to the Board for nomination to stand for election at the next meeting
of stockholders of the Company in which directors will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on the Board between meetings
of stockholders, the Committee seeks to identify individuals who the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members in
accordance with the Board Membership Criteria, and may recommend one or more of such individuals for appointment to the Board.
The Nominating and Governance Committee also focuses on overall Board-level succession planning at the director level.
 
Corporate Governance Overview
 
The Company believes that good corporate
governance practices serve the long-term interests of stockholders, strengthen the Board and management, and further enhance the
public trust 3M has earned from more than a century of operating with uncompromising integrity and doing business the right way.
The following sections provide an overview of 3M’s corporate governance practices, which are published on the Company’s
website, including the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board’s leadership structure and the responsibilities of the
independent Lead Director, communication with directors, director independence, the director nomination process, the Board’s
role in risk oversight, the Codes of Conduct for directors and employees, public policy engagement, and the Company’s commitment

The meetings included an overview of the Company and a discussion of the Company’s practices on corporate governance and sustainability. The feedback from those meetings was shared with the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board and helped inform the Board on corporate governance practices and trends.


Our independent Lead Director is available to meet with major stockholders upon request.

 
 

Risk
    Oversight


The Board oversees the Company’s risk profile and management’s processes for assessing and managing risk, both as a whole Board and through its committees. At least annually, the Board reviews enterprise risks facing the Company and certain of its businesses. Other important categories of risk are assigned to designated Board committees (which are comprised solely of independent directors) that report back to the full Board. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee through its charter the primary responsibility for the oversight of risks facing the Company including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee’s charter provides that the Audit Committee shall “discuss policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company’s major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.”

Key Levers.

THE 3M PLAYBOOK
 
 
 
Our Vision captures our
aspirations and guides our corporate direction - 3M Technology Advancing Every Company, 3M Products Enhancing Every Home, 3M Innovation
Improving Every Life. For 115 years, we have advanced, enhanced and improved companies, homes and lives around the world. Our
six strategies provide the roadmap for achieving our goals. They guide us to actively identify and align to external opportunities
including customers, markets, and macro trends while continuously investing in our internal capabilities such as technology, manufacturing,
global reach, and the 3M Brand. Our Leadership Behaviors (Play to win, Innovate, Foster collaboration and teamwork, Prioritize
and execute, Develop others and self, Act with integrity and transparency) describe how leaders lead at 3M.
 
Our Code of Conduct serves
as a constant reminder of our core values. The Code is structured around six core values - Be Good, Be Honest, Be Fair, Be Loyal,
Be Accurate, and Be Respectful.
 
Our Playbook also defines
three Key Levers that we use to operationalize our Playbook throughout the Company and create value across 3M - Portfolio Management,
Investing in Innovation, and Business Transformation.
 
Portfolio Management seeks
to align resources behind the best opportunities, investing in attractive, high-value markets, while de-emphasizing or exiting
less attractive spaces. Investing in Innovation is an important element in delivering premium value for our customers and premium
returns for our shareholders. Business Transformation starts and ends with our customers and is fundamentally transforming the
Company and how we do business. We are optimizing and standardizing our global business processes to generate scale and leverage,
deploying a single instance global ERP system that provides data transparency across the enterprise, and creating a global service
model to optimize our supply chain and business services operations. All of these activities significantly enhance customers’
experiences with 3M, making our customers more efficient and competitive, while also improving our internal efficiency and productivity
in everything that we do, in a sustainable way – making us more competitive and profitable.
 
In combination, the five
elements outlined in the Playbook serve as the foundation for our strategy. We are focused on succeeding in attractive global
markets ensuring we deliver value to our customers, shareholders, and employees.

Board’s Role in
Risk Oversight
 
The Board oversees the
Company’s risk profile and management’s processes for assessing and managing risk, both as a whole Board and through
its committees. At least annually, the Board reviews enterprise risks facing the Company and certain of its businesses. Other
important categories of risk are assigned to designated Board committees (which are comprised solely of independent directors)
that report back to the full Board. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee through its charter the primary responsibility
for the oversight of risks facing the Company including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee’s charter provides that the Audit
Committee shall “discuss policies and procedures with respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Company’s
major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such exposures.”
 
The Vice President and
General Auditor, Corporate Auditing (the “Auditor”), whose appointment and performance is reviewed and evaluated by
the Audit Committee and who has direct reporting obligations to the Committee, is responsible for leading the formal risk assessment
and management process within the Company. The Auditor, through consultation with the Company’s senior management, periodically
assesses the major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible for managing each specific risk. The Auditor
periodically reviews with the Audit Committee the major risks facing the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor
and mitigate those risks. The Auditor’s risk management report, which is provided in advance of the meeting, is reviewed
with the entire Board by either the chair of the Audit Committee or the Auditor. The executive responsible for managing a particular
risk may also report to the full Board on how the risk is being managed and mitigated.
 
The Board has delegated
to other committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise. For example, the Compensation Committee
oversees risks associated with the Company’s compensation practices, including by performing an annual review of the Company’s
risk assessment of its compensation policies and practices for its employees. The Finance Committee oversees risks associated
with the Company’s capital structure, credit ratings and cost of capital, long-term benefit obligations, and use of or investment
in financial products, such as derivatives to manage risk related to foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rates. The
Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks associated with the Company’s overall governance and its succession planning
process to ensure that the Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates for key management positions.
 
The Board believes that
its oversight of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee, but also through delegation to other committees to
oversee specific risks within their areas of responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full Board,
is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. The chair of each committee that oversees risk
provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full Board following each committee meeting. The minutes
of each committee meeting are also provided to all Board members. The Board also believes its oversight of risk is enhanced by
its current leadership structure (further discussed below) because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Company’s
management of risk, also chairs regular Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, the CEO
is best able to bring key business issues and risks to the Board’s attention.
 
Management Succession
Planning
 
The Board plans the succession
to the position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions. To assist the Board, the Chairman/CEO and Senior Vice President
of Human Resources annually assess senior managers and their succession potential for the position of Chairman/CEO and other
senior management positions. As a result of a thorough and thoughtful succession planning process, on March 5, 2018, the Board
appointed Michael F. Roman CEO, effective July 1, 2018, succeeding Inge G. Thulin.
 
Communication with Directors
 
The Board of
Directors has adopted the following process for stockholders and other interested parties to send communications to members
of the Board. Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board, or with any of our other independent directors,
or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address: Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building
220-13E-26A, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. The Corporate Secretary reviews communications to the independent directors and
forwards those
 


2018

Table of Contents

communications to the
independent directors as discussed below. Communications involving substantive accounting or auditing matters will be
immediately forwarded to the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Company’s Chief Compliance Officer consistent with
time frames established by the Audit Committee for the receipt of communications dealing with these matters. Communications
that pertain to non-financial matters will be forwarded promptly. Items that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities
of the Board will not be forwarded, such as: business solicitation or advertisements; product-related inquiries; junk mail or
mass mailings; resumes or other job-related inquiries; and spam.
 
Compliance
 
3M’s Codes of
Conduct
 
More than a century of
operating with uncompromising integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility with our communities, and dedication
from our employees. All of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting
Officer, are required to abide by 3M’s Code of Conduct to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal
and ethical manner. These policies form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance with corporate policies
and procedures and a Company-wide focus on uncompromising integrity in every aspect of our operations. Our Code of Conduct covers
many topics, including antitrust and competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting, protection of confidential information,
and compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of our business.
 
Employees are
required to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the Code of Conduct.
The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal
accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous submission by employees or others
of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Information on how to submit any such communications can
be found on 3M’s Investor Relations website, under Governance — Governance Documents — Employee Business
Conduct Policies — “Report a concern or ask a question.” Our Chief Compliance Officer, who has direct
reporting obligations to the Audit Committee, periodically reports to the Audit Committee on compliance with the
Company’s Code of Conduct, including the effectiveness of the Company’s compliance program.
 
The Board also has adopted a Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors of the Company. This Code incorporates long-standing principles of conduct the
Company and the Board follow to ensure the Company’s business and the activities of the Board are conducted with
integrity and adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in compliance with the law. The Company’s Code of Conduct
for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are available on our website at www.3M.com
under Investor Relations — Governance — Governance Documents.
 
Public Policy Engagement
 
The Company believes
that transparency with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement with lawmakers is important
to our stockholders, and continuously makes efforts to give our stockholders useful information about our public policy
engagement. Since 2007, the Company has voluntarily published a detailed explanation of the Company’s political
activities which is available on our website at www.3M.com under Investor Relations — Governance —
Governance Documents — “Political Activities and Issue Advocacy.” There, the Company sets out in detail its
positions on important public policy issues, the factors we consider when making political contributions, and the processes
we use for legal, financial, executive, and Board oversight of our political activities and contributions. We also provide
links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files monthly with the Federal Election Commission and the
Company’s quarterly Lobbying Disclosure reports, as well as a detailed list of our contributions to state candidates
and political parties, and contributions to “527” political organizations. The Company also discloses on its
website the trade associations the Company joined where $25,000 or more of the dues are allocated for lobbying purposes by
the trade association. The Company believes that these disclosures on our website, which exceed the disclosures required by
law, offer transparency respecting the Company’s public policy engagement and political activities.

Commitment to the Environment
and Sustainability
 
At 3M, we are working hard
to advance every company, enhance every home, and improve every life. We apply our expertise, and technology to solve problems
collaboratively, and with a focus on long term, sustainable solutions that demonstrate our commitment and societal purpose. Sustainability
is fundamental to our business — from sustainability-inspired innovation to product stewardship to sustainability in our
operations. As we seek to improve every life, we see partnerships to help our customers and communities achieve their sustainability
goals as key to that ambition.
 
For more than 40
years, 3M has been a leader among global corporations in sustainability actions and measures, beginning with the creation of
its groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) Program in 1975. As a global corporation, we believe that we have a
significant responsibility to society globally, and responsibility to the local communities in which we live and work. Our
corporate vision states: “3M technology advancing every company... 3M products enhancing every home... and 3M
innovation improving every life.” It is that vision — carried out in collaboration with our customers,
communities, and partners — that guides our sustainability strategies and goals and aspirations. Our sustainability
efforts improve 3M operations and the operations of our customers. Our product solutions help customers manage their
environmental footprint - from paint systems that reduce the need for cleaning solvents to window films that ease energy
consumption. Our life cycle management process enables teams to select more sustainable components and encourage more
sustainable processes. In addition, our philanthropic and social sustainability programs support the workforce of the future
– both in Science, Technology, Education and Math (STEM), as well as the skilled trades. For example, our
skills-based volunteering programs for employees encourage sustainability thinking inside the company while supporting the
environmental and social needs in our local communities. Our 2025 sustainability goals provide us with a holistic approach to
driving sustainability in our own operations, in our communities, and for the needs of our customers.
 
In January 2013, our CEO
elevated the company’s focus on sustainability, with emphasis in two areas: (1) developing and commercializing products
which help our customers solve their sustainability challenges; and, (2) driving sustainability within 3M operations and supply
chain. Sustainability is now embedded across the company with dedicated teams in R&D, Supply Chain, business groups, and regions
across the globe. Recently, the establishment of an executive committee, the Science, Technology, and Sustainability Committee,
provides leadership, oversight, and strategy to encourage and ensure sustainability opportunities are recognized and strong policies
and procedures are in place. In addition, our Corporate EHS and Business Conduct Committee ensures our sustainability principles
are embedded throughout the company.
 
As part of our
sustainability efforts, we are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights — a policy initiative
for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ten principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and
anti-corruption. We also align our goals and programs to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We report annually
on these efforts in our Sustainability Report. To learn more, please visit www.3M.com/Sustainability.
 
Related Person Transaction
Policy and Procedures
 
The Board of Directors
has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures which is administered by the Nominating and Governance
Committee. This Policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant,
the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material
interest and which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Transactions that fall within this definition
are referred to the Committee for approval, ratification, or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts
and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are
in the best interests of the Company. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a transaction, the Committee
considers:
 


 
●
the nature of the Related Person’s interest in the transaction;

 
 
 

 
●
the material terms of the transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less
    favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances;

 
 
 

 
●
the significance of the transaction to the Related Person;

 
 
 

 
●
the significance of the transaction to the Company;

 
 
 

 
●
whether the transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act
    in the best interest of the Company; and

 
 
 

 
●
any other matters the Committee deems appropriate.

 
Any Committee member who
is a Related Person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote respecting such
approval or ratification, except that such a director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting at which
the Committee considers the transaction. There were no Related Person Transactions that were referred to the Committee in 2017.

Policy on Adoption of
a Rights Plan
 
In 2002 and 2003, a 3M
stockholder submitted a stockholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting a stockholders’ rights plan
(also known as a “poison pill”). 3M does not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The
Board continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would give the Board
the negotiating power and leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M stockholders in the context of a takeover effort.
 
Following consideration
of the favorable vote the stockholder proposal received and in light of this belief, the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement
of policy on this topic. The Board’s policy is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either (1) stockholders have approved
adoption of the rights plan or (2) the Board (including a majority of the independent members of the Board), in its exercise of
its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests
of 3M’s stockholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting from seeking stockholder approval.
 
The Board has directed
the Nominating and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the Board on any recommendations
it may have concerning the policy. The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3M’s published Corporate Governance
Guidelines and its Proxy Statement.
 
Board Structure and
Processes
 
Board’s Leadership
Structure
 
The Board’s current
leadership structure is characterized by:
 


 
●
a combined Chairman of the Board and CEO;

 
 
 

 
●
a strong, independent, and highly experienced Lead Director with well-defined responsibilities
    that support the Board’s oversight responsibilities;

 
 
 

 
●
a robust committee structure consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight
    of various types of risks; and

 
 
 

 
●
an engaged and independent Board.

 
The Board of
Directors believes that this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement while deriving the
benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the Board. As the individual with primary responsibility for managing
the Company’s day-to-day operations and with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the Company, our CEO is best
positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues. Coupled with an
independent Lead Director, this combined structure provides independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion
regarding the Board’s oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of business operations.
 
The Board
believes that adopting a rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO would
inhibit the Board’s ability to provide for a leadership structure that would best serve stockholders. As a result, the
Board has rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the positions of Chairman and CEO in its Corporate
Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed at least annually and available on our website at www.3M.com, under Investor
Relations — Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that allows it, in representing the stockholders’
best interests, to decide who should serve as Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or anticipated
future circumstances.
 
The Board believes that
combining the roles of CEO and Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective Board. The Board believes that to drive change
and continuous improvement within the Company, tempered by respect for 3M’s traditions and values, the CEO must have maximum
authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving
growth, managing the Company’s day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the Company, and reinforcing the expectation
for all employees of continuing to build on 3M’s century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing business the
right way.
 
The Board
believes that the Company’s corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue to effectively
oversee the Company’s management and key issues related to executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning,
strategy, risk, and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part, that:
 


 
●
Independent directors comprise a substantial majority of the Board;

 
 
 

 
●
Directors are elected annually by a majority vote in uncontested director elections;

3M


 
Table of Contents



 
●
Only independent directors serve on the Audit, Compensation, Finance,
    and Nominating and Governance Committees;

 
 
 

 
●
The committee chairs establish their respective agendas;

 
 
 

 
●
The Board and committees may retain their own advisors;

 
 
 

 
●
The independent directors have complete access to management and employees;

 
 
 

 
●
The independent directors meet in executive session without the CEO or other employees during
    each regular Board meeting; and

 
 
 

 
●
The Board and each committee regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it
    and its committees function effectively.

 
The Board has also designated
one of its members to serve as Lead Director, with responsibilities (described in the next section) that are similar to those
typically performed by an independent chairman.
 
On March 5, 2018, the Board
appointed Michael F. Roman CEO, effective July 1, 2018. He succeeds Inge G. Thulin, who is appointed to a newly created position,
executive chairman of the Board, also effective July 1, 2018.
 
Independent Lead Director
 
The Board has designated
one of its members to serve as a Lead Director, with responsibilities that are similar to those typically performed by an independent
chairman (“Lead Director”). Michael L. Eskew was appointed Lead Director by the independent directors effective November
12, 2012, succeeding Dr. Vance Coffman who had served as Lead Director since 2006. Michael Eskew is a highly experienced director,
currently serving on the boards of The Allstate Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, and International Business Machines Corporation,
and is the former Chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service, Inc. His responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
 


 
●
Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present,
    including executive sessions of the independent directors;

 
 
 

 
●
Acts as a key liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;

 
 
 

 
●
Approves the meeting agendas for the Board, and approves the meeting schedules to assure
    that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;

 
 
 

 
●
Has the authority to approve the materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of
    each Board meeting and provides feedback regarding the quality, quantity, and timeliness of those materials (this duty not
    only gives the Lead Director approval authority with respect to materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each
    Board meeting but also provides a feedback mechanism so that the materials may be improved for future meetings);

 
 
 

 
●
Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;

 
 
 

 
● 
Communicates Board member feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the Compensation
    Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEO’s performance and communicates the Board’s evaluation of that
    performance to the Chairman/CEO);

 
 
 

 
●
If requested by major stockholders, ensures that he is available, when appropriate, for consultation
    and direct communication; and

 
 
 

 
●
Performs such other duties as requested by the independent directors.

 
Executive Sessions
 
As an agenda item for every
regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting, independent directors regularly meet in executive session, without the Chairman/CEO
or other members of management present, to consider such matters as they deem appropriate. The Lead Director presides over the
Board’s executive sessions.
 
Board Committees
 
Board, Committees, and
Director Evaluations
 
The
Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively and consider
opportunities for continual enhancement. The Nominating and Governance Committee solicits and receives comments from all
directors and shares those comments with the Board. Based on the comments and further discussion and reflection, the Board
makes an assessment reviewing areas in which the Board believes improvements could be made to increase the effectiveness of
the Board and its committees as well as

identifying existing practices
which have contributed to high effectiveness and accordingly should be continued. Self-evaluation items requiring follow-up and/or
the development and execution of implementation and action plans are monitored on a going-forward basis by the full Board, as
well as by individual committees and the chairs thereof, as applicable. While this formal self-evaluation is conducted on an annual
basis, directors share perspectives, feedback, and suggestions year-round. The Board and each committee conducted an evaluation
of its performance in 2017.
 
Before the November Board
meeting, the Chairman/CEO, Lead Director, and chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee meet to discuss the performance
and contributions of each director. As part of the nomination process, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the performance
and contributions of each director and evaluates each of the directors to ensure our directors continue to possess the necessary
skills and experience to effectively oversee the Company. On occasion, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not renominated
a director based on this individual director evaluation process.
 
Board and Committee
Information
 
The Board currently has
twelve directors and the following four committees: Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance. The membership
and the function of each committee are described below.
 
During 2017, the Board
of Directors held five regularly scheduled meetings and two telephonic meetings. Overall attendance at Board and committee meetings
was 98 percent. During 2017, all of our directors attended at least 75 percent of all Board and Committee meetings on which they
served.
 
The Company has a long-standing
policy that directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless extenuating circumstances prevent them
from attending. Eleven directors attended last year’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which constituted all directors who
were members of the Board as of the 2017 Annual Meeting date.

Director Compensation and Stock Ownership Guidelines
 
Director Compensation Philosophy and Elements
 
The Nominating and Governance Committee periodically
receives reports on the status of Board compensation in relation to other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending
to the Board changes in compensation for non-employee directors. In developing its recommendations, the Committee is guided by
the following goals:
 


 
●
Compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a company of 3M’s size and scope;

 
 
 

 
●
A significant portion of the total compensation should be paid in common stock to align directors’ interests with
    the long-term interests of stockholders; and

 
 
 

 
●
The structure of the compensation should be simple and transparent.

 
The Nominating and Governance Committee works
with an independent compensation consultant to support its objectives of maintaining a reasonable and appropriate program. For
2017, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. provided the Committee with expert advice on the compensation of non-employee directors,
in addition to analyzing market data on director compensation at the same peer group of 18 companies approved by the Compensation
Committee for evaluating Named Executive Officer compensation. Neither the Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee
has any arrangement with any other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the amount or form of
director compensation.
 
Our director program is comprised of a mix of
cash and equity that is intended to approximate the peer-group median mix. Our directors’ overall target total direct compensation
is consistent with 3M’s size and market-capitalization value relative to its peers. In addition, our hold-until-termination
requirement on equity has resulted in ownership levels that are relatively high versus our peers. For more information on the peer
group, please see the section entitled “Executive Peer Group” beginning on page 46 of this Proxy Statement. Non-employee
directors’ compensation includes the following compensation elements:
 
Annual
Compensation — In May 2017, the Nominating and Governance Committee considered a board compensation study prepared
by Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. After reviewing that study, the Committee recommended and the Board approved an increase of
$10,000 in the annual compensation for non-employee directors from $285,000 to $295,000, effective January 1, 2017. The annual
cash retainer was increased $5,000 (from $125,000 to $130,000). The annual stock retainer was also increased $5,000 (from $160,000
to $165,000). Approximately 44 percent of the annual compensation (or $130,000) is payable in cash in four quarterly installments
and approximately 56 percent of the annual compensation (or $165,000) is payable in common stock after the Annual Meeting. In
addition, the chair of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual fee of $25,000 and the chair of the Compensation Committee
receives an additional annual fee of $20,000. The chairs of the Finance and Nominating and Governance Committees each receive
additional annual fee of $20,000 (an increase of $5,000). The Lead Director receives an additional annual fee of $30,000. There
are no meeting fees. In lieu of the cash fees, a director may elect to receive common stock of the Company. Non-employee directors
may also voluntarily defer all or part of their annual cash fees or stock awards until they cease to be members of the Board.
 
Deferred
Stock — For directors who have elected to defer their annual stock awards or annual cash fees into a common stock
equivalents account (“Deferred Stock”), the Company credits their accounts with a number of 3M common stock equivalents
(including fractional share equivalents) equal to the number of actual shares of 3M common stock which could have been purchased
with such deferred amounts on the first day of the calendar quarter, using the closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on
the last business day immediately preceding such date. In addition, on each payment date for dividends on 3M common stock, the
Company credits to the directors’ accounts a number of 3M common stock equivalents having a value equal to the dividend,
determined by using the closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on the sixth business day preceding the dividend record date.
The Deferred Stock is fully vested upon grant but does not have voting rights. Appropriate adjustments to the amount of Deferred
Stock shall be made to the accounts for stock splits, stock dividends, merger, consolidation, payment of dividends other than
in cash, and similar circumstances affecting 3M common stock. The Deferred Stock will be distributed in 3M common stock to non-employee
directors beginning on January 1 of the year following the year in which they leave the Board, either in a lump sum or in up to
ten annual installments pursuant to their deferral elections.
 
All Other
Compensation — The column below showing “All Other Compensation” includes the incremental cost of complimentary
products and matching gifts. The non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s matching gift program
on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year in contributions
by the director to eligible institutions of higher education.

awards outstanding at year end.

gifts. Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the Company’s matching gift program on the same terms as 3M
employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year in contributions by the director to
eligible institutions of higher education.
 
Reasonableness of Non-Employee Director Compensation
 
As described above, our philosophy on director
compensation is to pay directors fairly for work required in a company of our size and complexity, make a significant portion of
the total compensation equity-based to align directors’ interests with those of our stockholders and structure compensation
in a simple and transparent manner. We believe that the application of this philosophy has resulted in a non-employee director
compensation program that reflects best-in-class design with the following provisions:
 


 
●
Retainer-only cash compensation with no fees for attending meetings that are an expected part of board
    service.

 
 
 

 
●
Additional retainers for special roles having greater responsibilities, such as Lead Director and committee chairs, to
    recognize the incremental additional time and effort required.

 
 
 

 
●
Equity delivered in the form of full-value shares, where annual grants are based on a competitive fixed-value formula
    and immediate vesting helps avoid director entrenchment.

 
 
 

 
●
A requirement to retain the stock portion of annual compensation issued on or after October 1, 2007, until termination
    from Board service, which includes net after-tax shares attributable to current payments and pre-tax shares attributable to
    deferrals.

 
 
 

 
●
Flexible voluntary deferral provisions and no material benefits or perquisites.

 
 
 

 
●
Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting, includes a $600,000 annual compensation
    limit on all forms of compensation for non-employee directors.

AUDIT
COMMITTEE
MATTERS
 
Proposal No. 2: Ratification
of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2018
 
The Audit Committee is directly
responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of all fees), retention, and oversight of the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm (“Independent Accounting Firm”) retained to perform the audit of our
financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting.
 
The Audit Committee has appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to serve as 3M’s Independent Accounting Firm for 2018. PwC has been 3M’s
Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to that, 3M’s Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand from 1975
until its merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policy, audit partners are subject to rotation
requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company. For lead and concurring
audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of
the Company’s lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the Audit Committee
and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Committee and with management.
 
The Audit Committee annually
reviews PwC’s independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committee’s determination of whether to retain
PwC or engage another firm as our Independent Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers, among
other things:
 


 
●
PwC’s historical and recent performance on the 3M audit, including
    input from those 3M employees with substantial contact with PwC throughout the year about PwC’s quality of service provided,
    and the independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit
    team;

 
 
 

 
●
an analysis of PwC’s known legal risks and significant proceedings;

 
 
 

 
●
external data relating to audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) reports on PwC and its peer firms; 

 
 
 

 
●
PwC’s independence; 

 
 
 

 
●
the appropriateness of PwC’s fees, on both an absolute basis and as compared to its
    peer firms; 

 
 
 

 
●
PwC’s tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity with our global operations
    and businesses, accounting policies and practices and internal control over financial reporting; and 

 
 
 

 
●
PwC’s capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our global
    operations, including the Company’s phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning system on a worldwide basis
    over the next several years.

 
Based on this evaluation, the
Audit Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to retain
PwC to serve as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2018.
 
We are asking our stockholders
to ratify the selection of PwC as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2018. Although ratification is not required by our Bylaws
or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance.
If the selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another Independent
Accounting Firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a different Independent Accounting
Firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
 
PwC representatives are expected
to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.
 


RECOMMENDATION
    OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

 


The Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the ratification of the appointment of
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2018. Proxies solicited
    by the Board of Directors will be voted “FOR” ratification unless a stockholder indicates otherwise in voting
    the proxy.

Audit Committee Report
 
The Audit Committee oversees
the Company’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The management of the Company is responsible
for (i) the preparation of complete and accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”)
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial
reporting principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and laws and regulations,
and (iii) an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent Accounting Firm is responsible
for planning and conducting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)
an audit of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and a review of the Company’s quarterly financial
statements and expressing opinions on the Company’s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting based
on the integrated audits.
 
In this context, the Audit Committee
has met and held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of
the Company’s results and the assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee
has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its financial statements, as well as alternative treatments.
Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated
audited financial statements with management and the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Independent
Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the PCAOB’s Auditing Standards on Communications with Audit
Committees, as currently in effect.
 
In addition, the Audit Committee
has reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditor’s independence from the Company and its management.
As part of that review, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements
of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Accounting Firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence,
and the Audit Committee has discussed the Independent Accounting Firm’s independence from the Company.
 
The Audit Committee also has
considered whether the Independent Accounting Firm’s provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the
auditor’s independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company
and its management.
 
The Audit Committee has discussed
with the Company’s Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective
audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel, and representatives
of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations
of the Company’s internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company’s financial reporting and compliance programs.
 
In reliance on the reviews and
discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that
the audited financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2017, for filing with the SEC.

Audit Committee Policy on
Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Accounting Firm
 
The Audit Committee is responsible
for appointing and overseeing the work of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring
its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting Firm.
 
The policy identifies the guiding
principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services to ensure that the Independent Accounting Firm’s
independence is not impaired; describes the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services that may be provided and the non-audit
services that may not be performed; and sets forth the pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. The policy provides
for the general pre-approval of specific types of Audit, Audit-Related and Tax services and a limited fee estimate range for such
services on an annual basis as set forth in the engagement letter with the Independent Accounting Firm. The policy requires specific
pre-approval of all other permitted services. The Independent Accounting Firm is required to report periodically to the Audit Committee
regarding the extent of services provided in accordance with their pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date.
 
The Audit Committee’s
policy delegates to its Chair the authority to address requests for pre-approval of services in certain limited circumstances between
Audit Committee meetings. The chair, in his discretion, must either seek immediate approval by email from the other Audit Committee
members, or report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee for its approval at its next scheduled meeting.
 
The Audit Committee may not
delegate to management the Audit Committee’s responsibility to pre-approve permitted services of the Independent Accounting
Firm.
 
All Audit, Audit-Related, Tax
and All Other services described below were approved by the Audit Committee before services were rendered.
 
Fees of the Independent Accounting
Firm
 
The following table represents
fees billed for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) for the audit of the Company’s
consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by
PwC during those periods.

registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits, comfort letters, consents, and
review of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Audit-related” fees consisted principally of
procedures related to the adoption of new accounting standards in future years, internal control and system audit procedures for
periods prior to the rollout of the ERP system, agreed-upon procedures, employee benefit plan audits, and other attestation services.
“Tax” fees consisted principally of tax compliance services in foreign jurisdictions, assistance with transfer pricing
documentation, assistance with excise tax filings, and advice on foreign and domestic tax related matters. “All Other”
fees consisted of information security vendor assessments, licenses for accounting software, and other permissible services that
do not fall into the three categories listed above.
 
Audit Committee Restrictions
on Hiring Employees of the Independent Accounting Firm
 
The Audit Committee has adopted
restrictions on the hiring by the Company of any PwC partner, director, manager, staff, reviewing actuary, reviewing tax professional,
and any other persons having responsibility for providing audit assurance on any aspect of PwC’s certification of the Company’s
financial statements. Audit assurance includes all work that results in the expression of an opinion on financial statements, including
audits of statutory accounts.

EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION
 
Proposal No. 3: Advisory
Approval of Executive Compensation
 
Section 14A of the Securities
Exchange Act provides our stockholders with the opportunity to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive
officers as described in this Proxy Statement. This is the seventh year that the Company is asking stockholders to vote on this
type of proposal, known as a “say-on-pay” proposal.
 
We believe that our executive
compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is structured to assure that those principles are
implemented. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 9, 2017, approximately 96 percent of the votes cast on this issue
voted to approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers as disclosed in last year’s Proxy Statement.
Although the vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee believes this level of approval percentage indicates that our stockholders
strongly support our core compensation principles and our executive compensation program, and we believe our stockholders as a
whole should support them as well.
 
Thus, the Company is submitting
to stockholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:
 
“RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve,
on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant
to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis,
the accompanying compensation tables and related narrative).”
 
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis portion
of this Proxy Statement, 3M delivered another year of strong financial performance in 2017. These results reflected the strong
performance of the Company’s leadership team, including the Named Executive Officers, which impacted their annual and long-term
incentive compensation earned during 2017.
 
While the Board of Directors
and the Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on this proposal when making future decisions
regarding executive compensation, the vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in nature. The Company currently
holds advisory votes on the compensation of named executive officers annually. Accordingly, the next such advisory vote is expected
to occur at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
 


RECOMMENDATION
    OF THE BOARD

 


The
    Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies
    solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted “FOR” this proposal unless a stockholder indicates otherwise
    in voting the proxy.

SECTION
    I: Executive Summary

 
2017 Financial Performance and Business Highlights
 
For 3M, 2017 was a year
of strong financial performance achieved through solid growth and disciplined execution. Given the impact that the U.S. Tax Reform
Legislation and a related $600 million pension contribution had on the Company’s 2017 financial performance, our results
are shown below both as determined in accordance with GAAP (to the extent applicable) and excluding the impact of certain items
stemming from the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation and 3M’s related pension contribution.

this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation of earnings per share, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion to our results for
the most directly comparable financial measures as reported under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
and the calculation of return on invested capital as shown here.
 
We believe that our ability
to deliver consistent results over time is reflected in our total stockholder return, which was in the top half of our executive
compensation peer group for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ending on December 31, 2017. For additional information, see
“Total Stockholder Return” on page 41 of this Proxy Statement.
 
Other noteworthy accomplishments
include the following:
 


 
●
Enhanced 3M’s array of safety products and solutions through the acquisition of Scott Safety, making us even more relevant to our customers worldwide; 

 
 
 

 
●
Awarded a record total of 4,168 patents from patent offices around the world in 2017, including 708 patents granted to 3M by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which brings to more than 113,000 the total number of patents awarded to 3M in its corporate history;

 
 
 

 
●
Strengthened our portfolio going forward by completing or announcing the divestiture of all or substantially all of four businesses that no longer align with our strategic objectives: identity management, electronic monitoring, tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions for the telecommunications industry; 

 
 
 

 
●
Recognized by
    Ethisphere® as one of the World’s Most™ Ethical Companies® for the fifth
    consecutive year;

 
 
 

 
●
Nearly completed the rollout of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in West Europe, and successfully started the initial deployment in the United States; 

 
 
 

 
●
Over 100 consecutive years of paying dividends to stockholders; and 

 
 
 

 
●
Returned $4.9 billion to stockholders via dividends and gross share repurchases.

 
Factors Creating Alignment Between Pay and
Performance
 
3M’s executive compensation
program is designed to maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and executive compensation by tying incentive
compensation to the achievement of performance metrics that we believe increase the Company’s long-term value. For 2017,
highlights of the program include:
 


 
●
A large portion of each executive’s target Total Direct Compensation (cash plus long-term incentives) is performance-based, varying from 90 percent for Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin to a range of 79-85 percent for the other Named Executive Officers; and 

 
 
 

 
●
The incentive compensation opportunities provided to the Named Executive Officers utilize multiple performance-based metrics focused primarily on revenue and earnings performance, increase in 3M’s common stock price, efficient use of capital, and free cash flow conversion.

Impact of Company Performance on Incentive
Compensation and Real Pay Delivery
 
One objective of our incentive compensation program
is to align our Named Executive Officer’s real pay delivery with performance. The Company’s performance directly impacted
incentive compensation pay outcomes for our Named Executive Officers as follows:
 
2017 Annual Incentive Compensation
 
For the Named Executive Officers paid on the
basis of the Company’s overall performance, the 2017 annual incentive compensation payout (before any adjustment for individual
performance) was 130 percent of the target amount. The payouts reflect our solid performance against the goals established for
2017 (as shown below) and were calculated excluding the impact of the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation and 3M’s related pension
contribution, gains associated with the divestiture of the Electronic Monitoring and Identity Management businesses, and costs
associated with special actions.
 


 
●
Local currency sales achieved 104 percent of plan; 

 
 
 

 
●
3M economic profit achieved 109 percent of plan; and 

 
 
 

 
●
3M’s 2017 economic profit represented 115 percent of its 2016 results.

 
Performance Share Awards (Long-Term Incentive
Compensation)
 
The number of shares delivered pursuant to the
performance share awards issued to the Named Executive Officers for the 2015-2017 performance period equaled 99 percent of the
target number of shares awarded.

After considering the appreciation
in the price of 3M’s common stock over the three-year performance period, the value of the 3M shares delivered to the Named
Executive Officers in settlement of these awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE
for December 29, 2017) equaled 146 percent of the value of the target number of performance shares subject to such awards (determined
using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for March 2, 2015, the initial grant date of 2015 performance
share awards).
 
Stock and Long-Term Incentive
Compensation
 
The performance of 3M’s
stock has a material impact on the amount of compensation actually realized by our Named Executive Officers. Our stock ownership
guidelines require covered executives, including the Named Executive Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a value exceeding
a specified multiple of their base salary. If the market price of 3M’s stock declines, so does the value of the stock they
own.

Table of Contents

Similarly, stock options
and other long-term incentive awards held by our Named Executive Officers increase or decrease in value along with increases and
decreases in the value of 3M’s common stock. The stock options and other long-term incentive compensation granted to our
Named Executive Officers in years prior to 2017 increased in value during 2017 as the closing price for a share of the Company’s
common stock on the NYSE increased from $178.57 on December 30, 2016, to $235.37 on December 29, 2017.

As reflected in the graphs

2017 Say on Pay
 
In 2017, approximately 96
percent of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in
last year’s Proxy Statement. Although the vote was non-binding, the Committee believes this level of approval indicates that
stockholders strongly support our executive compensation programs and policies. The Committee will consider the results of this
year’s say-on-pay proposal, as well as feedback from our stockholders, when making future executive compensation decisions.

our investor outreach efforts, please refer to the section entitled “Stockholder Outreach and Engagement” on page 17
of this Proxy Statement.
 
Noteworthy Compensation Actions for 2017 and
Early 2018
 
During 2017 and the first
two months of 2018, the Company took a number of actions that were intended to create a more unified program structure that applies
to all eligible employees throughout the organization and simplify the design and administration of our compensation programs.
Effective as of January 1, 2017, to encourage performance that exceeds targets and better align incentive compensation opportunities
between those employees compensated on the basis of corporate performance and those employees compensated based on the performance
of one or more businesses, we adjusted our approach to setting financial performance targets for the Annual Incentive Plan. In
addition, the Company took the actions listed below, effective as of January 1, 2018.
 


 
●
Increased the payout slopes and further adjusted our approach to setting financial performance targets for the Annual Incentive Plan. These changes are intended, among other things, to better align payout opportunities with those of the Company’s executive compensation peer group by strengthening “rewards” for participants when plan targets are exceeded and consequences when they are not.

●
Eliminated the Company’s historical practice of granting prorated performance share awards to newly appointed or promoted members of the Company’s senior management (which generally consists of approximately 100 of our top employees), and aligned the retirement vesting provisions of performance share awards for newly appointed executives with those provided to other executives who did not receive prorated grants.

 
Compensation Policies and Practices
 
Our compensation program is designed to provide
appropriate performance incentives and avoid compensation practices that do not promote the interests of our stockholders.
 



WE
    DO
 
WE
    DO NOT

 
 
 



        Maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and our executive officers’ compensation by having a majority of
        Total Direct Compensation consist of performance-based compensation.
 

        Conduct an annual assessment for the purpose of identifying and mitigating significant economic and reputational risks in the design
        of our incentive compensation programs.
 

        Have a comprehensive clawback policy.
 

        Use an independent compensation consultant retained by, and reporting directly to, the Committee.
 

        Limit the number and amount of executive perquisites.
 

        Prohibit our executive officers from hedging or pledging 3M common stock.
 

        Maintain robust stock ownership guidelines applicable to all of our executive officers.
 

        Conduct competitive benchmarking to align executive compensation with the market.

 

 Have employment, severance, or change in control agreements with any of our executive officers.
 

        Provide tax gross-ups on executive perquisites.
 

        Have agreements that would provide automatic “single-trigger” accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise
        tax gross-up payments to any of our executive officers upon a change in control.
 

        Provide dividends or dividend equivalents on unearned equity awards.
 

        Reprice stock options without the approval of 3M stockholders, except for “anti-dilution” adjustments (such as adjustments
        in connection with a stock split, spinoff, etc.)



 


SECTION II: How We Determine Compensation


 
Principles of Our Executive Compensation Program
 
3M believes that the compensation
of its executives should be closely tied to the performance of the Company, so that their interests are aligned with the interests
of long-term 3M stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the following core principles provide a framework for the Company’s
executive compensation program:
 


 
●
Total Direct Compensation should be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their highest levels, reward individual contributions that improve the Company’s ability to deliver outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for building long-term stockholder value;

 
 
 

 
●
The portion of Total Direct Compensation that is performance-based and is, therefore, at risk should increase with the level of an individual’s responsibility; 

 
 
 

 
●
The program should balance incentives for delivering outstanding long-term, sustainable performance against the potential to encourage inappropriate risk-taking; 

 
 
 

 
●
The metrics and targets for earning performance-based incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to, increasing stockholder value over the long term; and 

 
 
 

 
●
A significant portion of each executive’s personal net worth should be tied to the value of 3M common stock as further motivation to build long-term stockholder value and mitigate the risk of inappropriate risk-taking.

Elements of Target 2017 Total Direct Compensation
 
The illustration below and the discussion that follows
show how the target Total Direct Compensation of the Named Executive Officers was apportioned among base salary, annual incentives,
performance share awards and stock options for 2017, and how these elements relate to the strategic business goals of the Company.

3M pays each of its executives a base salary in cash
on a monthly basis. The amount of this base salary is reviewed at least annually and does not vary with the performance of the
Company. Base salaries are designed to compensate the executives for their normal day-to-day responsibilities, and it is the only
component of their compensation that is considered to be fixed rather than variable in nature.

3M provides its executives with annual incentive
compensation through plans that are intended to align a significant portion of their Total Cash Compensation with the financial
performance of the Company and its business units. Each executive is assigned a target amount of annual incentive compensation
as part of his or her target Total Cash Compensation, but the amount of annual incentive compensation actually paid depends on
the performance of 3M and its relevant business units as well as each executive’s individual performance.
 
3M’s AIP offers eligible employees an opportunity
to earn short-term incentive compensation based on three performance metrics, which were weighted for 2017 as indicated above.
All 2017 performance targets for our Corporate AIP plan were set at or above 2016 results.
 
The actual amount paid to an eligible employee for
a particular year may range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the employee’s target amount for that year, depending on the
performance of the Company and its business units compared to the performance goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The
amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an eligible employee also may be increased (up to 30 percent), reduced or eliminated
entirely based on the employee’s individual performance during that year. Individual performance takes into account both
quantitative (financial results, for example) and qualitative (market and economic circumstances, for example) factors. In no event,
however, may the total amount paid to an eligible employee exceed 200 percent of the employee’s target amount for the year.

Table of Contents

In determining the amount of annual incentive compensation
paid to a Named Executive Officer, the Named Executive Officer’s individual performance is considered based upon the annual
performance evaluation that Mr. Thulin, assisted by 3M’s Senior Vice President, Human Resources, and other Company employees,
completed for each Named Executive Officer (other than himself) and the annual performance evaluation that the Compensation Committee
(acting through its Chairman) completed for Mr. Thulin. These performance evaluations are done according to 3M’s overall
performance assessment and management processes, which involve setting annual financial and non-financial goals and objectives
for each individual and then assessing the individual’s overall performance against these goals and objectives at the end
of the year. While the annual incentive compensation earned by eligible 3M employees generally is determined under the AIP, the
annual incentive compensation earned during 2017 by the senior executives whose compensation is decided by the Committee (including
all of the Named Executive Officers) was determined under the Executive Plan approved by 3M’s stockholders at the 2007 Annual
Meeting. A total of 18 senior executives participated in this Executive Plan during 2017. The Executive Plan, which is intended
to provide compensation that is exempt from the $1 million annual deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
and similar state laws, provides performance-based compensation for which the performance goal is the Company’s Adjusted
Net Income.
 
Assuming the Company meets the Adjusted Net Income
goal, the Executive Plan provides the Committee with discretion to determine the amount of annual incentive compensation paid to
3M’s Named Executive Officers and its other senior executives. The Executive Plan establishes a maximum amount of annual
incentive compensation that may be earned by each covered executive for a year (a percentage of the Company’s Adjusted Net
Income for such year) and then the Committee utilizes this discretion to pay each covered executive less than this maximum amount
based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since the Executive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Committee has rarely used this
discretion to pay a covered executive (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive
would have received had he or she been participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance multiplier).

3M provides long-term incentive compensation to its
executives through an incentive plan approved by the Company’s stockholders. This is a typical omnibus-type plan that authorizes
the Committee to grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares,
and other stock awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company provides its executives with this long-term
incentive compensation based on 3M common stock in order to effectively motivate such executives to build long-term stockholder
value.
 
In determining the initial target grant value of
the stock options and performance shares provided to our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considers the individual
performance of our Named Executive Officers using the performance evaluations described under “Annual Incentive” above.
 
Our Named Executive Officers also may receive special
equity awards on an ad hoc basis as new hires or for recognition and retention, promotions, or other purposes.
 
Benefits and Perquisites
 
Our Named Executive Officers participate in the same
health care, disability, life insurance, pension, and 401(k) benefit plans available to most of the Company’s U.S. employees.
 
They are also eligible to receive certain additional
benefits and perquisites that are provided for the convenience (financial planning assistance, for example), financial security
(nonqualified deferred compensation plans and premiums for additional life insurance coverage, for example), or personal security
(travel on corporate aircraft and home security equipment/monitoring, for example) of the executives.
 
Subject to a few exceptions (travel on corporate
aircraft, for example), 3M generally provides these additional benefits and perquisites to all of our executives on a consistent
basis, although the type of additional life

insurance coverage provided varies based on the date
the executive was first appointed to an executive position. Individuals first appointed to an executive position on or before August
31, 2003, receive additional life insurance coverage that is provided through a whole life insurance policy or a universal life
insurance policy. Individuals first appointed on or after September 1, 2003, receive group term life insurance coverage.
 
These additional benefits are described in the All
Other Compensation Table. No tax gross-ups are provided on any of these additional benefits and perquisites. The entire program
applied to approximately 100 members of senior management during 2017, including all of the Named Executive Officers.
 
Competitive Pay
 
We compete for executive talent in a global market.
In order to ensure that we are providing Total Direct Compensation that is competitive, the Committee annually conducts a rigorous
benchmarking process with the help of its independent compensation consultant, FW Cook. During this process, the Committee considers
available pay data for two peer groups: an executive peer group and a survey peer group.
 
Executive Peer Group
 
For 2017, the executive peer group consisted of the
companies identified below (which remained the same as in the previous year, except for the replacement of Tyco International with
Johnson Controls International plc discussed below), as recommended by the Committee’s independent compensation consultant
and approved by the Committee. The companies in this executive peer group were selected because (1) their performance was monitored
regularly by the same market analysts who monitor the performance of 3M (investment peers), and/or (2) they met criteria based
on similarity of their business and pay models, market capitalization (based on an eight-quarter rolling average), and annual revenues.

The Committee periodically reviews the composition
of the executive peer group to determine whether any changes are appropriate. Following the completion of Tyco International’s
combination with Johnson Controls and its related restructuring, the Committee replaced Tyco International with Johnson Controls
International plc in January 2017, as recommended by the Committee’s independent compensation consultant.
 
The Company receives pay data and information on
the executive compensation practices at the companies in 3M’s executive peer group from Aon Hewitt and FW Cook.
 
Survey Peer Group
 
For 2017, there were approximately 170 comparator
companies in the survey peer group. Although the number and identity of the companies varies from year to year and from survey
to survey, each of the companies included in the survey peer group had annual revenue exceeding $10 billion. All of the companies
in the survey peer group also participate in one or more executive compensation surveys obtained from three consulting firms (Aon
Hewitt, FW Cook, and Willis Towers Watson). Pay data for the survey peer group is statistically regressed to recognize the different
sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual revenues) as compared to the size of 3M. The Committee does not review the identity
of the companies in the survey peer group.
 
How the Committee Uses Competitive Pay Data
 
The Committee considers the pay data from the Peer
Groups as a reference point when establishing the target Total Cash Compensation and the initial target value of long-term incentive
compensation to be provided to our executives in any given year. For each executive, the Committee generally tries to set such
amounts at or near the median for the corresponding items of compensation provided to similarly situated executives in the executive
peer group. In situations where the Committee believes that there is insufficient market data for one or more positions, the Committee
starts with the median amount for a similar position and adjusts that amount up or down (generally not more than 15 percent) to
arrive at a number that it uses as the “median” for that position. The final target amounts established by the Committee
for each executive may vary (generally between 80 and 120 percent of the relevant median) based on individual circumstances. When
setting the target amounts for any individual executive, the Committee may consider the breadth and complexity of the executive’s
duties and responsibilities, the scores assigned to the executive for his or her leadership behaviors (e.g., customer focus, strategic
mindset, operational leadership), the financial and operational performance of the business activities for which the executive
is responsible, experience and time in their current position, internal pay equity, individual performance, and such other factors
as the Committee determines to be appropriate. The pay data for the survey peer group is used by the Committee to assess the reasonableness
of the benchmarking results for each executive position benchmarked, helping to ensure that the Company’s compensation objectives
are being met.
 
The Committee also uses information on the executive
compensation practices at companies in the executive peer group when considering design changes to the Company’s executive
compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this information from the Peer Groups enables the Committee to
create better alignment between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can attract and retain high-performing
executive leaders.
 
Tally Sheets
 
The Committee periodically reviews a report comparing
the amounts of compensation actually received by the Company’s Named Executive Officers to the amounts reported in its annual
proxy statement and summarizing the compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the event of the termination of their
employment under various circumstances. Reviewing this report helps the Committee better understand the Company’s potential
obligations to the Named Executive Officers following the termination of their employment. It also helps the Committee better assess
the risk of any of the Named Executive Officers leaving the Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient
retention incentives.
 
Tax Considerations
 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (“Section 162(m)”), disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in excess of $1
million to “covered employees” (generally, a company’s chief executive officer and its three other highest paid
executive officers other than its chief financial officer). Prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation, there was an
exception to this $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation if certain requirements set forth in Section 162(m)
and the applicable regulations were met. The Committee has historically designed its compensation programs based on its belief
that a substantial portion of the compensation payable to NEOs should be based on the achievement of
 


2018
    Proxy Statement |

Table of Contents

performance-based targets or otherwise be designed
with the intent that such compensation qualifies as deductible performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). As a result,
annual incentive compensation and certain equity-based compensation arrangements granted to our covered employees were intended
to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m).
 
Effective for taxable
years beginning after December 31, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation amended Section 162(m) to eliminate the exception
for performance-based compensation and expand the definition of “covered employee” to include a company’s
chief financial officer and certain individuals who were covered employees in years other than the then-current taxable year.
Although some transition relief may apply with respect to compensation paid pursuant to certain contracts in effect as of
November 2, 2017, ambiguities in the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation prevent the Committee from being able to definitively
ascertain what compensation payable to the covered employees in excess of $1 million, if any, will be deductible in future
years. Interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other factors beyond the control of
the Committee can affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive
officers who are considered covered employees for purposes of Section 162(m) will be deductible.
 
The Committee will continue to consider tax implications
(including the potential lack of deductibility under Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions, but reserves the right
to make compensation decisions based on other factors if the Committee believes it is in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders to do so. The Committee also reserves the right to make changes or amendments to existing compensation programs,
including changes or amendments that are intended to modify or eliminate aspects of such arrangements that were intended to take
advantage of the former exception to Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation but that the Committee no longer believes
are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

means the total of an individual’s base salary and annual incentive compensation.

TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION
 
means the total of an individual’s Total Cash Compensation plus the compensation value of their annual long-term incentive compensation awards (which is based on their grant date fair value as measured under accounting standards).

 



SECTION III: How We Paid Our Named
    Executive Officers in 2017


 
2017 Base Salary and Target Total Cash Compensation
 
The Committee considers changes in the base salaries
and target Total Cash Compensation of the Named Executive Officers at least annually. As part of its normal process to progress
senior executives to a level of compensation that is commensurate with their responsibilities, the Committee also periodically
considers adjustments to the base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation of senior executives whose rate of pay is set below
the market median. All adjustments are made only after considering the most recent compensation data available to the Committee
for executives with similar responsibilities at companies in the Peer Groups, each individual’s place in the salary range
for his or her position, and the individual’s job performance.
 
In February 2017, the Committee approved (and in
the case of Mr. Thulin, the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified) the increases in the base salaries and target
Total Cash Compensation shown below for the Named Executive Officers following completion of their annual performance evaluations.
Mr. Gangestad’s increase was based on a combination of strong operational performance and market adjustment to bring his
target Total Cash Compensation closer to the median provided to executives serving in similar positions at companies in the executive
peer group.

As a result of these increases, the target Total
Cash Compensation of these Named Executive Officers ranged from 98 percent to 114 percent of the median value of the corresponding
compensation provided to executives with similar responsibilities at companies in the executive peer group.
 
In June 2017, the Committee approved the increases
in the base salary and target Total Cash Compensation shown below in connection with Mr. Roman’s appointment to Chief Operating
Officer and Executive Vice President and Mr. Shin’s appointment to Vice Chair and Executive Vice President. The increases
were intended to better align the target Total Cash Compensation of each executive with the breadth of the responsibilities that
accompany their new roles.

As a result of these increases, each of the executives’
target Total Cash Compensation was at or near the median value of the corresponding compensation provided to executives with similar
responsibilities at companies in the executive peer group.
 
2017 Annual Incentive
 
During 2017, the Committee provided the Named Executive
Officers with the opportunity to earn short-term incentive compensation under the Executive Plan. Each Named Executive Officer’s
target annual incentive for the year was equal to the difference between his or her target Total Cash Compensation and annual base
salary. Each of the Named Executive Officers was assigned to an appropriate business unit (the entire Company, in some cases) established
under the AIP for the purpose of measuring business performance during 2017 and converting that performance into a payout determined
in accordance with the terms of the AIP. While none of the Named Executive Officers are covered by the AIP, the Committee rarely
uses its discretion under the Executive Plan to pay the covered executives (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other
than the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been participating in the AIP (including the individual performance
multiplier).
 
The amounts payable under the AIP for 2017 were based
on the following performance results for the Company and, as applicable, the respective business units to which the Named Executive
Officers were assigned for all or part of the year:

Since the Company satisfied the Executive Plan’s
performance objective by earning Adjusted Net Income of $5.6 billion for 2017, the plan authorized the Committee to approve payments
of annual incentive compensation to each Named Executive Officer equal to a maximum of one-quarter of one percent of such Adjusted
Net Income ($14 million), subject to the Committee’s negative discretion to pay each covered executive any amount less than
this maximum based on such factors as it deems relevant, including the goals set forth under the AIP. At its meeting in February
2018 and consistent with its past practice, the Committee approved (and with respect to Mr. Thulin, the independent members of
the Board of Directors ratified) a payment to each executive equal to the amount such executive would have received had he been
participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance multiplier).

Long-Term Incentives — 2017 Annual Grants
 
After considering the most recent long-term incentive
compensation data available from companies in the Peer Groups and after taking into account its evaluation of their individual
performance during 2016, the Committee approved (and in the case of Mr. Thulin, the independent members of the Board of Directors
ratified) the following target compensation values for the Named Executive Officers’ 2017 long-term incentive compensation
awards. For ease of comparison, the following table also shows the target compensation values of the Named Executive Officers’
2016 long-term incentive compensation awards.

Consistent with market practices at companies in
the Peer Groups, during 2017, the Committee chose to deliver one-half of the initial estimated value of the annual long-term incentive
compensation awards provided to 3M’s Named Executive Officers in the form of stock options and the remaining one-half in
the form of performance shares.
 
2017 Stock Options
 
Stock options granted to the Named Executive Officers
in 2017 as part of their long-term incentive compensation have the following features:
 


 
●
an exercise price equal to the closing
    price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the date of grant; 

 
 
 

 
●
a ratable three-year vesting schedule; and

 
 
 

 
●
a maximum term of 10 years.

 
2017 Performance Share Awards
 
Performance shares awarded in 2017 will result in
the issuance of actual shares of 3M common stock to 3M’s Named Executive Officers if the Company achieves certain financial
goals over the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be issued for each 2017 performance
share is linked to the Company’s performance as measured by the criteria of Earnings Per Share Growth (20 percent weighting),
Relative Organic Volume Growth (40 percent weighting), Return on Invested Capital (20 percent weighting), and Free Cash Flow Conversion
(20 percent weighting). These performance criteria were selected because they are aligned with 3M’s operating plan and the
financial objectives communicated to stockholders and the Committee believes that they are important
 


2018
    Proxy Statement |

Table of Contents

drivers of long-term stockholder value. Attainment
of these four independent performance criteria is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year measurement
period, with each year weighted as follows: 2017 — 50 percent; 2018 — 30 percent; and 2019 — 20 percent. However,
the formulas by which the Company’s performance is measured do not change over the three-year performance period.
 
The actual number of shares of 3M common stock
that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2019, may be anywhere from 0 percent
to 200 percent of the target number of performance shares awarded, depending on the performance of the Company during the performance
period. However, an executive may forfeit all or a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain employed by the Company
throughout the three-year performance period.
 
For awards tied to the achievement of performance
goals over the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, the Committee approved the following formulas for determining the number of shares of
3M common stock to be delivered for each performance share awarded, with the total number of shares actually delivered being the
sum of the number of shares earned as a result of the Company’s achievement of each of the four financial goals. In the event
that the Company’s performance as measured by any of these performance criteria falls between any of the percentages listed
below, the number of shares of 3M common stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.

The above formulas are not a prediction of
how 3M will perform during the years 2017 through 2019 or any other period in the future. The sole purpose of these formulas, which
were approved by the Committee in February 2017, is to establish a method for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock
to be delivered for the performance share awards described above. 3M is not providing any guidance, nor updating any prior guidance,
of its future performance with the disclosure of these formulas, and you are cautioned not to rely on these formulas as a prediction
of 3M’s future performance.
 
Long-Term Incentives — All Outstanding Performance Share
Awards
 
The Company’s annual award cycle and three-year
performance periods result in an overlap of awards. For example, the performance goals for 2017 performance share awards relate
to the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Similarly, the performance goals for 2016 performance share awards relate to the years 2016,
2017, and 2018, and so on, as shown below. Performance against the goals established for each award are measured separately for
each calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as shown below in parenthesis. The Committee believes
this structure reduces motivation to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest level rewards only by building
sustainable long-term results.

* The amounts in this column reflect
the number of shares accrued based on, among other things, Worldwide IPI for the 2017 calendar year, as reported by Global Insights
on January 15, 2018. The final number of shares accrued may vary in the event of changes in Worldwide IPI reported by Global Insights.
Due to rounding, the numbers shown in this column may not equal the result obtained by multiplying the Performance Shares Awarded
by the Shares Accrued Per Performance Share Based on 2017 Performance.
 
**  Represents the closing price of a
share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 29, 2017 ($235.37), multiplied by the actual number of shares accrued (before
rounding) based on the Company’s 2017 performance.
 
Although shares of 3M common stock are accrued
annually for each outstanding performance share award, an executive may forfeit all or a portion of the shares otherwise issuable
pursuant to his or her award if he or she does not remain employed by the Company throughout the entire three-year performance
period.
 
Special Retention Grants
 
Given the size and complexity of
3M’s operations and the inherent risks and challenges associated with replacing top performers, the Committee believes
that retaining key leaders who possess deep knowledge of the business is essential to the organization’s future
success. After consulting with its independent compensation consultant and considering the strong performance of Mr.
Gangestad and Mr. Little, as well as their existing compensation packages and other incentives, the Committee approved a
special restricted stock unit award for Mr. Gangestad and Mr. Little with a target grant value of $1,500,000 and $1,200,000,
respectively. Each of the restricted stock unit awards will vest in two equal annual installments on each of December 1,
2020, and December 1, 2022, provided that Mr. Gangestad and Mr. Little remain in employment with 3M through each such
date.

in which the compensation of the Named Executive Officers is determined and the role of the Compensation Committee and its advisors,

SECTION IV: Ways in Which
We Address Risk and Governance

 
Stock Ownership Guidelines
 
The Company maintains robust stock
ownership guidelines that apply to all Section 16 officers of the Company and are designed to increase an executive’s
equity stake in 3M and more closely align his or her financial interests with those of 3M’s stockholders. The following
table shows the stock ownership guideline for each Named Executive Officer and their compliance status as of December 31,
2017:

* In accordance with the terms of the stock ownership
guidelines, the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each Named Executive Officer in order to maintain compliance
was most recently recalculated as of December 31, 2016, using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for
December 30, 2016. Although each of the Named Executive Officers has until December 31, 2019, to acquire beneficial ownership
of any additional shares required as a result of the recalculation, each individual beneficially owned a sufficient number of
shares on December 31, 2017, to comply with the new ownership levels required.
 
The stock ownership guidelines provide that the
number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each covered executive will be calculated using such executive’s annual
base salary at the time of his or her initial appointment to a Section 16 position and again at the time of a position change from
one multiple level to another multiple level, and the fair market value of 3M common stock at that time. The guidelines also provide
that the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each executive will be recalculated every three years using his
or her annual base salary and the fair market value of 3M common stock at the recalculation date. Pursuant to the terms of the
guidelines, the next periodic recalculation date is scheduled to occur on December 31, 2019.
 
Each covered executive is expected to
attain beneficial ownership of the number of shares of 3M stock determined by the guidelines within five years of his or her
initial appointment to a position covered by the guidelines or a position change from one multiple level to another multiple
level. The guidelines also provide that each covered executive whose required level of ownership increases as a result of a
periodic recalculation will have three years from the recalculation date (or the balance of the five-year period since the
date of their initial appointment or latest position change, if longer) to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional
shares required as a result of the recalculation. However, if a covered executive is not making adequate progress to meet the
required level of ownership within the applicable time period, the guidelines provide that he or she will be required to hold
and not sell a sufficient number of the after-tax 3M shares received upon the next payout of performance shares to be on
track to satisfy the required ownership level.
 
For purposes of these guidelines, shares owned
directly by a covered executive or by members of the covered executive’s immediate family, shares owned indirectly through
a covered executive’s account in the Company’s 401(k) plan or another deferred compensation plan, outstanding shares
of restricted stock owned by a covered executive, and shares represented by outstanding restricted stock units granted to a covered
executive are all considered to be beneficially owned by the covered executive and are counted in determining attainment of the
required beneficial ownership level.
 
For more information concerning the 3M stock
ownership of the Named Executive Officers, see the section entitled “Security Ownership of Management” beginning on
page 75 of this Proxy Statement.

Prohibition of Hedging and Pledging
 
The Company’s stock trading
policies prohibit the Company’s executive officers from (1) purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to
hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company’s common stock, including prepaid variable forward
contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds; (2) engaging in short sales related to the Company’s common
stock; (3) placing standing orders; (4) maintaining margin accounts; and (5) pledging 3M securities as collateral for a
loan. All transactions in 3M securities by directors and executive officers must be pre-cleared with the Company’s
Deputy General Counsel.
 
Policy on Reimbursement of Incentive Payments
(“Clawback”)
 
The Company’s Board of
Directors has adopted a policy requiring the reimbursement of excess incentive compensation payments made to an executive in
the event that 3M is required to make a material restatement of its financial statements. This policy applies to all senior
executives of the Company, including all of the Named Executive Officers. This policy does not require any misconduct on the
part of the covered executive whose excess incentive compensation payment is being reimbursed. As long as the Company is
required to make a material restatement of its financial statements that causes an incentive compensation payout to be higher
than it should have been, the Company may seek to recover the over payment from all affected executives irrespective of
whether their conduct contributed to the need for the restatement. The Company established this policy prior to the passage
of the Dodd-Frank Act, which establishes new requirements for such policies. Upon issuance by the Securities and Exchange
Commission of final implementing regulations for the Dodd-Frank Act’s requirements, the Company will make any changes
to its existing policy as may be required to comply with those regulations.
 
Assessment of Risk Related to Compensation
Programs
 
Following completion of a recent compensation
risk assessment, the Company concluded that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company. In connection with this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its executive and non-executive
compensation programs globally, with particular emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. The scope of the fiscal 2017
risk assessment generally was consistent with that of past years, except that we continued to respond to external market events
by giving heightened attention to plan design, and whether the design, oversight, and controls in place have potential to create
not only financial risk, but reputational risk as well. Based on this assessment, the Company evaluated the primary components
of its compensation plans and practices to identify whether those components, either alone or in combination, properly balanced
compensation opportunities and risk.
 
The Company believes that our
overall cash versus equity pay mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term performance focus, balance of revenue versus
profit focused performance measures, stock ownership guidelines, and “clawback” policy all work together to
provide our employees and executives with incentives to deliver outstanding performance to build long-term stockholder value,
while taking only necessary and prudent risks. In this regard, the Company’s strong ethics and its corporate compliance
systems, which are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate against excessive or inappropriate risk taking. In
addition, our employee sales plans are designed under global guidelines, where oversight of plan terms, administration, and
operation is stronger and governance roles are segregated.
 
The Compensation Committee, with assistance from
its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of FW Cook, reviewed a risk assessment that Mr. Paulin conducted for
the Committee on the Company’s executive compensation policies and practices. Based on its consideration of these assessments,
the Committee concurred with the Company’s determination that none of its compensation policies and practices is reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

(1) The amounts shown reflect 3M matching and
additional automatic contributions under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. All
eligible employees under this plan may receive 3M matching contributions on their pre-tax or Roth 401(k) contributions to the plan
on up to five percent of their eligible pay. Eligible employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, also receive additional automatic
3M retirement income contributions equal to three percent of their eligible pay.
 
(2) The amounts shown reflect 3M matching contributions
under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and its matching contributions is
limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution
plans. The plan permits eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash compensation beyond the contribution
limits established by Federal tax laws, and to receive Company matching contributions similar to the matching contributions provided
under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
 
(3) The amounts shown reflect the amount of
premiums paid by the Company on behalf of each individual with respect to their respective universal life or term life insurance
policies obtained for them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.
 
(4) These amounts reflect fees for personal
financial planning and tax return preparation services paid by the Company on behalf of each individual.
 
(5) This amount reflects the
aggregate incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Thulin’s personal use of corporate aircraft during 2017. This
aggregate incremental cost was calculated by combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of
fuel, landing fees, parking fees, trip preparation fees, en route communication charges, en route navigation charges,
on-board catering, and crew travel expenses. The Compensation Committee requires Mr. Thulin to use the corporate
aircraft for all business and personal travel.
 
(6) This amount reflects the expenses incurred
by 3M from January 1, 2017, through March 31, 2017, for home security equipment and monitoring services at Mr. Thulin’s
personal residence. Mr. Thulin declined such services for the remainder of the year.
 
(7) This amount reflects the aggregate incremental
cost to the Company for Mr. Thulin’s personal use of a Company-provided automobile and local ground transportation. These
costs include lease payments for the vehicle, fuel, insurance premiums, repairs, and maintenance.
 
(8) This amount reflects the aggregate incremental
cost to the Company for meals provided to Mr. Roman’s spouse while accompanying the executive on a business trip at the Company’s
request.
 
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
 
The following table reflects the various equity
and non-equity plan awards granted to the Named Executive Officers during 2017. With the exception of the annual incentive compensation
earned by such Named Executive Officers under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, all of the awards referred to in this table
were granted under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan.

(1) Abbreviations for the Type of Grant: 17PS
= 2017 performance shares; Option = stock options; RSU = restricted stock unit; AIP = annual incentive pay.
 
(2) The amounts shown as the Estimated Future
Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards reflect the target and maximum amounts that may be earned by each individual during
2017 under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. This plan establishes a maximum amount of annual incentive compensation that may
be earned by each covered executive during a plan year (established for purposes of complying with Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code), which for each of the Named Executive Officers was one-quarter of one percent of the Company’s Adjusted Net
Income for 2017, and then permits the Compensation Committee to pay each covered executive less than this maximum amount based
on such factors as it deems relevant. Since the Executive Annual Incentive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Compensation Committee
has rarely used this discretion to pay a covered executive (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same
amount such executive would have received had he or she been participating in the Company’s broad-based Annual Incentive
Plan. (For additional information, see “Annual Incentive” beginning on page 44 of this Proxy Statement).
 
(3) The amounts shown as the Estimated Future
Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards with respect to 2017 performance shares reflect the threshold, target, and maximum number
of shares of 3M common stock that may be earned by each individual as a result of the 2017 performance shares granted to each individual
during 2017 under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The actual number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered as a result
of these performance shares will be determined by the performance of the Company during the three-year performance period of 2017,
2018, and 2019, as measured against four performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee (Relative Organic Volume Growth,
Return on Invested Capital, Earnings Per Share Growth and Free Cash Flow Conversion). For more information on these performance
criteria and the formulas for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock payable as a result of these performance shares,
please refer to the “Long-Term Incentives — 2017 Annual Grants” beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.
 
(4) The amounts shown as the All Other Option
Awards reflect the number of shares of 3M common stock subject to nonqualified stock options granted to each individual during
2017 under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The options granted on February 7, 2017, were part of the Company’s annual
grant of stock options to the approximately 6,000 employees participating in the plan, and they vest in installments of one-third
on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
 
(5) The exercise price for all stock options
granted under the Company’s 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan is set at the closing price at which 3M common stock traded on
the NYSE on the option grant date.
 
(6) The amounts in the Grant Date Fair Value
of Stock and Option Awards column were determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures, and, in the case
of performance share awards, are based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions at the time of grant.
Assumptions made in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 16 to the Company’s audited financial statements
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2018.
 
(7) The amount shown reflects the number of
shares subject to a restricted stock unit award that may be earned by the holder. The restricted stock unit award will vest in
two equal annual installments on each of December 1, 2020, and December 1, 2022, provided that the holder remains in employment
with 3M through such date. For more information on these awards, see “Special Retention Grants” on page 54 of this
Proxy Statement.

* A portion of Mr. Thulin’s
benefits will actually be paid by a pension plan maintained by the Company’s subsidiary in Sweden (based on the years he
was employed in Sweden before transferring to the United States), and the amount paid by this plan in Sweden will reduce the amount
paid by the Employee Retirement Income Plan.
 
The Employee Retirement Income Plan
(“ERIP”) is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by 3M for its eligible employees in the
United States. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees
hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily elected the pension equity formula during the
one-time choice election period in 2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning that
employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009, do not participate in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr.
Thulin, Mr. Gangestad, Mr. Roman, and Mr.  Shin participate under the non-pension equity formula of the ERIP (the
Portfolio I Plan), while Mr.  Little participates under the pension equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Plan).
Retirement benefits under the ERIP are based on an employee’s years of service and average annual earnings during the
employee’s four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for
purposes of the ERIP include base salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the ERIP by the
Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their
employment ends to receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a single lump-sum cash
payment.
 
Under the Portfolio I Plan,
employees earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of their high-four average annual
earnings multiplied by their years of service plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a
Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint
is an average of the Social Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each employee qualifies
for receiving unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire with an
unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively). If the employee’s age and
service at the time of retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively) the
employee also would receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. Mr. Thulin is eligible to retire with unreduced
early retirement benefits. As of March 13, 2018, each of Mr. Roman and Mr. Shin is eligible to retire with reduced early
retirement benefits, with the reduction being equal to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each year that he
retires prior to age 61.
 
Under the Portfolio II Plan,
employees earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment based on their age and accumulated years
of service under the plan. Once their employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their high-four average
annual earnings and added to an amount determined by multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four
average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70 percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in
the year employment ends). The sum of these two amounts is then converted into an annuity payable over the lifetime of the employee
using fixed conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan does not provide any subsidies for early retirement.
 
As a tax-qualified plan,
the ERIP is subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employee’s earnings that may be considered
when determining the benefits earned under the plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The Nonqualified
Pension Plan is designed to provide additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers, affected by these
limits. The amount

 |
3M


 
Table of Contents

of benefits earned under
this Nonqualified Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to earn under the ERIP as a result
of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan are generally paid in the form
of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal
tax laws). Current employees were given a one-time opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive their benefits earned under this
Nonqualified Pension Plan in the form of a life annuity following their retirement, and Mr. Shin elected to receive his benefits
in the form of a life annuity.
 
Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation
 
The following table reflects
the participation during 2017 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by the
Company. The Deferred Compensation Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from
the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive compensation. The Performance Awards Deferred Compensation
Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance
share or performance unit awards under the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess Plan
allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the receipt of a portion of their base salary and annual incentive
compensation. All three plans generally allow the eligible employees to elect to receive payment of their account balances in the
form of either a single lump sum payment or in up to ten annual installments. With the exception of deferrals of performance shares
under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are credited to the amounts deferred under all three plans based
on the returns paid on the investment funds available to participants in 3M’s qualified 401(k) plan or a fixed rate of return
based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each participant). Earnings are credited to the deferrals of performance shares
under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan based on the return on shares of 3M common stock, including reinvested
dividends.

FOOTNOTES TO 2017 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
TABLE
 
(1) With the exception
of the amounts contributed by Mr. Thulin and Mr. Roman from the payout of their performance share awards for the 2014-2016 performance
period and by Mr. Little from the payout of his annual incentive earned during 2016, all amounts contributed by these individuals
during 2017 have been included in the Summary Compensation Table as Salary, Stock Awards, or Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation
earned in 2015, 2016, or 2017. The Summary Compensation Table does not reflect any portion of the contributions from the payout
of Mr. Thulin’s and Mr. Roman’s performance share awards for the 2014-2016 performance period because those awards
were granted in 2014.
 
(2) All amounts contributed
by the Company on behalf of these individuals during 2017 are included in the “All Other Compensation” column of the
Summary Compensation Table.
 
(3) None of these amounts
are included in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation earned in 2017, since none of the Company’s nonqualified deferred
compensation plans provide above-market or preferential earnings.
 
(4) Includes the following
amounts that were reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for prior years: Mr. Thulin — $16,175,883; Mr. Gangestad
— $508,185; Mr. Little — $0; Mr. Roman — $398,994; and Mr. Shin — $669,347.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
in Control
 
As reflected in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers
nor does it have any severance or change in control plans or arrangements that would provide severance benefits to any of the Named
Executive Officers in the event of the termination of their employment or a change in control of the Company. We also do not have
any agreements that would provide automatic “single-trigger” accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax
gross-up payments to any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the Company. However, certain of
the Company’s executive compensation and benefit plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers)
with certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination of their employment or upon a change in control
of the Company. The terms applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are described below. Payments
or benefits under other plans and arrangements that are generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated
employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not described, including (a) accrued base salary; (b) annual
incentive earned with respect to completed performance periods; (c) retiree welfare benefits provided to substantially all of the
Company’s U.S. employees, including retiree medical benefits; (d) distribution of vested account balances under the Company’s
qualified 401(k) plan; (e) accrued pension benefits under the Company’s defined benefit pension plans payable following an
employee’s retirement or other termination of employment (the amounts of these benefits earned by the Named Executive Officers
are reported in the 2017 Pension Benefits Table); (f) life insurance benefits generally available to all salaried employees; and
(g) distribution of account balances under the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans (the account balances of
the Named Executive Officers are reported in the 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table).
 
Rights and Payments Upon Retirement
 
Following retirement (as
described below), the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive:
 


 
●
continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the Company’s stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the original term (up to 10 years) of such options;

 
 
 

 
●
for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position before January 1, 2006, or after December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the year worked only with respect to the performance shares granted in the year of retirement) and based on actual performance; and 

 
 
 

 
●
for those Named Executive Officers initially appointed to a 3M executive position on or after January 1, 2006, and on or before December 31, 2017, payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the three-year performance period that occurred prior to the date of the Named Executive Officer’s retirement) and based on actual performance.

 
For this purpose, the term
“Retirement” means a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of service
(age 55 with at least five years of service for awards granted before January 1, 2016).
 
Rights and Payments Upon
Termination Due to Disability
 
In the event of the termination
of their employment due to disability, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive:
 


 
●
continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the Company’s stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the original term (up to 10 years) of such options; 

 
 
 

 
●
immediate vesting of all restricted stock units previously granted under the Company’s stock plans; and 

 
 
 

 
●
payment for all previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year performance period, based on actual performance.

 
Rights and Payments Upon
Termination Due to Death
 
In the event of the termination
of their employment due to death, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive:
 


 
●
immediate vesting of all unvested stock options and restricted stock units previously granted under the Company’s stock plans, and the opportunity for the Named Executive Officer’s estate or beneficiaries to exercise all vested stock options during the two-year period following the date of death (but not beyond the original expiration date of any such stock option);

 


2018
    Proxy Statement | 
67


 
Table of Contents



 
●
payment to the Named Executive Officer’s estate or beneficiaries, no later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Named Executive Officer died, for all previously granted performance shares (in the same amount as paid for the performance shares granted to other Named Executive Officers if the date of death occurs after the end of the three-year performance period for such shares, and at the lesser of the target value or such other amount as determined by the Committee in its discretion if the date of death occurs before the end of the three-year performance period for such shares); and 

 
 
 

 
●
payment to the Named Executive Officer’s beneficiaries of the proceeds from the life insurance policies provided for such Named Executive Officer pursuant to the Company’s Executive Life Insurance Plan.

 
Rights and Payments Upon
Termination for Any Other Reason
 
In the event of the termination
of their employment for any reason other than retirement, death, or disability (and other than in connection with a change in control,
as described further below):
 


 
●
the Named Executive Officers will have the opportunity to exercise vested stock options granted under the Company’s stock plans within the first 90 days following the termination date (but not beyond the original expiration date of any such stock option), at which time any remaining vested stock options are forfeited; and 

 
 
 

 
●
all unvested stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to the Named Executive Officers are forfeited immediately.

 
Rights and Payments Upon
a Qualifying Termination in Connection with a Change in Control
 
If the Company terminates
a Named Executive Officer’s employment for reasons other than Misconduct (or for awards granted prior to May 10, 2016,
reasons other than Cause) or if a Named Executive Officer resigns for Good Reason, in any such case within 18 months following
a “change in control event” of the Company (as defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code),
all of the Named Executive Officer’s outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock units granted under the Company’s
stock plans will be immediately vested and all of such Named Executive Officer’s outstanding performance shares will be prorated
and settled in accordance with the terms of the plan.
 
For purposes of our outstanding
long-term incentive awards, the terms “Misconduct”, “Cause”, and “Good Reason” mean the following:
 
“Misconduct” means (i) the Named Executive Officer’s willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties
(other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the Named Executive Officer’s willful failure to carry
out, or comply with any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the occurrence of
any act or omission by the Named Executive Officer that could reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) his or her
conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or indictable
offense or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) the Named Executive Officer’s commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement,
misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of
their officers, directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) the Named Executive Officer’s material
breach of any material provision of any written agreement with the Company or any subsidiary; or (vi) any other intentional misconduct
by the Named Executive Officer that significantly affects the business or affairs of the Company or any subsidiary in an adverse
manner.
 
“Cause” means
a material violation of any policy of the Company, or embezzlement or theft of property belonging to the Company.
 
“Good Reason”
means (i) a material diminution in the Named Executive Officer’s position, authority, duties, or responsibilities as in effect
immediately prior to the change in control; (ii) a material diminution in the Named Executive Officer’s base salary or annual
planned cash compensation; or (iii) a material change in the geographic location at which the Named Executive Officer is required
to perform services for the Company.
 
The amounts payable to or
on behalf of each of the Named Executive Officers in each of the above situations (other than amounts relating to payments or benefits
generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees) is reflected in the following table, assuming
that each individual’s employment had terminated and/or a change in control of the Company had occurred on December 31, 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Little, Mr. Roman, and Mr. Shin were eligible to retire (as that term is defined
for purposes of 3M’s stock plans).

FOOTNOTES TO 2017 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION
OR CHANGE IN CONTROL TABLE
 
(1) The amounts in this
column reflect the value of performance share awards under the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan
for which the three-year performance period has not been completed (adjusted to reflect the closing price of a share of 3M common
stock on the NYSE for December 29, 2017 ($235.37)), and which would be paid upon the occurrence of the respective triggering events
in accordance with the provisions of the plan.
 
(2) The amounts in this
column reflect the value of the shares underlying the unvested 3M restricted stock units that would vest upon the occurrence of
the respective triggering events in accordance with the terms of the awards. Share values are based on the closing price of a share
of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 29, 2017 ($235.37).
 
(3) The amounts in this
column reflect the spread value on December 31, 2017, of unvested, in-the-money 3M stock options that will vest upon the occurrence
of the respective triggering events in accordance with the existing contractual terms of the stock options. Spread values are based
on the closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for December 29, 2017 ($235.37).
 
(4) The amounts in this
column reflect the life insurance proceeds that would be payable to each individual’s beneficiary or beneficiaries pursuant
to the policies obtained for them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan. Under such plan, individuals first appointed to an executive
position on or before August 31, 2003, receive additional life insurance coverage that is provided through a whole life insurance
policy or a universal life insurance policy and individuals first appointed on or after September 1, 2003, receive additional group
term life insurance coverage.

Pay Ratio
 
Presented below is the ratio
of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO). The ratio
presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In identifying our median
employee, we calculated the target annual total cash compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2017. For these purposes,
annual total cash compensation included base salary or hourly wages, cash incentives, commissions and comparable cash elements
of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources records. All amounts were annualized
for permanent employees who did not work for the entire year, such as new hires, employees on paid or unpaid leave of absence and
employees called for active military duty. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation.
 
We selected the median employee
from among 90,823 full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal workers who were employed as of December 31, 2017. As permitted
by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we excluded 1,575 employees (including 966 non-U.S. employees) who joined the Company during
2017 as part of our acquisition of Scott Safety when making this determination. Except for the employees excluded on the basis
of the Scott Safety acquisition completed in 2017, we did not exclude any other employees (whether pursuant to the de minimis
exemption for foreign employees or any other permitted exclusion).
 
As determined in accordance
with Item 402 of Regulation S-K, the 2017 annual total compensation was $20,494,285 for our CEO and $63,338 for our median employee.
Among other things, these amounts include base salary, overtime, incentive payments, stock-based compensation (based on the grant
date fair value of awards granted during 2017), changes in pension values and retirement plan contributions. As calculated in this
manner, the ratio of our CEO’s total compensation to our median employee’s total compensation for fiscal year 2017
is 324 to 1.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
 
Proposal No. 4: Stockholder Proposal on Special
Shareholder Meetings
 
3M has received a stockholder proposal from James
McRitichie, 9295 Yorkship Court, Elk Grove, CA 95758, the owner of 84 shares of 3M common stock (the “Proponent”).
The Proponent has requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting statement (in italics) in its
proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented
by the Proponent or the Proponent’s qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponent’s statement,
your Board of Directors recommends that you vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
 
RESOLVED:
 
The shareholders of 3M Company (MMM) (‘Company’)
hereby request that the Board of Directors take the steps necessary to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document
to give holders with an aggregate of 15% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal
does not impact our board’s current power to call a special meeting.
 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT:
 
Delaware law allows 10% of company shares
to call a special meeting. A shareholder right to call a special meeting is a way to bring an important matter to the attention
of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. This is important because there could be 15-months between
annual meetings.
 
A shareholder right to act by written consent
and to call a special meeting are two complimentary ways to bring an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders
outside the annual meeting cycle. Both are associated with increased governance quality and shareholder value. Our Company offers
no right of shareholders to act by written consent.
 
Currently, 64% of S&P 500 companies have
adopted company bylaws, articles of incorporation, or charter provisions to allow shareholders to call a special meeting. Even
more than half of all S&P 1500 companies allow shareholders this right.
 
This topic won more than 44% support at our
Company in 2016. According to Proxy Insight, 266 funds voted for, while 79 voted against. Unfortunately, large funds like Vanguard,
State Street and BlackRock were among those voting against. We hope they and others will reconsider their position this year.
 
This proposal topic won majority votes last
year at Salesforce.com, NETGEAR, CVS Health and United Rentals. It may be possible to adopt this proposal by simply incorporating
this text into our governing documents:
 
“Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise
prescribed by statute, may be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President, and shall be called by the Chairman of the
Board or President or Secretary upon the order in writing of a majority of or by resolution of the Board of Directors, or at the
request in writing of stockholders owning 15% net long of the entire capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote.”
 
We urge the Board to join the mainstream of major U.S. companies and establish a right for shareholders
owning 15% of our outstanding common stock to call a special meeting.
 
Please vote for: Special Shareowner Meetings

Board’s Statement Opposing the Proposal
 
After careful consideration, and for the reasons
set forth below, the Board believes that the proposal to ask our Board to take the steps necessary to give holders with an aggregate
of 15 percent of our outstanding common stock the right to call a special stockholder meeting, subject to the conditions specified
in the proposal, is not in the best interests of 3M or its stockholders for the following reasons:

Our stockholders already have a meaningful right to call
    a special meeting. The Company’s Bylaws already permit the holders of 25 percent of 3M’s outstanding stock to
    call a special stockholder meeting upon written request to the Board. In light of our strong corporate governance practices
    and the many stockholder protections already in place, the Board believes that giving stockholders owning 25 percent of the
    Company’s outstanding stock the ability to call special stockholder meetings strikes the appropriate balance between
    giving stockholders the ability to call special meetings to vote on important matters that arise between Annual Meetings and
    protecting the resources of the Company and interests of all stockholders. The Board has an established protocol for stockholders
    to communicate with our independent Lead Director, the chairs of the Board committees, and other independent directors. In
    addition, management engages in regular, ongoing outreach to listen to and solicit input from our stockholders. Lowering the
    threshold to 15 percent could force the Company to expend a great deal of time and money on a special meeting, as described
    below, even if up to 85 percent of the Company’s stockholders do not want a special meeting.

 
 

2.
Given the size of the Company and the number of its stockholders,
    convening a meeting of stockholders is a significant undertaking that requires a substantial commitment of time and
    financial     resources. The Company must pay to prepare, print, and distribute legal disclosure documents to stockholders,
    solicit proxies,     and tabulate votes. The Board and management must also divert time from the business to prepare for and
    conduct the meeting.     Because of these burdens and costs to a company, special stockholder meetings should be
    extraordinary events that occur only     when a substantial percentage of the stockholders agree there are extremely pressing
    matters that must be addressed before     the next Annual Meeting. The current provision of the Bylaws allows for
    stockholders to call a special meeting when such an     extraordinary event arises, without enabling a small minority of
    stockholders to call meetings more frequently than necessary.     We believe that if less than 25 percent of the stockholders
    want a special meeting, this demonstrates that the need for a     special meeting is not so great as to warrant disrupting
    the conduct of 3M’s business and imposing unnecessary costs     on the Company and its stockholders. Therefore, we
    believe it is unnecessary and would be damaging to the Company and its     stockholders to lower the current threshold and
    give holders of only 15 percent of our outstanding stock the ability to call     an unlimited number of special meetings for
    any purpose at any time.

 
 

3.
Special meetings could also be misused by special interest stockholder
    groups. The proposal with its low 15 percent ownership requirement could subject the Company to disruption from special interest
    stockholder groups with an agenda not in the best interests of the Company or the majority of stockholders. Currently, special
    meetings of stockholders may be called by (i) a majority of the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Board, or (ii) the
    holders of 25 percent of 3M’s outstanding stock upon written request to the Board. Each director has a fiduciary duty
    to represent all stockholders when determining whether a matter is so pressing that it must be addressed at a special meeting.
    By way of contrast, stockholders do not have any fiduciary obligations to the Company or other stockholders. Stockholders
    can be self-interested in ways that directors, bound by the duties of care and loyalty, cannot be. The proposal would permit
    a small group of stockholders who have a special interest to use the extraordinary measure of a special meeting to serve their
    narrow self-interest. For example, would-be acquirers who seek to take over the Company for an inadequate price could use
    special meetings to avoid negotiating with the Board, which has the responsibility to protect the interests of all stockholders.
    In fact, if this proposal were implemented, a small group of stockholders would have the ability to call a special meeting
    at their sole discretion, at any time, with no duty to act other than in their own interests.

Proposal No. 5: Stockholder Proposal
on Setting Target Amounts for CEO Compensation
 
3M has received a stockholder proposal from
the United Steelworkers, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International
Union, 60 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, PA 15222, the owner of 68 shares of 3M common stock (the “Proponent”).
The Proponent has requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting statement (in italics) in its
proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented
by the Proponent or the Proponent’s qualified representative. For the reasons set forth following the Proponent’s
statement, your Board of Directors recommends that you vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
 
RESOLVED: Shareholders of 3M Corporation
(the “Company’’) request that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors take into consideration the
pay grades and/or salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation.
The Compensation Committee should describe in the Company’s proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings how it complies
with this requested policy. Compliance with this policy is excused if it will result in the violation of any existing contractual
obligation or the terms of any existing compensation plan.
 
SUPPORTING STATEMENT
 
Like at many companies, our Company’s
Compensation Committee uses peer group benchmarks of what other companies pay their CEOs to set its target CEO compensation. These
target pay amounts are then subject to performance adjustments. To ensure that our Company’s CEO compensation is reasonable
relative to our Company’s overall employee pay philosophy and structure, we believe that the Compensation Committee should
also consider the pay grades and/or salary ranges of Company employees when setting CEO compensation target amounts.
 
This proposal does not require the Compensation
Committee to use other employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation targets. Under this proposal, the Compensation
Committee will have discretion to determine how other employee pay should impact CEO compensation targets. The Compensation Committee
also will retain authority to use peer group benchmarks and/or any other metric to set CEO compensation target amounts.
 
Over time, using peer group benchmarks to
set CEO compensation can lead to pay inflation. Although many companies target CEO compensation at the median of their peer group,
certain companies have targeted their CEO’s pay above median. In addition, peer groups can be cherry-picked to include larger
or more successful companies where CEO compensation is higher. (Charles Elson and Craig Ferrere, “Executive Superstars,
Peer Groups and Overcompensation,” Journal of Corporation Law, Spring 2013).
 
High pay disparities between CEOs and other
senior executives may undermine collaboration and teamwork. According to Institutional Shareholder Services, an excessive pay
disparity between the CEO and the next highest-paid named executive officer is a problematic pay practice that may result in a
recommendation to its clients that they vote against advisory votes on executive compensation. (Institutional Shareholder Services,
United States Proxy Voting Manual, February 23, 2016, p. 147).
 
In our view, the pay of non-executive employees
should also be considered. High CEO compensation can impact the morale and productivity of employees who are not senior executives.
According to a Glassdoor study of employee opinions, “Higher CEO compensation is statistically linked to lower CEO approval
ratings on average” (Glassdoor, What Makes a Great CEO?, August 2016, available at https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/what-makes-a-great-ceo/).
 
For those reasons, we urge you to vote in
favor of this proposal.

Table of Contents

Board’s Statement Opposing the Proposal
 
After careful consideration, and for the reasons
set forth below, the Board believes that it is not in the best interests of 3M or its stockholders to approve the proposed resolution,
for the following reasons:
 


1.
The Company already maintains global compensation principles that
    are intended to ensure that its compensation practices are fair and reasonable as applied to both executive and non-executive
    employees. These principles align with the Company’s vision and strategies, balance both individual and enterprise-wide
    performance and seek to provide competitive wages and benefits with consistent positioning in the median range of the most-relevant
    markets to all employees based on roles, responsibilities, skills and performance. To monitor and ensure the effectiveness
    of this program, the Company also regularly compares its pay components to those of other premier companies, and adjusts them
    as necessary to stay competitive and attract, retain and motivate a highly qualified, diverse workforce at all levels throughout
    the organization, not just for its executives.

 
 

2.
The Board of Directors believes that the overwhelming majority of our stockholders
    support the Company’s current executive compensation program. As described in more detail in the Compensation Discussion
    and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, the current program emphasizes a strong pay-for-performance philosophy and seeks
    to align the compensation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers with the interests of
    long-term 3M stockholders. In 2017, approximately 96 percent of the votes cast on the Company’s say-on-pay proposal
    approved the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in last year’s Proxy Statement.

 
 

3.
The actions requested by the proposal are ambiguous and implementation would
    impose a significant time, cost and resource burden on the Company. As the Proponent acknowledges, the proposal “does
    not require the Compensation Committee to use other employee pay data in a specific way to set CEO compensation targets.”
    The proposal instead indicates only that the Compensation Committee should “take into consideration the pay grades and/or
    salary ranges of all classifications of Company employees when setting target amounts for CEO compensation.” Left unanswered
    are questions about how to put such information in context so that it is not misleading. For example, it is unclear whether
    or how adjustments should be made for part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, differences in currencies, differences
    in cost-of-living or variations in compensation structures for employees who receive sales incentives, overtime compensation
    or other significant benefits (e.g., health benefits, retirement benefits, housing allowances) in lieu of base salary. 3M
    has operations and different compensation programs in more than 70 countries around the world. Compliance with the proposal
    would require substantial coordination with local employees in foreign countries to collect and transmit the necessary data
    on “all classifications” of the Company’s more than 90,000 employees worldwide, all of which would need
    to be carefully analyzed and summarized. The Company believes that the time, cost and resource burden associated with implementing
    the proposal is not warranted by any benefit that the resulting information may be able to offer.

 


RECOMMENDATION
                                         OF THE BOARD

 


The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal. Proxies solicited
      by the Board of Directors will be voted “AGAINST” this proposal unless a stockholder indicates otherwise in
      voting the proxy.

allocation decisions. The fees paid are reviewed by the fiduciaries of the retirement plans and are determined to be reasonable
for the services provided.

the Company’s Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan, which are 401(k) retirement
savings plans. State Street Bank and Trust Company provides custody, investment management, and corporate finance services to
the Company and a number of employee benefit plans sponsored by the Company and its affiliates. The 3M Voluntary Investment Plan
and Employee Stock Ownership Plan, the 3M Savings Plan and 3M Retiree Welfare Benefit Plan utilize State Street Global Advisors,
an affiliate of State Street Bank and Trust Company, as an investment manager. State Street Bank and Trust Company also provides
custody services for the Company’s defined contribution plans in the U.S. Further, State Street Bank and Trust Company is
a participant of 3M Company’s $3.75 billion revolving credit agreement dated March 9, 2016. In total, the Company and the
various employee benefit plans paid fees of $2.1 million to State Street Bank and Trust Company and its affiliates in 2017. In
addition, the Trustee will charge the funds an annual administration fee and transaction fees which are incorporated into the

million in 2017 to BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates, a majority of which was paid by the participants in the 3M Voluntary Investment
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. In addition, the Trustee will charge the funds held by the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan
and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings Plan an annual administration fee which is incorporated into the funds’
NAV. The fees paid are reviewed by the fiduciaries of the employee benefit plans and are determined to be reasonable for the services

Information About the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials
 
Why did I receive a Notice
of Internet Availability of the proxy materials and not the printed proxy materials?
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission allows
companies to furnish their proxy materials to stockholders over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many of our stockholders
a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing
the notice and proxy materials by e-mail to some of our stockholders who previously consented to electronic delivery of proxy materials.
Those stockholders should have received an e-mail containing a link to the website where the proxy materials are available, as
well as a link to the proxy voting website. All stockholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will
have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials
by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the notice.
In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access
them electronically in connection with future distributions of proxy materials. Distributing proxy materials electronically conserves
natural resources and reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials.
 
Why did I receive a printed
copy of the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
 
We are providing some of our stockholders,
including stockholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy
materials instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
 
How do I view the proxy

Please note that you MAY NOT USE your Notice

        Availability of Proxy Materials in an attempt to vote your shares, that vote will not count.

Stockholders Entitled to Vote
 
Each share of our common stock outstanding
as of the close of business on March 13, 2018, the record date, is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly
brought before the meeting. As of that date, there were 594,707,931 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
 
Most 3M stockholders hold their shares through
a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee (which for simplicity we refer to as a “broker or other nominee”) rather
than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned
beneficially:
 


STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD
 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with 3M’s transfer agent,
    EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and the Notice of Internet Availability
    of Proxy Materials, or if you requested paper delivery, a copy of these proxy materials are being sent directly to you by
    3M. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the
    meeting. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
    and below under the heading “Voting Methods.”

BENEFICIAL OWNER
 
If your shares are held by a broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner
    of shares held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or other nominee who is
    considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or
    other nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record,
    you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting, unless you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or other nominee.
    Your broker or other nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for you to use. You may also vote
    on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the
    heading “Voting Methods.” If you fail to provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee, it will
    have discretion to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 2, but not with respect to Proposals 1, 3, 4, or 5, as described
    below under “Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and Approve Each of the Proposals Described in this Proxy Statement.”

PLAN ACCOUNTS
 
If your shares are held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of these shares and the trustee of the plans
    is considered the stockholder of record. Participants in 3M’s Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
    Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may direct the trustee on how to vote the shares allocated to their account via the Internet,
    by telephone, or by signing and submitting the proxy card as described in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
    and below under the heading “Voting Methods.” Participants in 3M’s Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may also direct the trustee how to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares
    of common stock for which it has not received direction by following the same voting instructions. If you fail to direct the
    trustee how to vote your shares by following these instructions, the trustee will vote your shares as described in the proxy
    card.

 
Proposals you are Asked to Vote on and
the Board’s Voting Recommendations
 
The following proposals are included in
this Proxy Statement and are scheduled to be voted on at the meeting. 3M’s Board recommends that you vote your shares as

Other than the proposals described in this
Proxy Statement, the Board is not aware of any other matters to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy
by telephone, Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the persons appointed by the Board as proxy holders
— Nicholas C. Gangestad, Gregg M. Larson, and Inge G. Thulin — will have the discretion to vote your shares on any
additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. If any of our nominees is unavailable as a candidate for director,
the above-named proxy holders will vote your proxy for another candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board of Directors.
 
Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and Approve Each of
the Proposals Described in This Proxy Statement
 


QUORUM
 
The presence of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. As discussed below, a “broker non-vote” occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.

BROKER VOTING
 

Under NYSE rules, brokers have discretionary
        authority to vote their clients’ shares in “routine” matters (including Proposal 2, the ratification of PwC as
        our independent registered public accounting firm) so long as the beneficial owner of those shares did not provide voting instructions
        to the broker at least ten days before the stockholder meeting. Director elections, stockholder proposals, and the say-on-pay proposal,
        are not considered “routine” matters for these purposes. As a result, if you do not provide your broker with instructions
        as to how to vote your shares, your broker will be prohibited from voting on Proposals 1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a “broker
        non-vote” with respect to those proposals.
 
If you are a beneficial owner (other than
        as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan), your broker or
        other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered
        public accounting firm for 2018, even if it does not receive voting instructions from you.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
 
In accordance with 3M’s Bylaws, each director is elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast (which means the number of votes cast “for” a director’s election exceeds the number of votes cast “against” that director’s election, with “abstentions” and “broker non-votes” not counted as a vote cast either “for” or “against” that director’s election) with respect to that director’s election at this meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. 

 
 
The Nominating and Governance Committee has established procedures under which any incumbent director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the election, the Nominating and Governance Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the Committee’s recommendation, and publicly disclose (by issuing a press release and filing appropriate disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision within ninety (90) days following certification of the election results. The Nominating and Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. 

 
 
An incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the election and who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the procedures described above shall remain active and engaged in Board activities while the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board decide whether to accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action should be taken. However, it is expected that such incumbent director shall not participate in any proceedings by the Nominating and Governance Committee or the Board regarding whether to accept or reject such director’s resignation, or whether to take other action with respect to such director. 

 
 
If the Board of Directors accepts a director’s resignation, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the Bylaws.

ALL OTHER PROPOSALS
 
The affirmative “FOR” vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve Proposals 2, 3, 4, and 5. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal “broker non-votes” (if applicable) are not counted as votes “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal. An abstention will, however, be counted as entitled to vote on a proposal and will, therefore, have the effect of a vote “AGAINST.”

 
Voting Methods
 
If you hold shares directly as the stockholder
of record, you may vote by granting a proxy or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting by requesting a ballot. If you hold shares
beneficially in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or other nominee or in person at the
Annual Meeting by requesting a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee. If you own shares beneficially as a participant in
the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by submitting voting instructions
to the trustee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Even if you plan to
attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted
if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.
 
Please refer to the summary instructions
below and those included on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card or, for shares held in street
name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker or other nominee.

Counting the Vote
 
In the election of directors, you may vote
“FOR” or “AGAINST” one or more of the nominees or you may “ABSTAIN.” Abstentions will have
no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For Proposals 2, 3, 4, and 5, you may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,”
or “ABSTAIN,” but please note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST.” If you sign
your proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with
the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan or the 3M Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in “Stockholders Entitled to Vote” beginning
on page 80.
 
Representatives of Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of election.
 
Confidentiality
 
The Company’s Board of Directors has
a policy that all stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders are to be maintained in confidence.
No such document will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder will not be disclosed, except
as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company.
Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M management.
 
Results of the Vote
 
We will issue a press release announcing
the preliminary voting results for items of business properly presented at the meeting and will disclose the results for those
items in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual
Meeting date. The press release with voting results will also be available on our website at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml.
 
Delivery of Documents to Stockholders
Sharing an Address
 
Securities and Exchange Commission rules
allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to any household not participating in electronic proxy
material delivery at which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family (a practice
called “householding”). We believe that householding benefits both you and the Company by eliminating duplicate mailings
to stockholders living at the same address and by reducing our printing and mailing costs. Each stockholder will continue to receive
a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.
 
Your household may have received a
single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future years, please request a
duplicate set by calling 1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com, by e-mailing sendmaterial@proxyvote.com,
or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively, if your household received
multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and members of your household who are entitled to receive proxy materials would
all prefer to receive only a single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a request as specified in the preceding
sentence.
 
If a broker or other nominee holds your
shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing
stockholders to consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does not request continuation of duplicate
mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings,
you may need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.
 
List of Stockholders
 
A list of the stockholders of record entitled
to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for inspection at the Annual Meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting. The
list also will be available for ten days prior to the meeting between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time,
at our offices at Aearo Technologies, 7911 Zionsville Road, Indianapolis, Indiana 46268, by contacting the Secretary of the Company.

Cost of Proxy Solicitation
 
3M will pay for the cost of preparing, assembling, printing,
mailing, and distributing these proxy materials. You will need to obtain your own Internet access if you choose to access the proxy
materials and/or vote over the Internet. In addition to mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may
be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive
any additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist
us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc.
a fee of $20,000 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and
fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners of
stock.
 
Transfer Agent
 
Our transfer agent is EQ Shareowner Services. All communications
concerning stockholders of record accounts, including address changes, name changes, common stock transfer requirements, and similar
issues can be handled by contacting EQ Shareowner Services at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064 (outside the U.S.), www.shareowneronline.com,

Requirements for Submission of Stockholder Proposals for Next
Year’s Annual Meeting
 
In order for a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion
in 3M’s Proxy Statement for next year’s Annual Meeting, our Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal by November
21, 2018. Such proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the stockholder to
determine when the proposal was received by the Company) to: Gregg M. Larson, Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Secretary,
3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-13E-26A, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000. Such proposals must comply with the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s regulations regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in Company sponsored proxy materials, such as the
stockholder continuing to own a minimum number of shares until the Annual Meeting and appearing in person or through an authorized
representative at the meeting to present the proposal.
 
Alternatively, stockholders intending
to present a proposal at next year’s Annual Meeting without having it included in the Company’s Proxy Statement
must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company’s Bylaws, a copy of which is available at www.3M.com
under Investor Relations — Governance. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive
written notice from the stockholder no earlier than the close of business on November 21, 2018, and no later than the close
of business on December 21, 2018. The notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws.
 
Proposals received by the Corporate Secretary after the dates
mentioned will not be included in the Proxy Statement or acted upon at next year’s Annual Meeting.
 
By Order of the Board of Directors.

APPENDIX
A - SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INFORMATION
 
Reconciliation
of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 (Millions, except per-share amounts)
(Unaudited)
 
In addition to reporting financial results in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discusses non-GAAP measures that exclude
special items. Operating income, net income attributable to 3M (hereafter referred to as “net income”), and diluted
earnings per share attributable to 3M common stockholders (hereafter referred to as “diluted earnings per share”) are
all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure (excluding special items). Special items are
not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Special items represent significant charges or credits that
are important to an understanding of the Company’s ongoing operations. The Company uses these
non-GAAP measures to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results excluding
special items is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing operating trends. The determination of special
items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
 
The reconciliations provided
below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the twelve months
ended December 31, there were no special items in 2016:

(a) During the
fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the
“U.S. Tax Reform Legislation”). The expense is primarily related to the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation’s transition
tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and
liabilities considering the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional
amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the U.S.
Tax Reform Legislation, as provided by recent SEC guidance. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP,
the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation.
This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and
the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures
are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. Because of the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation, the Company
made a $600 million pension contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan. This contribution did not impact 2017 net income,
but it did impact Free Cash Flow Conversion and ROIC. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing
the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors
as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends.
 
(b) Free cash flow and free
cash flow conversion are not defined under GAAP. Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow
data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company
defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should
not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash
flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow
conversion is meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication
of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate cash. In 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted
by 3M’s enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Legislation, along with a U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made
following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by three percentage points.
Refer to the proceeding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted
operating cash flow. Refer to the proceeding “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital
spending for property, plant and equipment.
 
(c) Return on Invested Capital
(ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute
for other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense)
divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder
value creation.
