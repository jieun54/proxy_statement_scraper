By Order of the Board of Directors,




 







 


GREGG M. LARSON




 


Associate General Counsel and Secretary




 
THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND PROXY CARD ARE BEING
DISTRIBUTED ON OR ABOUT MARCH 26, 2007.
iii




PROXY STATEMENT
The Board of Directors (the Board) of 3M Company, a
Delaware corporation (3M or the Company) is soliciting proxies for the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders. You are receiving a proxy statement because you
own shares of 3M common stock that entitle you to vote at the meeting. By use
of a proxy, you can vote whether or not you attend the meeting. The proxy
statement describes the matters we would like you to vote on and provides
information on those matters so you can make an informed decision.
The information included in
this proxy statement relates to proposals to be voted on at the meeting (if
properly presented), the voting process, 3Ms Board and Board committees, the
compensation of directors and certain executive officers, and other required
information.
Purpose of the Annual
Meeting
The purpose of the Annual
Meeting is to elect directors and to conduct the business described in the
Notice of Annual Meeting.
Annual Meeting
Admission
Only stockholders are invited to attend the meeting.
An admission ticket or proof of ownership of 3M stock, along with personal
identification, must be presented in order to be admitted to the Annual
Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, your admission ticket is on the
back of this proxy statement. If your shares are held in the name of a bank,
broker or other holder of record, you must bring a brokerage statement or other
proof of ownership with you to the Annual Meeting, or obtain an admission
ticket in advance. Tickets are also available on the Internet voting site 
www.eproxy.com/mmm. If you do not provide
photo identification or comply with the other procedures outlined above, you
will not be admitted to the Annual Meeting.
No cameras (including cell phone cameras), recording equipment,
electronic devices, large bags, briefcases, or packages will be permitted in
the Annual Meeting.
Stockholders Entitled
to Vote
Each share of our
common stock outstanding as of the close of business on March 9, 2007, the
record date, is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter
properly brought before the meeting. As of that date, there were 727,566,923
shares of common stock issued and outstanding.
Most 3M stockholders
hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, trustee, or other nominee rather
than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some
distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:
·       STOCKHOLDER
OF RECORD  If your shares are registered directly in your name with 3Ms
Transfer Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of
record of those shares and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you
by 3M. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting
proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting.
·       BENEFICIAL OWNER  If
your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, by a bank, trustee, or other
nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name
and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, trustee,
or nominee who is considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee, or nominee
on how to vote and are also invited to attend the meeting. However, since you
are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote 
1 


these shares in person at the meeting. Your broker,
trustee, or nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card
for you to use.
·       If your shares are held in
your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of these
shares and the trustee of the plans is the stockholder of record. Participants
in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M
Savings Plan may direct the trustee how to vote the shares allocated to their
account by following the voting instructions contained on the proxy card.
Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan may also direct the trustee how to vote a proportionate number of
allocated shares of common stock for which it has not received direction, and
shares not allocated to individual participant accounts by following the same voting
instructions. If you fail to direct the trustee how to vote your shares by
following these voting instructions, the trustee will vote your shares as
described in the voting instructions.
Proposals You Are Asked
to Vote On and the Boards Voting Recommendations
The
following proposals are scheduled to be voted on at the meeting. 3Ms Board
recommends that you vote your shares as indicated below.



Proposals:


 


 


The Boards
  Voting Recommendations:




1.  The election of directors.


 


 


FOR
  each nominee
  to the Board




2.  The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
  as 3Ms independent registered public accounting firm.


 


 


FOR




3.  Proposal to amend the Companys Certificate of Incorporation to
  eliminate the supermajority vote requirements.


 


 


FOR




4.  Proposal to amend the Companys Certificate of Incorporation to
  eliminate the fair price provision.


 


 


FOR




5.  Proposal to approve the Executive Annual Incentive Plan.


 


 


FOR




6.  Proposal to approve the material terms of the performance
  criteria under the Performance Unit Plan.


 


 


FOR




7.  Stockholder proposal on executive compensation based on the performance
  of peer companies.


 


 


AGAINST



 
Other than the proposals
described in this proxy statement, the Board is not aware of any other matters
to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy by
telephone, Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the
persons named as proxy holders  George W. Buckley, 3Ms Chairman,
President and CEO, Vance D. Coffman, and Rozanne L. Ridgway  will have
the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented
for a vote at the meeting. If any of our nominees is unavailable as a candidate
for director, the above-named proxy holders will vote your proxy for another
candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board of Directors.
2 


Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and Approve
Each of the Proposals Described in this Proxy Statement
Quorum 
The presence of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented
by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker
non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of
determining a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker, or other
holder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a
particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting
power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the
beneficial owner.
If you are a beneficial
owner (other than as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and
Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan), your bank, broker, or
other holder of record is permitted to vote your shares on the election of directors,
the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered
public accounting firm, and the Proposals to amend the Companys Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the supermajority and fair price
provisions, even if the record holder does not receive voting instructions from
you. The record holder may not vote on the stockholder proposal absent
instructions from you. Without your voting instructions, a broker non-vote will
occur.
Election
of Directors  The nominees for election as
directors at the Annual Meeting will be elected by a plurality of the votes
cast at the meeting. This means that the director nominee with the most votes
for a particular slot is elected for that slot. Votes withheld from one or more
director nominees will have no effect on the election of any director from whom
votes are withheld.
Majority
Vote Policy  Our Corporate Governance
Guidelines, which appear in Appendix B in this proxy statement, set forth our
procedures if a director-nominee is elected, but receives a majority of withheld
votes. In an uncontested election (i.e., an election where the only nominees
are those recommended by the Board), any nominee for director who receives a
greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for
such election is required to tender his or her resignation. The Nominating and
Governance Committee is required to make recommendations to the Board with
respect to any such letter of resignation. The Board is required to take action
with respect to this recommendation and to disclose their decision-making
process. Full details of this Policy are set out under Proposal No. 1 
Election of Directors and in paragraph B6 of the Corporate Governance
Guidelines in Appendix B.
The
Proposals to Amend the Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
The affirmative FOR vote by the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of
the outstanding common stock entitled to vote is required to approve the
amendments to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation. An
abstention on this proposal is not an affirmative vote and will have the same
effect as a vote against this proposal.
All Other Proposals  The
affirmative FOR vote of a majority of those shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is
required to approve all other proposals. In tabulating the voting result for
any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not
considered entitled to vote on that proposal. The stockholder proposal is
presented as a request to the Board to take action. Affirmative votes for this
proposal will inform the Board about the level of support for this proposal.
Voting Methods
If you hold shares directly as the stockholder of
record, you may vote by granting a proxy or, if you hold shares beneficially in
street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. If
you own shares beneficially as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment
Plan and 
3 


Employee Stock Ownership Plan
or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to the
trustee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by
telephone, or by mail. Please refer to the summary instructions below and those
included on your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting
instruction card included by your broker or nominee.
The Internet and
telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by use of
a control number and to allow you to confirm that your instructions have been
properly recorded. If you vote by telephone or on the Internet, you do not need
to return your proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting for stockholders of
record will be available 24 hours a day, and will close at 12:00 p.m.
(Central Time) on the day before the Annual Meeting. Participants in 3Ms
Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings
Plan may instruct the trustee how to vote their shares via the Internet, by
telephone, or by signing and returning the proxy card by 5:00 p.m. (Central
Time) on May 4, 2007.
·       VOTE BY INTERNET  www.eproxy.com/mmm 
If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy from any location in the
world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card and the last four
digits of your Social Security Number in hand when you access the Web site.
When prompted, enter the last four digits of your Social Security Number, your
3-digit company number, and the 7-digit number from the upper right
corner of the proxy card to create an electronic ballot.
·       VOTE
BY TELEPHONE  1-800-560-1965  If you live in the
United States, you may use any touch-tone telephone to vote your proxy
toll-free 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card in hand when you
call. When prompted, enter the 3-digit company number and the 7-digit
number from the upper right corner of the proxy card. Follow the recorded
instructions.
·       VOTE
BY MAIL  You may do this by signing your proxy card or, for shares held
in street name, the voting instruction card included by your broker or nominee
and mailing it. If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will
be voted as you instruct. If you sign, but do not provide instructions, your
shares will be voted as the Board recommends. Mark, sign, and date your proxy
card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided so that it is received
by May 7, 2007.
All shares that have been
properly voted and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Changing Your Vote
You may change your proxy
instructions at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. For shares
held directly in your name, you may accomplish this by granting a new proxy or
by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. For shares held beneficially by you,
you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker
or nominee.
Counting the Vote
In the election of directors, you may vote FOR all
of the nominees or your vote may be WITHHELD from one or more of the
nominees. For the other proposals, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.
If you ABSTAIN, it has the same effect as a vote AGAINST.  If you sign your proxy card or broker voting
instruction card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in
accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account
in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M
Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in Stockholders
Entitled to Vote on page 1.
4 


Representatives of Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 3Ms transfer agent, will tabulate the votes and act as the
inspectors of election.
Confidentiality
The Companys Board of
Directors has a policy that all stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations
that identify stockholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document
will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder
will not be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow
the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes must be
independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, stockholders
provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M
management.
Results of the Vote
We will announce preliminary
voting results at the meeting and publish final results in our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2007. A news
release with voting results will be available on our Web site www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml.
Delivery of Proxy
Materials
Securities and Exchange Commission rules now
allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to
any household at which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the
stockholders are members of the same family. This rule benefits both you
and the Company. We believe it eliminates irritating duplicate mailings that
stockholders living at the same address receive and it reduces our printing and
mailing costs. This rule applies to any annual reports, proxy statements,
proxy statements combined with a prospectus, or information statements. Each
stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting
instruction card.
Your household may have received a single set of proxy
materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future
years, please request a duplicate set by contacting our transfer agent, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064
(outside the U.S.), www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices, or in writing
to 161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075.
If a broker or other nominee
holds your shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain
brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing stockholders to
consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does
not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and
nominees may offer stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate
duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or nominee directly to
discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.
List of Stockholders
The names of stockholders of
record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual
Meeting and for ten days prior to the meeting for any purpose germane to the
meeting, between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. (Central Time),
at our principal executive offices at 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota, by
contacting the Secretary of the Company.
Electronic Delivery of
Proxy Materials and Annual Report
We are able to distribute the
annual report and proxy statement to 3M stockholders in a fast and efficient
manner via the Internet. This reduces the amount of paper delivered to a
stockholders address and eliminates the cost of sending these documents by
mail. Stockholders may elect to view 
5 


all future
annual reports and proxy statements on the Internet instead of receiving them
by mail. If you choose to view these materials online, you will continue to
receive a proxy card in the mail. You may make this election when voting your
proxy this year: simply follow the instructions to vote via the Internet or go
directly to www.econsent.com/mmm to register your consent. Have your
account number (found above your name and address on your dividend check stub)
and your Social Security Number (if you have one) available. Your election to
view proxy materials online continues until you revoke it. Future proxy cards
will contain the Internet Web site address and instructions to view the materials.
You will continue to have the option to vote your shares by telephone, mail, or
via the Internet.
Cost of Proxy
Solicitation
3M  will pay for the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing,
and distributing these proxy materials. You will need to obtain your own
Internet access if you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over
the Internet. In addition to mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of
proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or electronic
communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who do not receive any
additional compensation for these solicitation activities. We have hired
Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist us in the
distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay
Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a fee of $20,000 plus expenses
for these services. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other
custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to beneficial owners
of stock.
Transfer Agent
Our Transfer Agent is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All
communications concerning stockholders of record accounts, including address
changes, name changes, common stock transfer requirements, and similar issues
can be handled by contacting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952
(U.S.), 651-450-4064 (outside the U.S.), www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices,
or in writing, 161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075.

Corporate Governance
Guidelines
The Board has adopted
Corporate Governance Guidelines that, along with the charters of the Board
committees, provide the framework for the governance of the Company. The Boards
Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing
the Guidelines at least annually, and recommending any proposed changes to the
Board for approval. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our
Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations  Corporate
Governance. The Guidelines and charters of the Board committees are also
attached to this proxy statement as Appendices B-F.
Executive Sessions
Independent directors regularly meet in executive
sessions without the Chairman and CEO or other members of management present to
review the criteria upon which the performance of the Chairman and CEO is
based, the performance of the Chairman and CEO against that criteria, to ratify
the compensation of the Chairman and CEO as approved by the Compensation
Committee, and to discuss any other relevant matters.
Lead Independent
Director
The 3M Board of
Directors has appointed an independent director to serve in a lead capacity (Lead
Director) to coordinate the activities of the other non-management directors,
and to perform such other duties and responsibilities as the Board of Directors
may determine. Currently the Lead Director is Vance D. Coffman. The Lead
Director:
·       presides at all meetings of
the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of
the independent directors;
·       acts as a key liaison
between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;
·       assists the Chairman/CEO in
setting the Board agenda and frequency of meetings;
·       has
the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; and
·       communicates Board member
feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the Compensation
Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEOs performance and
communicates the Boards evaluation of that performance to the Chairman/CEO).
Communication with
Directors
The Board of Directors has
adopted the following process for stockholders and other interested parties to
send communications to members of the Board. Stockholders and other interested
parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board,
or with any of our other independent directors, by sending a letter to the
following address: 3M Company, c/o Corporate Secretary, 3M Center, Building 220-13-W-39,
St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.
Director Independence
Pursuant to New York
Stock Exchange listing standards, the Board of Directors has adopted a formal
set of categorical Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the
determination of director independence, the full text of which is attached as
Appendix A to this proxy statement. In accordance with these Guidelines, a
director or nominee for director must be determined to have no material
relationship with the Company other than as a director. The Guidelines specify
the criteria by 
7 


which the independence of our
directors will be determined, including strict guidelines for directors and
their immediate families with respect to past employment or affiliation with
the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm. The
Guidelines also prohibit Audit Committee members from having any direct or
indirect financial relationship with the Company, and restrict both commercial
and not-for-profit relationships of all directors with the Company. Directors
may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit by the Company, and all
directors are required to deal at arms length with the Company and its
subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be perceived as a
conflict of interest.
In accordance with these Guidelines, the Board
undertook its annual review of director independence. During this review, the
Board considered transactions and relationships between each director
(including nominees for director), or any member of his or her immediate family
and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most recent
three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there were any
transactions or relationships between directors or any member of their
immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family
member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder).
The Board considered that in the ordinary course of business, transactions may
occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and companies at which some of
our directors are or have been officers. In particular, with respect to each of
the most recent three completed fiscal years, the Board evaluated for each of
the directors (and the nominee for director), Coffman, Eskew, Farrell, Henkel
(nominee for director), Liddy, and Sharer, the annual amount of sales to 3M by
the company where he serves (or served) as an executive officer, and purchases
by that company from 3M, and determined that the amount of sales and purchases
in each fiscal year was below one percent of the annual revenues of each of
those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence
Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable contributions to not-for-profit
organizations of which our directors or immediate family members are affiliated,
none of which approached the levels set forth in our Director Independence
Guidelines.
As a result of this review,
the Board affirmatively determined that the following directors (and the
nominee for director), are independent under these Guidelines:  Linda G. Alvarado, Vance D. Coffman, Michael
L. Eskew, W. James Farrell, Herbert L. Henkel (nominee for director), Edward
M. Liddy, Robert S. Morrison, Aulana L. Peters, Rozanne L. Ridgway, and
Kevin W. Sharer. The Board has also determined that no members of the
Audit Committee received any compensation from the Company other than directors
fees. George W. Buckley is considered an inside director because of his
employment as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company.
Director Nomination
Process
Role of the Nominating
and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance
Committee (Committee) identifies individuals that the Committee believes are
qualified to become Board members in accordance with the Board Membership
Criteria set forth below, and recommends selected individuals to the Board for
nomination to stand for election at the next meeting of stockholders of the
Company in which directors will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on
the Board between meetings of stockholders, the Committee identifies
individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members
in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria set forth below, and
recommends one or more of such individuals for appointment to the Board.
Nominees Proposed by
Stockholders for Consideration by the Committee
The Committee has a
policy to consider properly submitted stockholder nominees for candidates for
membership on the Board of Directors. Stockholders proposing individuals for
consideration by 
8 


the
Committee must include at least the following information about the proposed
nominee:  the proposed nominees name,
age, business or residence address, principal occupation or employment, and
whether such person has given written consent to being named in the proxy
statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. Stockholders
should send the required information about the nominee to:
Corporate Secretary
3M Company
3M Center
Building 220-13-W-39
St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.
In order for an individual
proposed by a stockholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation
as a Board nominee, the Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal no later
than 5 p.m. Central Time on November 27, 2007. Such proposals must be
sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the
stockholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The
Corporate Secretary will send properly submitted stockholder proposed
nominations to the Committee Chair for consideration at a future Committee
meeting. Individuals proposed by stockholders in accordance with these
procedures will receive the same consideration that individuals identified to
the Committee through other means receive.
Stockholder Nominations
In addition, 3Ms Bylaws
permit stockholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of stockholders
or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with
the notice of meeting. Stockholders intending to nominate a person for election
as a director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Companys
Bylaws. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary
receive written notice from the record stockholder no earlier than January 9,
2008, and no later than February 8, 2008. The notice must contain the
information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request
to the Corporate Secretary. Nominations received after February 8, 2008,
will not be acted upon at the Annual Meeting.
Director Qualifications
The
Committee periodically reviews with the Board the requisite skills and
characteristics of its members. 3Ms Corporate Governance Guidelines contain
Board Membership Criteria that apply to nominees for a position on 3Ms Board.
The Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills and
characteristics required of Board members given the current Board composition.
It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a high
performance organization creating competitive advantage for the Company. To
perform as such, the Board will be comprised of individuals who have
distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena of activity and
who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committees and the Boards
assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of:
(i)               Roles
and contributions valuable to the business community;
(ii)            Personal
qualities of leadership, character, judgment, and whether the candidate
possesses and maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the
community at large of integrity, trust, respect, competence, and adherence to
the highest ethical standards;
(iii)         Relevant
knowledge and diversity of background and experience in such things as
business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing,
international business, government, and the like; or
9 


(iv)         Whether
the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation,
participation, and attendance at all meetings.
In addition to these minimum
requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominees skills are
complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for
particular expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing, technology,
financial, marketing, international, governmental, or other areas of expertise,
and assess the nominees impact on Board dynamics and effectiveness.
Identification, Evaluation, and Selection of Nominees
The Committee periodically
reviews the appropriate size and composition of the Board and anticipates
future vacancies and needs of the Board. In the event the Committee recommends
an increase in the size of the Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee
considers qualified nominees from several sources, including current Board
members and nominees recommended by stockholders and other persons.
The Committee may from time to
time retain a director search firm to help the Committee identify qualified
director nominees for consideration by the Committee.
The Committee evaluates qualified director nominees at
regular or special Committee meetings against the current Board Membership
Criteria described above and reviews qualified director nominees with the
Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board interview candidates that
meet the Board Membership Criteria and the Committee selects nominees that best
suit the Boards current needs and recommends one or more of such individuals
for election to the Board. Of the ten nominees for election as directors at the
2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, nine are current directors and one is a
new nominee who was identified by the Chief Executive Officer and recommended
to the Board by the Nominating and Governance Committee.
3M Business Conduct Policies
More than a century of
operating with honesty and integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers,
credibility with our communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our
employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and
Principal Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3Ms business conduct
policies to ensure that our business is conducted in a consistently legal and
ethical manner. These policies form the foundation of a comprehensive process
that includes compliance with corporate policies and procedures and a
companywide focus on uncompromising honesty and integrity in every aspect of
our operations. Our business conduct policies cover many topics, including
antitrust and competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting,
protection of confidential information, and compliance with all laws and
regulations applicable to the conduct of our business.
Employees are required to
report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent
violation of the business conduct policies. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures
to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting,
internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the
confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters.
The Board of Directors adopted
a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors of the Company. This Code
incorporates long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board
follow to ensure the Companys business and the activities of the Board are
conducted with integrity, adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in
compliance with the law.
The Companys Business Conduct
Policies for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for
Directors are available on our Web site at www.3M.com under Investor
Relations  Corporate Governance and copies of these policies are also
available to any stockholder upon request to Investor Relations.
10 


Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures
The Board of Directors has adopted a written policy
requiring that the Nominating and Governance Committee shall review and approve
or ratify any transaction between the Company and any related person that is
required to be disclosed. For purposes of this practice the terms transaction
and related person have the meaning contained in Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a transaction, the
Committee shall consider:
1.               the nature of the
related persons interest in the transaction;
2.               the material terms
of the transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less
favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under
the same or similar circumstances;
3.               the significance of
the transaction to the related person;
4.               the significance of
the transaction to the Company;
5.               whether the
transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act
in the best interest of the Company; and
6.               any other matters
the Committee deems appropriate.
Any Committee member who is a related person with
respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations
or vote respecting such approval or ratification, provided, however, that such
director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of
the Committee which considers the transaction.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE
MEMBERSHIP
The Board currently has
ten directors and the following four Committees: Audit, Compensation, Finance,
and Nominating and Governance. In May 2006, the Board dissolved the Public
Issues Committee, reassigned most of its duties to the Compensation and
Nominating and Governance Committees, and formed a Finance Committee. The
membership during 2006 and the function of each Committee are described below.
During 2006, the Board of Directors held five
regularly scheduled meetings and three special meetings. Seven and two of our
incumbent directors attended 100 and 95 percent, respectively, of the regularly
scheduled and special meetings of the Board and Board Committees on which they
served in 2006. Kevin W. Sharer, who is not standing for re-election, attended
71 percent of the regularly scheduled and special meetings of the Board and
Board Committees on which he served in 2006. Mr. Sharer, who is Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Amgen Inc., did not attend several
meetings to avoid even the appearance of a potential conflict of interest
relating to the Companys sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business.
The Company has a long-standing policy that directors
are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless extenuating
circumstances prevent them from attending. All directors attended last years
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, except one director who was unable to attend
due to illness.
The Board
and each Committee conducted an evaluation of their performance in 2006.

Accounting Firm), and the performance of the Companys internal auditing
department. In addition, the Committee:
·                    Reviews the
annual audited and quarterly consolidated financial statements;
·                    Reviews the
Companys financial reporting process and disclosure and internal controls and
procedures, including major issues regarding accounting principles and
financial statement presentation, and critical accounting policies to be used

·                    Appoints, oversees, and approves

business conduct policies.
The Board of Directors has
determined that all of the Audit Committee members are independent, financially
literate, and have accounting or related financial management expertise
under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Board has also
determined that all of the Audit Committee members  Edward M. Liddy
(chair), Linda G. Alvarado, Michael L. Eskew, and W. James Farrell  are
audit committee financial experts as that term is defined by applicable SEC
regulations. The charter of the Audit Committee is available at www.3M.com
under Investor Relations  Corporate Governance  Committee
Composition and attached as Appendix C to this proxy statement.
Compensation Committee
In 2006, the Compensation Committee met seven times.
The Committee reviews the Companys compensation practices and policies,
annually reviews and approves (subject to ratification by the independent
directors of the Board) the compensation for the CEO, annually reviews and

performance, reviews and discusses with management of the Company the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis prepared in accordance with the SECs
disclosure rules for executive compensation, and furnishes a report for
inclusion in the Companys proxy statement. In addition, the Committee:

postretirement benefit plans that have a material financial impact upon the
Company; and

workforce diversity and equal employment opportunities.
The Board of Directors has
determined that all Compensation Committee members are independent under the
New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Board has also determined that
each Compensation Committee member qualifies as a Non-Employee Director under
Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that each
member (except Robert S. Morrison due to his service as interim CEO), qualifies
as an outside director under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code. The charter of the Compensation Committee is available at www.3M.com
under Investor Relations  Corporate Governance  Committee
Composition and attached as Appendix D to this proxy statement.

Annual Board/Committee Chair Fees. Nonemployee directors received an annual cash
retainer of $75,000 per year. In addition, the chair of a Board committee received
an additional annual fee of $15,000. In lieu of the cash fees, a director may
elect to receive common stock of the Company at current fair market value.
Stock Awards. Each nonemployee director is entitled to receive
$95,000 payable in May of each year in common stock of the Company
pursuant to the terms of the Companys 1992 Directors Stock Ownership Program.
Deferred Compensation. Each nonemployee director may defer all or part of
their annual cash fees or stock award until they cease to be members of the Board.
For directors who have made an election to defer their fees payable in cash,
the Company will credit their account with compensation due on the 45th day of
each calendar quarter. Interest at the prime rate (as charged by Wells Fargo
Bank on the first day of each calendar quarter) will be credited to each
account from the date of deposit, at the end of each calendar quarter and
immediately preceding any distribution. For directors who have made an election
to defer their annual stock award or annual cash fees into a common stock
equivalents account, the Company shall credit their account with 3M common
stock equivalents (including fractional share equivalents) which could have
been purchased on the first day of the calendar quarter using the closing price
of 3M common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day
immediately preceding such date. 3M common stock equivalents equal to dividends
paid on 3M common stock shall be credited to such an account on each dividend
payment date. The share equivalents shall be determined by using the closing
price of 3M common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the sixth business
day preceding the dividend record date. Appropriate adjustments shall be made
to the accounts for stock splits, stock dividends, merger, consolidation,
payment of dividends in other than cash, and similar circumstances affecting 3M
common stock.
Expenses. Nonemployee directors are reimbursed for their
expenses in connection with attending Board meetings (including expenses
related to spouses when they are invited to attend 
16 


Board
events). Nonemployee directors may use the Company aircraft for travel to and
from 3M Board meetings.
Stock Ownership
Guidelines. The Board has
adopted stock ownership guidelines that provide that each director should
attain over three successive terms an investment position in 3Ms stock
(including deferred common stock equivalents) equal to two times the annual
retainer. All directors currently meet these stock ownership guidelines except
for W. James Farrell who has been a director for less than one year.
Information regarding accumulated stock and deferred stock units is set forth
in the section entitled Common Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive
Officers.  Currently, 85 percent of
director compensation is paid in 3M stock or 3M common stock equivalents.
Matching Gift Program. The nonemployee directors are eligible to
participate in the matching gift program on the same terms as 3M employees.
Under this program, the 3M Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year
in contributions by the director to eligible institutions of higher education
or public broadcasting organizations.
Process for Setting Director Compensation. The Nominating and Governance Committee
periodically receives reports on the status of Board compensation in relation
to other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending to the Board
changes in compensation for nonemployee directors. Periodically, the Company,
through its human resources department, requests Frederic W. Cook &
Co., Inc. to conduct a survey of director compensation at other large U.S.
companies. Neither the Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has
any contractual arrangement with any other compensation consultant who has a
role in determining or recommending the amount or form of director
compensation.

PROPOSALS
TO BE VOTED ON
PROPOSAL
NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors currently has ten members. Except
for Kevin W. Sharer, each of the Board members is standing for re-election to
hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A new nominee,
Herbert L. Henkel, is also standing for election.
A plurality of votes cast is
required for the election of directors. However, under the Companys Corporate
Governance Guidelines, any nominee for
director in an uncontested election (i.e., an election where the only nominees
are those recommended by the Board) who receives a greater number of votes withheld
from his or her election than votes for such election (a Majority Withheld
Vote) will promptly tender his or her resignation for consideration by the
Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Nominating and Governance
Committee will promptly consider the best interests of 3M and its stockholders
and recommend to a committee of independent directors of the Board whether to
accept the tendered resignation or to take some other action, such as rejecting
the resignation and addressing the apparent underlying causes of the withheld
votes.
The Board will create a
committee of all the independent directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld
Vote to consider the Nominating and Governance Committees recommendation and
take action within 90 days following the uncontested election. Thereafter, the
committee of independent directors will promptly disclose its decision and an
explanation of how the decision was reached in a Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If one or more members of the
Nominating and Governance Committee receive a Majority Withheld Vote, then the
Board will create a committee of independent directors who did not receive a
Majority Withheld Vote to consider the resignation offers of all directors
receiving a Majority Withheld Vote and determine whether to accept the tendered
resignation(s) or to take some other action and promptly disclose their
decision as described above.
Except as provided in the next
sentence, a director receiving a Majority Withheld Vote shall remain active and
engaged in Board activities during this Nominating and Governance Committee and
Board process. Any director who receives a Majority Withheld Vote and tenders
his or her resignation pursuant to this provision will not participate in the
committee action regarding whether to accept the tendered resignation offer or
take some other action. However, if the only directors who did not receive a
Majority Withheld Vote in the same election constitute three or fewer
independent directors, then all independent directors may participate in the
committee action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer(s) or
to take some other action.
Each nominee elected as a director will continue in
office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, or until his
or her earlier death, resignation, or retirement.
We expect each nominee for
election as a director to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is not
able to serve, proxies will be voted in favor of the remainder of those
nominated and may be voted for substitute nominees, unless the Board chooses to
reduce the number of directors serving on the Board.
The principal occupation and
certain other information about the nominees is set forth on the following
pages.
The Proxy Committee appointed
by the Board of Directors intends to vote the proxy (if you are a stockholder of
record) for the election of each of these nominees, unless you indicate on the
proxy card that your vote should be withheld from any or all of the nominees.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR
the election of these nominees as directors.

PROPOSAL
NO. 3
PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE
COMPANYS RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO
ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS
Stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment
to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the
supermajority vote requirements and fair price provision by deleting Article ELEVENTH
(Amendment No.1).
In determining whether Amendment No. 1 is in the
best interests of the Companys stockholders, the Nominating and Governance
Committee and the Board considered arguments for and against the supermajority
vote requirement that was adopted by the Board and approved by the stockholders
in 1986. The Board considered that the provisions that require a supermajority
vote to amend certain provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
can be viewed as facilitating corporate governance stability by requiring broad
stockholder consensus to effect changes.
The Board also considered the views of investors who
believe that these provisions are inconsistent with principles of good corporate
governance in that they limit stockholders ability to participate effectively
in corporate governance. According to some investors, the requirement of a
supermajority vote can limit the ability of a majority of the stockholders at
any particular time to effect change by essentially providing a veto to a large
minority stockholder or group of stockholders. In addition, a lower threshold
for stockholder votes can increase stockholders ability to participate
effectively in corporate governance.
After weighing all of these considerations, the
Nominating and Governance Committee recommended the elimination of the
supermajority vote requirements, and the Board agreed and determined that Amendment
No. 1 is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders. The Board of Directors has adopted resolutions approving and
declaring the advisability of Amendment No. 1 and recommends that the
stockholders approve Amendment No. 1 by voting in favor of this Proposal.
The current supermajority vote provision and the proposed amendment are
described in greater detail below.
21 


Supermajority Vote Requirements
Article ELEVENTH of our Restated Certificate of
Incorporation requires the affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of our
outstanding voting stock to amend, alter, or repeal our Bylaws or certain
provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The proposed Amendment
No. 1 would remove the 80 percent supermajority vote requirement
currently in place to approve, alter, amend, or repeal the provisions of the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to:
·       To
amend, alter, or repeal any provision of our Bylaws; and
·       To amend, alter, or repeal Article ELEVENTH
or Article THIRTEENTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation. (The
Company has separately asked stockholders to repeal Article THIRTEENTH in
Proposal No. 4.)
If stockholders approve
Amendment No. 1, the principal effect will be that those provisions may be
amended, altered, or repealed upon approval of the Board of Directors and the
vote of the holders of a majority of 3Ms outstanding stock entitled to vote on
such amendment.
The Board has separately proposed to repeal other
provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as discussed in Proposal No. 4: Proposal to Amend the Companys Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to Eliminate the Fair Price Provision.
The amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation proposed under
Proposal No. 3 and Proposal No. 4 are set forth in Appendix G-1,
with deletions indicated by strikeout and additions indicated by underline that
will be made to the extent stockholders approve the amendments. The current
provisions and proposed amendment described above are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the actual text as set forth in Appendix G-1.
Vote Required:   The
affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of all outstanding shares of
Common Stock is required for approval of this proposal. An abstention on this
proposal is not an affirmative vote and therefore will have the same effect as
a vote against this proposal.
Effective Date:   If
approved by the stockholders, the amendment to the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation would become effective upon the filing with the Secretary of
State of Delaware of a Certificate of Amendment, which is set forth in Appendix
G-2 attached hereto (in a form assuming both amendments to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation described in Proposal No. 3 and Proposal No. 4
are approved, which will be modified to the extent stockholders do not approve
both amendments), which filing is expected to take place shortly after the
stockholders approve the amendment.
Recommendation of the
Board
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote FOR this proposal to amend the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to eliminate all supermajority vote requirements. Proxies
solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted FOR this proposal unless a
contrary vote is specified.
PROPOSAL NO. 4
PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE COMPANYS RESTATED CERTIFICATE
OF INCORPORATION TO
ELIMINATE THE FAIR PRICE PROVISION
Stockholders are being asked to approve an amendment
to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the fair
price provision by deleting Article THIRTEENTH (Amendment No. 2).
Our Board, after careful consideration and upon
recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, has concluded that
it is in the best interests of the Companys stockholders 
22 


to propose Amendment No. 2
to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to repeal the fair price
provision and to request stockholder approval of that amendment.
A fair price provision is an anti-takeover measure
designed to help companies defend against certain kinds of tender offers, known
as coercive, two-tiered tender offers. In this type of takeover, a potential
acquirer will offer one price for the shares needed to gain control of a target
company and then offer a lower price or other less favorable consideration for
the remaining shares, thereby creating pressure for stockholders to tender their
shares for the tender offer price, regardless of their value. Standard fair
price provisions encourage a potential acquirer to negotiate with a companys
board of directors by requiring the potential acquirer to pay a fair price
for all shares as determined under a specified formulation, unless the acquirers
offer has satisfied specified board or stockholder approval requirements.
Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (DGCL) contains provisions that provide similar protection to those under
Article THIRTEENTH. When Article THIRTEENTH of our Restated
Certificate of Incorporation was adopted in 1986, Section 203 of the DGCL
had not yet been enacted. The Board believes the protection afforded by Section 203
of the DGCL is sufficient, and that a separate provision in the Restated Certificate
of Incorporation is no longer necessary.
After weighing all of these considerations, the
Nominating and Governance Committee recommended the elimination of the fair
price provision, and the Board agreed and determined that Amendment No. 2
is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The
Board of Directors has adopted resolutions approving and declaring the
advisability of Amendment No. 2 and recommends that the stockholders
approve Amendment No. 2 by voting in favor of this Proposal. The current fair
price provision and the proposed amendment are described in greater detail
below.
Fair Price Provision
Article THIRTEENTH of our
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is sometimes referred to as a fair
price provision, currently requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least 80 percent of the outstanding voting stock to approve certain
transactions involving any person or group that beneficially owns at least 10 percent
of our outstanding voting stock (a Related Person). Under the proposed
amendments, this Article would be deleted in its entirety. The current
requirements of Article THIRTEENTH apply to the following transactions
between a Related Person and 3M:
·       A
merger or consolidation;
·       Any
sale, lease, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of all or any substantial
part (more than five percent of the fair market value) of the assets of 3M or
any of its subsidiaries;
·       Any sale, lease, exchange,
transfer, or other disposition of all or any substantial part (more than five
percent of the fair market value) of the assets of an entity to 3M or any of
its subsidiaries;
·       The issuance, sale,
exchange, transfer, or other disposition by 3M or its subsidiaries of any
securities of 3M or its subsidiaries;
·       Any recapitalization or
reclassification of the securities of 3M or other transaction that would have
the effect of increasing the voting power of a Related Person or reducing the
number of shares of each class of voting stock outstanding; or
·       Any
liquidation, spin-off, split-off, split up, or dissolution of 3M.
This 80 percent voting requirement does not apply to (a) transactions
approved by the vote of the majority of the Continuing Directors (directors who
were directors prior to the time the Related Person became a Related Person,
and directors recommended for election by such directors) and (b) in the 
23 


case of any business
transaction involving a merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of
the assets, the aggregate amount of cash to be received per share in connection
with such business transaction is at least equal in value to the highest
price per share of common stock paid by the Related Person in the transaction
which resulted in such Related Person becoming a Related Person or within one
year prior to the date such Related Person became a Related Person, whichever
is higher. Article THIRTEENTH also includes a requirement that Article THIRTEENTH
can only be amended, altered, or repealed with the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 80 percent of all of the then outstanding shares of voting
stock, voting together as a single class.
The repeal of Article THIRTEENTH
will have two principal effects on stockholder voting: First, those
transactions covered by Article THIRTEENTH that would otherwise require a
stockholder vote under the Delaware General Corporation Law would require the
vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding stock, rather than an 80 percent
supermajority vote. Second, the Board of Directors will be able to effect, without
obtaining stockholder approval, those transactions covered by Article THIRTEENTH
that do not otherwise require stockholder approval under Delaware law.
3M will continue to be subject to Section 203 of
the Delaware General Corporation Law without regard to whether the proposed
amendments are approved. Section 203 provides, in general, that a
transaction constituting a business combination within the meaning of Section 203
involving a person owning 15 percent or more of our voting stock (referred to as
an interested stockholder), cannot be completed for a period of three years
after the date the person became an interested stockholder unless (1) the
Board of Directors approved either the business combination or the transaction
that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder prior to such
business combination or transaction, (2) upon consummation of the
transaction that resulted in the person becoming an interested stockholder,
that person owned at least 85 percent of our outstanding voting stock
(excluding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers of 3M
and shares owned by certain 3M employee benefit plans), or (3) the
business combination was approved by the Board of Directors and by the
affirmative vote of at least 662¤3 percent of
our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder.
The Board has
separately proposed to repeal other provisions of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as discussed in Proposal No. 3:
Proposal to Amend the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation to
Eliminate the Supermajority Vote Requirements. The amendments to
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation proposed under Proposal No. 3
and Proposal No. 4 are set forth in Appendix G-1, with
deletions indicated by strikeout and additions indicated by underline that will
be made to the extent stockholders approve the amendments. The current
provisions and proposed amendment described above are qualified in their
entirety by reference to the actual text as set forth in Appendix G-1.
Vote Required:   The
affirmative vote of at least 80 percent of all outstanding shares of
Common Stock is required for approval of this proposal. An abstention on this
proposal is not an affirmative vote and therefore will have the same effect as
a vote against this proposal.
Effective Date:   If
approved by the stockholders, the amendment to the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation would become effective upon the filing with the Secretary of
State of Delaware of a Certificate of Amendment, which is set forth in Appendix
G-2 attached hereto (in a form assuming both amendments to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation described in Proposal No. 3 and Proposal
No. 4 are approved, which will be modified to the extent stockholders do
not approve both amendments), which filing is expected to take place shortly
after the stockholders approve the amendment.

Recommendation of the
Board
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote FOR this proposal to amend the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to eliminate the fair price provision. Proxies solicited by the
Board of Directors will be voted FOR this proposal unless a contrary vote is
specified.
PROPOSAL NO. 5
PROPOSAL
TO APPROVE THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
At its meeting on February 11, 2007, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) adopted the
3M Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the Annual Incentive Plan or the Plan).
This Annual Incentive Plan replaces the Executive Profit Sharing Plan by which
the Company previously provided short-term incentive compensation to certain of
its executive officers. This change is part of the Companys strategy of
replacing quarterly profit sharing as its primary vehicle for delivering
short-term incentive compensation to employees with annual incentive
compensation. This strategy is intended to accomplish a number of objectives,
all of which are consistent with delivering increased stockholder value.
The Annual Incentive Plan is
intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code, so that the Company is able to deduct for federal income tax
purposes payments of annual incentive compensation made to its Named Executive Officers
(as identified in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement). In
general, Section 162(m) imposes a limit on the amount of compensation
paid to a corporations Named Executive Officers that may be deducted for federal
income tax purposes. This limit does not apply to compensation that is
considered performance-based for purposes of Section 162(m). One of the
conditions for compensation to be considered performance-based under Section
162(m) requires that the material terms under which such compensation will
be paid, including the performance goals, be disclosed to and approved by stockholders.
Thus, when the Compensation Committee adopted the Annual Incentive Plan, it
made its approval subject to the condition that the Plan be approved by a
majority vote of the Companys stockholders at the Companys next annual
meeting.
Summary of the Annual
Incentive Plan
The following is only a
summary of the material terms of the Annual Incentive Plan and is qualified in
its entirety by reference to the full plan document for the Plan, which is
attached as Appendix H to this proxy statement.
1.               What are the purposes of the Annual Incentive Plan?  The
purposes of the Plan are to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to
serve as executive officers of the Company, to focus their attention on
achieving certain business objectives established for the Company and its business
units, and to provide these individuals with incentive compensation that is
designed to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
2.               Who is eligible to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan?  Participation
in the Plan is limited to the Named Executive Officers of the Company and those
other senior executives of the Company whose compensation is approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Named Executive Officers
are those individuals covered by the SECs disclosure requirements for
executive compensation (as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in this
proxy statement).
3.               Who administers the Annual Incentive Plan?  The
Compensation Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee has full power
and authority to interpret the Plan, establish, amend 
25 


and rescind any rules, forms
or procedures as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the Plan,
determine the manner and time of payment of the annual compensation payable
under the Plan, and to take any other action as it deems necessary or advisable
in connection with the Plan. The Committee may delegate any of its
administrative responsibilities in connection with the Plan to the appropriate
employees of the Company.
4.               How are the amounts of annual incentive compensation paid under the
Plan determined?  The Plan establishes limits on the maximum
annual incentive payable to any participating individual for any year. For the Named
Executive Officers of the Company, this limit is one quarter of one percent
(0.25%) of the adjusted net income of the Company for the year. For all other
individuals participating in the Plan, this limit is one tenth of one percent
(0.1%) of the adjusted net income of the Company for the year. Subject to these
limits, the Committee determines the amount of each individuals annual
incentive opportunity for each year and has the discretion to reduce the annual
incentive payable to such individual below the applicable limit.
5.               How are annual incentive compensation payments made under the Plan?  Payments
may be made in the form of cash or in the form of shares of 3M common stock,
restricted stock, or restricted stock units delivered pursuant to the Companys
Management Stock Ownership Program. All payments for a year will be made no
later than March 15 of the following year, but not until the Committee has
certified in writing that the performance goal for the year has been satisfied
and that the limits on the maximum annual incentive payable to any individual
participating in the Plan have not been exceeded.
6.               Under what circumstances may an individual lose the right to receive
annual incentive compensation under the Plan?  If an
individuals employment with 3M ends for any reason other than retirement or
death, that individuals participation in the Plan will end and any annual
incentive compensation that would otherwise have been payable to such
individual for the year in which his or her employment ended will be forfeited.
7.               What are the federal income tax consequences of the annual incentive
compensation paid under the Plan?  Annual incentive compensation
payments made in cash or shares of 3M common stock will be taxed to the
recipient as ordinary income in the year of receipt. Annual incentive
compensation delivered in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock
units will be taxed to the recipient as ordinary income when the shares of
restricted stock or the restricted stock units vest. Assuming that 3Ms
stockholders approve the Plan and that the other requirements for
performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal
Revenue Code are satisfied, the Company will be entitled to a deduction for federal
income tax purposes equal to the amount of income recognized by participants in
the Plan in each year that such income is recognized.
8.               How long will the Annual Incentive Plan remain in effect, and may it be
changed?  The Plan became effective on January 1, 2007,
subject to the requirement that it be approved by a majority vote of the
Companys stockholders at the Companys next annual meeting. Once approved, the
Plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Compensation Committee. The
Committee may amend the Plan at any time, except that no amendment which would (a) increase
the limit on the annual incentive compensation payable to any participant, or (b) revise
the performance goal available for determining the amount of annual incentive
compensation payable under the Plan, will become effective until it has been
approved by a majority vote of the Companys stockholders.
26 


Recommendation of the
Board
The Board of Directors
recommends a vote FOR the proposal to approve the adoption of the 3M
Executive Annual Incentive Plan as well as the material terms under which
compensation would be paid to individuals participating in such 3M Plan. Proxies
solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted FOR this proposal unless a
contrary vote is specified.
The affirmative FOR vote of a majority of those
shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to
vote is required to approve this proposal. If the proposal is not approved, the
Committee would need to decide whether to implement the Annual Incentive Plan
without stockholder approval, resume the previous Executive Profit Sharing Plan,
or select another method of delivering short-term incentive compensation.
PROPOSAL
NO. 6
PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE
MATERIAL TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
UNDER THE PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN
As described in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, the Performance Unit Plan is one element of the Companys
compensation program for its executives. The Plan provides long-term incentive
compensation payable annually based on the Companys attainment of the
performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee for each years
awards. This performance is measured over rolling three-year periods.
The Plan was first
approved by the Companys stockholders in 1981, and they have since approved
amendments to the Plan in 1994, 1997, and 2002. The last amendment expanded the
available performance criteria to include improvement in economic profit as well
as improvements in certain asset or financial measures. The performance
criteria used in making awards under the Plan since 2005 have been improvement
in economic profit and real worldwide sales growth.
At its meeting on February 11, 2007, the
Compensation Committee approved an amendment to the Plan which amends the
available performance criteria to include adjusted net income or improvement in
adjusted net income, earnings per share or improvement in earnings per share,
net sales, cash flow, gross margin, operating margin, earnings before interest
and taxes, EBITDA, economic value added, stock price, return on assets or net
assets, and operating income or improvement in operating income. As amended,
the performance criteria available to the Compensation Committee under the Plan
now include return on capital employed, return on assets or net assets, net
sales, sales growth, cash flow, earnings per share or improvement in earnings
per share, return on equity, stock price, gross margin, operating margin, total
shareholder return, economic value added, economic profit or improvement in
economic profit, earnings before interest and taxes, EBITDA, operating income
or improvement in operating income, improvements in certain asset or financial
measures, reductions in certain asset or cost areas, net income or variations
of net income in varying time periods, and comparisons with other peer
companies or industry groups or classifications with regard to one or more of
these criteria. As amended, the criteria may now apply either to the Company as
a whole or to any of its business segments.
In order to preserve the
Companys ability to deduct for federal income tax purposes the payments made
under the Plan to certain of its executives, Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code and the regulations issued thereunder require that the
Companys stockholders approve the material terms of these performance criteria
as amended by the Compensation Committee.
27 


Recommendation of the
Board
The Board of Directors
recommends a vote FOR the proposal to approve the material terms of the
performance criteria under the Performance Unit Plan. Proxies solicited by the
Board of Directors will be voted FOR this proposal unless a contrary vote is
specified.
The affirmative FOR vote of
a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve this proposal. If the
proposal is not approved, the available performance criteria under the Plan
will remain the same; however, some of the compensation paid to certain
executives under the Plan may not be deductible, resulting in additional costs
to the Company.
PROPOSAL
NO. 7
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL ON
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF PEER COMPANIES
3M has received a stockholder proposal from the United
Brotherhood of Carpenters Pension Fund (the Proponent). The Proponent has
requested the Company to include the following proposal and supporting
statement in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The
proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by
the Proponent or the Proponents qualified representative.
Proponents Proposal:
Resolved: That the shareholders of 3M Company (Company)
request that the Board of Directors Executive Compensation Committee establish
a pay-for-superior-performance standard in the Companys executive compensation
plan for senior executives (Plan), by incorporating the following principles
into the Plan:
1.               The
annual incentive or bonus component of the Plan should utilize defined
financial performance criteria benchmarked against a disclosed peer group of
companies, and provide that an annual bonus should be awarded only when the
Companys performance exceeds its peers median or mean performance on the
selected financial criteria;
2.               The
long-term compensation component of the Plan should utilize defined financial
and/or stock price performance criteria benchmarked against a disclosed peer
group of companies. Options, restricted shares, or other equity or non-equity
compensation used in the Plan should be structured so that compensation is
received only when the Companys performance exceeds its peers median or mean
performance on the selected financial and stock price performance criteria; and
3.               Plan
disclosure should be sufficient to allow shareholders to determine and monitor
the pay and performance correlation established in the Plan.
Supporting Statement:
We feel it is
imperative that compensation plans for senior executives be designed and
implemented to promote long-term corporate value. A critical design feature of
a well-conceived executive compensation plan is a close correlation between the
level of pay and the level of corporate performance relative to industry peers.
We believe the failure to tie executive compensation to superior corporate
performance; that is, performance exceeding peer group performance, has fueled
the escalation of executive compensation and detracted from the goal of
enhancing long-term corporate value.
28 


We believe that common
compensation practices have contributed to excessive executive compensation.
Compensation committees typically target senior executive total compensation at
the median level of a selected peer group, then they design any annual and
long-term incentive plan performance criteria and benchmarks to deliver a
significant portion of the total compensation target regardless of the companys
performance relative to its peers. High total compensation targets combined
with less than rigorous performance benchmarks yield a pattern of
superior-pay-for-average-performance. The problem is exacerbated when companies
include annual bonus payments among earnings used to calculate supplemental
executive retirement plan (SERP) benefit levels, guaranteeing excessive levels
of lifetime income through inflated pension payments.
We believe the Companys Plan fails to promote the
pay-for-superior-performance principle. Our Proposal offers a straightforward
solution: The Compensation Committee should establish and disclose financial
and stock price performance criteria and set peer group-related performance
benchmarks that permit awards or payouts in its annual and long-term incentive
compensation plans only when the Companys performance exceeds the median of
its peer group. A senior executive compensation plan based on sound
pay-for-superior-performance principles will help moderate excessive executive
compensation and create competitive compensation incentives that will focus
senior executives on building sustainable long-term corporate value.
Boards Statement
Opposing the Proposal
After careful consideration, and for the reasons set
forth below, the Board believes that the proposal to require the Compensation
Committee (the Committee) to establish a pay-for-superior-performance
standard by using the performance of peer companies in addition to 3Ms
performance to determine the amount of payments under 3Ms performance-based
compensation plans for senior executives is not in the best interests of 3M or
its stockholders for the following reasons:
1.               3Ms compensation
program for its executives does not provide excessive executive compensation
as implied by this proposal. As described in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis, the Compensation Committee relies on frequent and multiple surveys of
the executive compensation practices of a premier group of comparator companies
to ensure that the compensation delivered to 3Ms executives remains
competitive with and in the appropriate relationship to such compensation at
these comparator companies. When these surveys reveal that the compensation
paid to executives at these comparator companies declines, as it recently did
with respect to long-term incentive compensation, the long-term incentive
compensation provided by 3M to its executives declines as well.
2.               Total compensation
must be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M; motivate employees to
perform at their highest levels; reward outstanding achievement; and retain
those individuals with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for
building long-term stockholder value. Senior executives are effectively
motivated when their performance-based compensation is directly tied to 3Ms
performance and not to the performance of peer companies over which 3Ms
senior executives have no control. Compensation plans that would pay nothing
for outstanding performance that merely matched the performance of 3Ms peer
companies would not accomplish these purposes. Linking 3Ms executive
compensation to the Companys relative performance as compared to peer
companies may have unintended and undesirable consequences due to the varying
and unforeseeable circumstances that may impact such other companies.
3.               3M
already believes strongly in, and has a long history of, linking executive
compensation to Company performance. The Board believes that 3Ms current
performance-based compensation programs work well and have been a strong
contributing factor to the Companys success over the years, providing real
value to its stockholders. The Board 
29 


believes that it is in
the best interests of stockholders to give the Committee the flexibility and
discretion to use performance-based compensation and equity incentive tools as
appropriate based on the circumstances and information available at the time.
For this reason and the other reasons stated above, the Board believes that the
adoption of the stockholder proposal is unnecessary and would be detrimental to
the long-term interests of the Companys stockholders.
Recommendation of the
Board
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST
this proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies solicited by the Board
of Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a stockholder
indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL
OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers to
file with the Securities Exchange Commission reports regarding their ownership
and changes in ownership of our stock. 3M believes that during 2006, its
directors and executive officers complied with all
Section 16(a) filing requirements. In making this statement, 3M has
relied upon examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5 and the written
representations of its directors and executive officers.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion
and Analysis
Overview
3M pays its executives compensation to recognize their
contributions to the success of its business and provide incentives for them to
deliver performance that meets the growth and other objectives of the Company.
All elements of this compensation are determined by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors (the Committee), which is composed solely of
independent nonemployee directors. However, the Committees decisions
concerning the compensation of 3Ms Chief Executive Officer are subject to
ratification by the independent directors of the Board of Directors.
32




As of December 31, 2006, the members of the
Committee were Vance D. Coffman, Robert S. Morrison, Aulana L. Peters, Rozanne
L. Ridgway, and Kevin W. Sharer. The Committee operates pursuant to a Charter
attached to this proxy statement as Appendix D. During 2006, the Committee was
assisted by its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. In addition to participating in the
meetings of the Committee, Mr. Paulin provided significant assistance and
advice during an extensive review of the Companys short-term and long-term
incentive compensation plans. Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., along
with two other compensation consulting firms, provides executive compensation
survey data relied upon by the Committee in establishing competitive
compensation for 3Ms executives.
3Ms executive officers
(especially Mr. Buckley) assist the Committee with the process of
determining the compensation of the Companys executives.
Objectives of 3Ms
compensation program
3M believes that the
compensation of its executives should be closely tied to the performance and
growth of the Company, so that their interests are aligned with the interests
of 3M stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the following core
principles provide a framework for the Companys executive compensation
program:
·       Total
compensation must be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M, motivate
executives to perform at their highest levels, reward outstanding achievement,
and retain those individuals with the leadership abilities and skills necessary
for building long-term stockholder value;
·       The
portion of an executives total compensation that varies with performance and
is therefore at risk should increase with the level of an individuals
responsibility;
·       The
goals for any variable pay plans must be consistent with the Companys business
objectives and increasing stockholder value; and
·       Executives
are most effectively motivated to build long-term stockholder value when a
significant portion of their personal net worth is invested in 3M stock.
In order to accomplish the
objective of providing competitive total compensation, 3M annually surveys the
executive compensation practices of a premier group of comparator companies. The
survey data is obtained from three independent consultants (Hewitt Associates,
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc., and Towers Perrin). With this
information, the Committee aims to provide the Companys executives with
short-term cash compensation at or very close to the median of this comparator
group and long-term incentive compensation at the average of the 50th and 75th percentiles of
this comparator group. The comparator group consists of the companies in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, modified to exclude financial services companies,
and other companies with annual revenue exceeding $10 billion that participate
in the consultants executive compensation surveys. Survey data is adjusted to
recognize the different sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual
revenues) as compared to the size of 3M.
What the compensation
program is designed to reward
3Ms executive compensation
program is designed to link individual rewards to the profitability and growth
of the Companys business. 3M believes that an individuals pay should reflect
his or her sustained performance and contributions to the Company. The program
is also designed to reward increasing stockholder value through a combination
of equity and cash based long-term incentives. All of the incentive
compensation elements of the program are designed to incent performance that
meets or exceeds the growth and profitability objectives of the Company.
33 


Elements of the
compensation program
During 2006, the compensation program for 3Ms
executives consisted of the following elements: base salary, short-term cash
incentive in the form of profit sharing, long-term cash incentive in the form
of a Performance Unit Plan, and long-term equity incentive in the form of stock
options (and in appropriate circumstances, restricted stock or restricted stock
units). These executives also participated in various benefit plans made
available to most of 3Ms U.S. employees, were eligible to participate in
several deferred compensation plans, and received other benefits and
perquisites. The entire program applied to approximately 110 executives during
2006, including all five of the individuals named in the Summary Compensation
Table (George W. Buckley, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive
Officer; Patrick D. Campbell, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;
Moe S. Nozari, Executive Vice President, Consumer and Office Business;
Frederick J. Palensky, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and
Chief Technology Officer; and Richard F. Ziegler, Senior Vice President, Legal
Affairs and General Counsel).
Base salary
3M pays each of its executives
a base salary in cash on a monthly basis. The amount of this base salary is
reviewed annually, and does not necessarily vary with the performance of the
Company.
Short-term incentive
During 2006, 3M provided short-term incentive
compensation to its executives and many other global employees through profit
sharing plans. Profit sharing is performance-based compensation based on the
quarterly economic profit of the Company and its business units. Economic
profit is defined as quarterly net operating income minus a charge for
operating capital used by the business. The economic profit measurement is
directly related to the creation of stockholder value since it emphasizes the
effective use of capital and solid profitable growth. Compensation paid under
the profit sharing plans fluctuates based on the performance of the Company and
its business units. All profit sharing payments are made in cash.
Following a comprehensive review of 3Ms short-term
and long-term incentive compensation plans, the Committee has decided to
replace the current profit sharing plans with an annual incentive plan. The new
annual incentive plan will be based on three performance metrics: organic
growth, operating income, and economic profit. This change will be effective in
2007 for the Companys executives and in 2008 for the remaining employees
currently participating in the profit sharing plans. Implementation of the new
plan is being phased in over a two-year period due to the extensive revisions
in 3Ms financial and human resource information systems necessary to
administer the plan.
Long-term incentives
3M provides long-term incentive compensation to its
executives through its Performance Unit Plan and its Management Stock Ownership
Program. Both plans deliver performance-based compensation to these executives,
although the basis for measuring this performance varies by plan.
The Performance Unit Plan provides variable
compensation to 3Ms executives based on the Companys long-term performance. The
Committee makes annual awards of performance units under the Plan to these
executives. The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted is
determined by and is contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria
selected each year by the Committee over the applicable three-year performance
period. Although the Plan authorizes the payment of performance units in either
cash or shares of 3M common stock, the Company has consistently made these
payments in the form of cash.
34 


The Management Stock Ownership Program provides
compensation to 3Ms executives based on the value of and increases in the
value of the Companys common stock. The Program authorizes the Committee to
grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights, and other stock awards to management employees of the
Company. The Committee makes annual grants of stock options under the Program
to 3Ms executives and other management employees. These options have an
exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys common stock on the
grant date, and generally expire ten years after the grant date. Historically,
the Committee has made grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units
under the Program only to selected executives and other management employees in
appropriate circumstances. These circumstances have included the hiring of new
executives as well as the need to retain current executives. These shares of
restricted stock and restricted stock units vest over periods ranging from one
to five years after the grant date, which encourage the executives to remain
employed by the Company until the shares or units have vested.
In addition to annual stock option grants, executives
who exercise nonqualified stock options granted before 2005 may qualify for the
receipt of new progressive stock options (also known as reloads). When an
executive exercises a nonqualified option granted before 2005 and pays the
exercise price of such option using shares of 3M common stock already owned by
the executive (a method of exercise known as a stock swap), the executive is
automatically granted a new progressive stock option for the number of shares
used to pay the exercise price as well as the number of shares withheld to pay
withholding taxes. The new progressive stock option carries an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of a share of 3M common stock on the date of exercise
of the pre-2005 nonqualified stock option, and may only be exercised
through the original expiration date of such pre-2005 nonqualified stock
option. 3M offered progressive stock options with respect to nonqualified stock
options granted before 2005 to encourage executives to acquire and accumulate
actual shares of 3M common stock by exercising their stock options early rather
than holding such options until the end of their term and then exercising them
for cash. Stock options granted since 2004 have not been eligible for the grant
of new progressive stock options upon their exercise.
New progressive stock option
grants are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of
Plan-Based Awards Table for those Named Executive Officers who received them
during 2006. The values for such grants reflected in these Tables were
determined in accordance with FAS 123(R). However, the Committee did not
consider these new progressive stock option grants to represent incremental
compensation value when determining an individuals annual stock option grant
for 2006, because the progressive stock options are merely extensions of the
exercised pre-2005 nonqualified stock options.
Benefits and
perquisites
3Ms executives participate in most of the same health
care, disability, life insurance, pension, and 401(k) benefit plans made
available generally to the Companys U.S. employees. In addition, these
executives are eligible to participate in several deferred compensation
programs that allow them to voluntarily defer the receipt of cash compensation
otherwise payable by the Company. These deferred compensation programs enable
participating executives to earn the same returns paid on the investment funds
offered to participants in the Companys 401(k) plan or, at the executives
election, a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields. Payment of
this deferred compensation and the earnings thereon generally occurs following
the end of the executives employment with the Company. Executives also receive
perquisites described in more detail in footnote 5 to the Summary
Compensation Table. Three executives (Mr. Buckley, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Ziegler)
earn supplemental retirement benefits pursuant to their employment agreements
with the Company, which were negotiated at the time they agreed to leave their
previous employers and join 3M. These supplemental benefits are designed to
replace a portion of the pension benefits they failed to earn 
35 


under the
plans of their previous employers because they ended their employment before
becoming eligible to retire.
Why 3M chooses to pay
each element
3M pays base salary as the
core of its executives cash compensation, which is necessary to provide
competitive total compensation. 3M pays additional cash compensation through a
short-term incentive in order to recognize and reward improving business
performance. 3M provides long-term incentive compensation through awards under
its Performance Unit Plan in order to increase its executives focus on and
recognize their leadership role in achieving the performance goals selected by
the Committee, which are regarded as critical for creating sustainable stockholder
value over time. 3M also provides long-term incentive compensation through
stock options and restricted stock grants under the Management Stock Ownership
Program to better align the interests of its executives with the Companys stockholders,
encourage 3M stock ownership and reward executives for appreciation in 3Ms
stock price.
How 3M determines the
amount for each element
All amounts are determined by
the Committee in recognition of the Companys annual surveys of the compensation
practices of its comparator companies (with the exception of the compensation
of Mr. Buckley, which was determined through the negotiation of his
employment agreement when he agreed to join the Company as 3Ms Chief Executive
Officer in December 2005). With this information, the Committee aims to
provide short-term cash compensation that is at or very close to the median of
this comparator group and long-term incentive compensation at the average of
the 50th and 75th percentiles of
this comparator group. By targeting long-term incentive compensation at the
average of the 50th and 75th percentiles of
this comparator group, 3M is able to reward good performance with long-term
awards closer to the 50th percentile and outstanding performance with
long-term awards closer to the 75th percentile.
Base salary
Changes in the base salaries
of executives are considered annually by the Committee. Any adjustments are
made in recognition of changing conditions in the external market along with
the individuals performance during the preceding annual period. Excluding Mr. Buckley
(who did not receive an increase during 2006), the Committee increased the base
salaries for the executives named in the Summary Compensation Table by an
average of 8.1 percent during 2006.
Short-term incentive
During 2006, the Committee chose to deliver short-term
incentive compensation in the form of quarterly profit sharing. Profit sharing
payouts were based on a single metric, economic profit, although economic
profit was measured at different levels of the Company. All executives received
at least a portion of their profit sharing based on the quarterly economic
profit of the Company as a whole, while some executives received a portion of
their profit sharing based on the quarterly economic profit of their respective
business units. Mr. Buckleys target annual profit sharing was established
in his employment agreement at $2,600,000, or 162 percent of his annual base
salary, and has not subsequently been changed. The target annual planned profit
sharing for the other executives named in the Summary Compensation Table was
established at 67 percent of their annual base salaries.
Total economic profit of the
Company for 2006 amounted to $1.998 billion, an increase of 2 percent over
3Ms total economic profit for 2005. As a result, the profit sharing payments
made to those executives who received profit sharing based solely on the
results of the Company as a whole 
36 


throughout
the entire year were 102 percent of their target annual planned profit sharing
for the year. For example, Mr. Buckley received profit sharing payments of
$2,654,408 for 2006, 2 percent above his target annual planned profit sharing
of $2,600,000.
Long-term incentives
During 2006, the Committee chose to deliver two-thirds
of the value of the long-term incentive compensation provided to 3Ms
executives (other than Mr. Buckley, whose amounts were determined through
the negotiation of his employment agreement) in the form of stock options and
the remaining one-third in the form of awards under the Performance Unit Plan. Starting
in 2007, the Committee intends to change this mix so that one-half of the value
of these executives long-term incentive compensation is delivered through
stock options and the other one-half is delivered through awards under the
Performance Unit Plan. This change is being made to better balance rewards for
long-term financial performance with the rewards for stock price appreciation.
The Committee takes into
account and recognizes individual performance in determining the size of annual
stock option grants under the Management Stock Ownership Program. Once the
desired value of the annual grant is determined for each executive, the value
is converted into a number of option shares by dividing this amount by a Black-Scholes
value that is the average of the Black-Scholes values for 3M stock options as
provided by three independent consultants (Hewitt Associates, Frederic W.
Cook & Co., Inc., and Towers Perrin). Annual stock option grants
occur on the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May, and the
exercise price for these options is set at the fair market value of a share of
3M stock on that date (as required by the provisions of the Management Stock
Ownership Program last approved by 3Ms stockholders in 2005). As provided in
the plan document for the Management Stock Ownership Program, the fair market
value of a share of 3M stock is computed as the average of the high and low
prices at which 3M common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange, rounded
up to the nearest $0.05. Annual stock options granted under this Program expire
ten years after the grant date, and become exercisable in equal installments on
the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
During 2006, the Committee approved a special grant of
7,500 shares of restricted stock to Dr. Nozari for retention purposes. These
shares of restricted stock will vest on June 12, 2009 (or upon Dr. Nozaris
retirement from the Company, with the consent of the Nominating and Governance
Committee of the Board of Directors, if earlier), if he remains employed by the
Company until that date.
As part of their approval of the Performance Unit
Plan, 3Ms stockholders authorized the Committee to select the performance
criteria for each years units awarded under the Plan from a set of preapproved
measures. These preapproved measures include return on capital employed, sales
growth, return on equity, total shareholder return, and economic profit or
improvement in economic profit. The performance criteria selected by the
Committee for performance units granted during 2006 were designed to focus
management attention on two key factors that create stockholder value: Economic
Profit Growth and Sales Growth.
Economic Profit Growth is the average annual
percentage amount by which the economic profit of the Company grows over the
three-year measurement period (2006 through 2008 for the performance units
granted during 2006). Sales Growth is the average annual percentage amount
by which the Companys worldwide organic sales growth (sales growth adjusted
for acquisitions, inflation, and currency effects) exceeds worldwide real sales
growth as reflected in the Industrial Production Index, as published by the
Federal Reserve, during the three-year measurement period.
The amount payable for each performance unit granted
in 2006 is linked to the performance criteria of Economic Profit Growth and
Sales Growth, with approximately 60 percent of this amount determined by
Economic Profit Growth and the remaining 40 percent determined by Sales Growth.

37 


The amount payable may be
anywhere from $0 to $360 per unit, depending on the performance of the Company
during the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2008.
The
Committee approved the following formula for determining the amount payable for
these performance units:

The above formula is
not a prediction of how 3M will perform during the years 2006 through 2008. The
sole purpose of this formula, which was approved by the Committee in February 2006,
is to establish a method for determining the payment of long-term incentive
compensation under the Performance Unit Plan. 3M is not providing any guidance,
nor updating any prior guidance, of its future performance with the disclosure
of this formula, and you are cautioned not to rely on this formula as a
prediction of 3Ms future performance.
Benefits and
perquisites
3M provides benefits to its
executives and its other employees for the purposes of delivering competitive
total compensation and protecting the health and welfare of these employees and
their families. Perquisites are provided for a variety of reasons, including
the delivery of competitive total compensation and protecting the health and
safety of key employees.
How each element and the decisions regarding that
element fit into the Companys overall compensation objectives, and affect
decisions regarding other elements
All elements of 3Ms
compensation program, including base salary, short-term incentive, long-term
incentives, benefits, and perquisites, are designed to provide overall value at
or above the median of 3Ms comparator group of premier companies. By doing so,
3M is able to attract and retain the talent necessary to lead and grow the Company.
In addition, the incentive compensation elements are designed to recognize the
uniqueness and diversity of 3Ms businesses while supporting the Companys
overall business objectives and focus on increasing stockholder value.
Stock ownership guidelines
The Companys stock ownership
guidelines apply to all Section 16 Reporting Officers. They are designed
to increase an executives equity stake in 3M and more closely align his or her
interests with those of 3Ms stockholders. The guidelines provide that the CEO
should attain beneficial ownership of 3M stock equal to five times his or her
annual base salary at the time of appointment, Executive and Senior Vice
Presidents should attain beneficial ownership of 3M stock equal to three times
their annual base salary at the time of appointment, and Vice Presidents should
attain beneficial ownership of 3M stock equal to two times their annual base
salary at the time of appointment. While the stock ownership guidelines provide
that executives should attain this beneficial ownership of 3M stock within five
years of their appointment to these positions, most of our executives have
already attained or exceeded these ownership levels. During 2006, the Committee
decided that beginning in 2007, future payments of performance units awarded
under the Performance Unit Plan will be made in shares of 3M stock instead of
cash to the extent an executive has not met these stock ownership guidelines.
38 


Policy on reimbursement
of incentive payments (Clawback)
The Companys Board of
Directors has adopted a policy requiring the reimbursement of excess payments
made to an executive in the event that 3M is required to make a material
restatement of its financial statements and that executives intentional
misconduct caused the need for the restatement. This policy applies to the Section 16
officers of the Company. The policy has been filed electronically with the
Companys most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.17.
Limit on tax-deductible
compensation
Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code prohibits 3M from deducting compensation paid in any year
to an executive named in the Summary Compensation Table in excess of $1
million, but does not subject performance-based compensation to this limit. The
Committee continues to emphasize performance-based compensation for executives
and thus minimize the effect of Section 162(m). However, the Committee
believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program
that attracts, retains, and rewards the executive talent necessary for the
Companys success. Consequently, in any year the Committee may authorize
nonperformance-based compensation in excess of $1 million. The Committee
recognizes that the loss of the tax deduction may be unavoidable under these
circumstances.
Severance or change in
control arrangements
With the exception of three Named Executive Officers
who have entered into employment agreements with the Company, 3M does not have
severance plans or arrangements with any of its executives. Nor does 3M have
arrangements providing for payments or other compensation in the event of a
change in control of the Company, other than the payment, exercise, or delivery
of long-term incentive compensation awards issued prior to a change in control.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
REPORT
In accordance with the SECs disclosure requirements
for executive compensation, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of 3M Company (the Committee) has reviewed and discussed with 3M
Management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on this review and
these discussions with 3M Management, the Committee recommended to the Board of
Directors that this Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the
2007 proxy statement of 3M Company.

purposes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, in accordance with
FAS 123(R), (excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures related to
service-based vesting conditions), for awards pursuant to the Management Stock
Ownership Program, and thus may include amounts attributable to awards granted
during and before 2006. Assumptions made in the calculation of these amounts
are included in Note 16 to the Companys audited financial statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, included in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 26, 2007.
40 


(3)  The amounts in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column
reflect the sum of (i) profit sharing earned during 2006 under the Companys
profit sharing plans, (ii) the value of awards made under the Performance
Unit Plan, which were earned during 2006 upon the completion of the respective
performance period (the three-year period ended December 31, 2006),
and (iii) only with respect to Dr. Palensky, earnings on a previous
award made under the Performance Unit Plan which had already been earned but
which was not paid to him until 2007.
(4)  The amounts in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Earnings column reflect the actuarial increase in the
present value of each individuals pension benefits under all defined benefit
pension plans of the Company determined using the same interest rate and
mortality assumptions as those used for financial statement reporting purposes.
There were no above-market earnings on deferred compensation under the Companys
nonqualified deferred compensation programs.
(5)  The amounts in the All Other Compensation
column reflect for each individual: (a) Company contributions made on
behalf of the individual under all of the Companys qualified and nonqualified
defined contribution plans, (b) the dollar amount of premiums paid on
behalf of the individual under the whole life or universal life insurance
policies issued to them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan, (c)  tax
gross-ups on income imputed to the individual for travel by the individuals
spouse on corporate aircraft to attend certain Company functions involving
spouse participation, and (d) amounts paid to provide the individual with
financial planning services. Mr. Campbells amount includes $18,174 of
Company contributions under its defined contribution plans and $62,151 of
premiums paid under such life insurance policies. Dr. Nozaris amount
includes $36,906 of premiums paid under such life insurance policies. Dr. Palenskys
amount includes $20,462 of premiums paid under such life insurance policies.
Mr. Zieglers amount includes $18,791 of Company contributions under its
defined contribution plans and $84,654 of premiums paid under such life
insurance policies. Mr. Buckleys amount includes $87,860 of premiums paid
under such life insurance policies, in addition to $123,422 for the
reimbursement of legal fees pursuant to his employment agreement and the
Companys relocation program, $44,966 for vehicle rentals and the value
attributable to personal use of Company-provided automobiles and ground
transportation, $224,460 for the incremental cost to the Company of his
personal use of corporate aircraft (much of which occurred during the first
part of 2006 when he commuted between Minnesota and his home in Illinois until
his family completed its move to Minnesota), and $122,178 in tax gross-ups paid
on his behalf pursuant to his employment agreement and the Companys relocation
program. In addition, the amount reported in the All Other Compensation column
for Mr. Buckley reflects the following additional types of personal
benefits: payment of housing and other living expenses in Minnesota before
he purchased a home, security provided at his personal residence, and personal
use of the Companys conference center. The incremental cost to the Company of
Mr. Buckleys personal use of corporate aircraft was calculated by
combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of
fuel, landing fees, on-board catering and crew travel expenses.
(6)  The amount in the Bonus column for Mr. Buckley reflects a cash
payment made to him (pursuant to his employment agreement) to replace the
annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation he forfeited as a result of
leaving his previous employer.

FOOTNOTES
TO GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE
(1) The amounts in the Units column reflect the numbers of Performance
Unit Plan units granted to each individual during 2006.
(2) The amounts shown as the Estimated Future
Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards reflect the minimum, target, and
maximum potential values of the performance units granted to each individual
during 2006 under the Performance Unit Plan. The actual values of these units
will be determined by the performance of the Company during the three-year
performance period of 2006, 2007, and 2008, as measured against two performance
criteria selected by the Compensation Committee. The first of these criteria,
Economic Profit Growth, requires that the average annual increase in the
Companys Economic Profit (net operating income, excluding any special items,
minus a charge for the cost of capital) over the three-year performance
period be at least five percent in order for participants to receive any payout
under this portion of the units. The second of these criteria, Sales Growth,
requires that the average annual increase in the Companys organic sales (total
sales adjusted for acquisitions, inflation, and currency effects) over the three-year
performance period at least equal the rate of worldwide real sales growth as
reflected in the Industrial Production Index published by the Federal Reserve
in order for participants to receive any payout under this portion of the units.
For more information on the formula for determining the value of these units
and on the provisions of the Performance Unit Plan in general, refer to the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
(3) The amounts shown as the Estimated Future
Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards reflect the numbers of nonqualified
stock options granted to each individual during 2006 under the Management Stock
Ownership Program. The options granted on May 9, 2006 were part of the
Companys annual grant of stock options to the more than 10,000 employees
participating in the Program, while the options granted on the other dates
shown in this table reflect progressive stock options (commonly referred to as
reloads) issued upon the exercise of options granted under 
42 


pre-2005 versions of the
Management Stock Ownership Program which provided for the receipt of such
reloads when the optionee makes payment of the exercise price in shares of the
Companys common stock.
(4) The exercise price for all stock options
granted under the Program is set at the fair market value of a share of 3M
common stock on the option grant date (as required by the provisions of the
Management Stock Ownership Program last approved by 3Ms stockholders in 2005).
As provided in the plan document for the Management Stock Ownership Program,
the fair market value of a share of 3M common stock is computed as the average
of the high and low prices at which 3M common stock traded on the New York
Stock Exchange on the applicable date (rounded up to the nearest $0.05).
(5) The amounts in the Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards
column were determined in accordance with FAS 123(R). Assumptions made in the
calculation of these amounts are included in Note 16 to the Companys audited
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, included
in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2007.
(6) These amounts reflect additional grants of restricted stock units to
Mr. Buckley in lieu of dividend payments on a portion of his outstanding
restricted stock units, as required by his employment agreement.
(7) This amount reflects a special restricted stock grant to Dr. Nozari
described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EMPLOYMENT
AGREEMENTS OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Some of the grants and compensation reflected in the
above tables are a direct result of the employment agreements that the Company
has entered into with three of the Named Executive Officers. The following
summary identifies the material terms of these agreements that impacted the
compensation or grants of these individuals during 2006.
George W. Buckley
3M has entered into an
employment agreement with George W. Buckley providing for his employment as
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and for his election as
Chairman of the Board of Directors of 3M. The agreement became effective December 6,
2005, and has an initial term of three years. Beginning on December 6, 2006,
the agreement automatically extends itself so that the remaining term of the
agreement is always two years. However, the term will end on Mr. Buckleys
65th birthday (February 23, 2012) unless the parties otherwise agree.
The
agreement requires that Mr. Buckley receive an annual base salary of
$1,600,000. This base salary will be reviewed at least annually and may be
increased by the Compensation Committee of the Board, but may not be decreased
without Mr. Buckleys consent. The agreement also requires that Mr. Buckley
be eligible to participate in the Companys Executive Profit Sharing Plan, with
a target annual bonus which is the greater of $2,600,000 and 150 percent of his
annual base salary. For 2006 only, the agreement provided that the amount of Mr. Buckleys
profit sharing compensation could not be less than $2,600,000.
Pursuant to the agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Buckley
nonqualified options to purchase 250,000 shares of 3M common stock at the fair
market value of a share of 3M common stock on the effective date of such
agreement ($78.15). These options have a ten-year term, and become exercisable
in increments of 20 percent on each of the first five anniversaries of the
grant date assuming continued employment with the Company. These options become
vested and exercisable 
43 


in full upon Mr. Buckleys death or termination due to
disability, upon a termination of his employment by the Company without Cause,
upon a termination of his employment by Mr. Buckley for Good Reason, or upon a
change of control of the Company.
Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Buckley
was also granted as of the agreements effective date 50,000 restricted stock
units with respect to shares of 3M common stock. These restricted stock units
will vest in increments of 20 percent on each of the first five anniversaries
of the grant date assuming continued employment with the Company. Dividend
equivalents in the form of additional restricted stock units will be provided
during the vesting period. These restricted stock units become vested in full
upon Mr. Buckleys death or termination due to disability, upon a
termination of his employment by the Company without Cause, upon a termination
of his employment by Mr. Buckley for Good Reason, or upon a change of
control of the Company.
The
agreement required that Mr. Buckley receive a 2006 grant of nonqualified
stock options having a Black-Scholes value of $6,000,000.
Pursuant to
the agreement, the Company granted to Mr. Buckley as of the agreements
effective date 16,667 performance units under 3Ms Performance Unit Plan with
respect to each of the performance periods beginning in 2004 and 2005. Upon the
completion of the performance period for the 2004 units (at the end of 2006), Mr. Buckley
became entitled to receive payment for one-third of the value of such units. Assuming
that he remains employed by the Company through the end of the performance
period for the 2005 units, Mr. Buckley will receive payment for two-thirds
of the value of the 2005 units in early 2008.
The agreement required that Mr. Buckley
receive a grant of 16,667 performance units under the Performance Unit Plan
with respect to the three-year performance period beginning in 2006.
In order to
replace the unvested restricted stock units that he forfeited as a result of leaving
his previous employer, the agreement required the Company to grant Mr. Buckley
(on the effective date of the agreement) 157,808 restricted stock units with
respect to shares of 3M common stock. 25,000 of these restricted stock units
vested on December 31, 2006, and the remaining 132,808 restricted stock
units will vest on December 6, 2010, assuming continued employment with
the Company. Dividend equivalents in the form of cash will be paid to Mr. Buckley
during the vesting period. These restricted stock units become vested in full
upon Mr. Buckleys death or termination due to disability, upon a
termination of his employment by the Company without Cause, upon a termination
of his employment by Mr. Buckley for Good Reason, or upon a change of
control of the Company.
In order to replace the
annual bonus and long-term incentive compensation that he forfeited as a result
of leaving his previous employer, the agreement required the Company to pay Mr.
Buckley a cash bonus of $4,117,500 on or before March 15, 2006.
As amended, the
agreement requires the Company to pay Mr. Buckleys reasonable expenses of
relocating his primary residence to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, consistent
with the Companys relocation policies applicable to other senior executives
(including the expenses of periodic travel between his residence in Illinois
and Minneapolis-St. Paul through June 30, 2007). If payment of these
relocation expenses results in taxable income to Mr. Buckley, the
agreement requires the Company to make additional payments to Mr. Buckley
(tax gross-ups) with which he may pay the taxes on such income. While he
remains employed by the Company, the agreement gives Mr. Buckley the right
to have the Company purchase one of his residences in Illinois or Minnesota at
its then prevailing value (to be determined by an appraiser mutually agreeable
to both parties) if he is unable to complete the sale of such residence within
120 days after electing to exercise this right.
The agreement provides
that Mr. Buckley will be eligible for the same perquisites that the
Company makes available to its other senior executives. Both Mr. Buckley
and his family will be entitled to use the aircraft owned by the Company for
business and personal purposes. The Company 
44 


will provide Mr. Buckley
with an automobile and driver for travel in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and
with an additional luxury automobile for which the Company will pay all
insurance, maintenance, gasoline, and other operating expenses. The Company
will provide appropriate security at Mr. Buckleys personal residences.
The agreement provides that Mr. Buckley will earn
a supplemental retirement benefit payable in the form of a lump-sum at the time
of his termination of employment. The amount of this benefit will be the
actuarially equivalent present value of the amount by which (a) a single
life annuity payable for Mr. Buckleys lifetime commencing at age 60 (or,
if later, on the date of his termination of employment) equal to 40 percent of
his highest average annual cash compensation (base salary plus bonus) during
any three consecutive years during his final ten years of employment, exceeds (b) the
sum of his actual pension benefits payable at age 60 (or, if later, on the date
of his termination of employment) under the plans of the Company and his
previous employers. The benefit formula for this supplemental retirement
benefit increases by 2 percent (from 40 percent) for each full year following Mr. Buckleys
60th birthday that he remains employed by the Company, up to a maximum of 50 percent.
This supplemental retirement benefit vests in full on December 6, 2010, upon
Mr. Buckleys death or termination due to disability, upon a termination
of his employment by the Company without Cause, or upon a termination of his
employment by Mr. Buckley for Good Reason. In the event of Mr. Buckleys
death or termination due to disability prior to his 60th birthday, the benefit
formula increases to 50 percent, the annuity amounts described in (a) and (b) above
are those commencing at age 65, and the entire benefit amount is multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is Mr. Buckleys years of service with
the Company through his date of death or termination and the denominator of
which is 6.
The agreement requires the
Company to pay Mr. Buckleys reasonable legal and other professional fees
incurred in connection with the completion of his employment agreement, up to a
maximum of $125,000, and pay him a tax gross-up payment with respect to its
payments of such fees.
Patrick D. Campbell
3M entered into an employment
agreement with Patrick D. Campbell at the time he was hired to serve as the
Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. While most of
this agreements terms expired on the third anniversary of his employment
commencement date (February 1, 2005), several of its provisions survived
and remain in effect today.
The agreement requires the
Company to provide Mr. Campbell supplemental retirement benefits. If he
remains employed by 3M for at least ten years, the supplemental benefits will
be payable in the form of an annuity payable for his lifetime commencing at age
60 and based on 45 percent of his highest average annual compensation over a
four-year period. If Mr. Campbell is employed by 3M for less than ten
years, the amount of these supplemental retirement benefits will be prorated
accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be reduced by the amount of his
benefits under 3Ms other pension plans and the pension plans of his prior
employer. Once he completed two years of employment with 3M, the agreement
provided that the sum of these supplemental retirement benefits and the
benefits payable under 3Ms pension plans would not be less than $100,000 per
year. These supplemental retirement benefits (other than the $100,000 minimum
benefit, which vested after two years of employment with the Company) vest
after five years of employment with the Company, although they vest immediately
in the event of the termination of his employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, or termination for good reason.
Richard F. Ziegler
3M has also entered
into an employment agreement with Richard F. Ziegler providing for his
employment as Senior Vice President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel of the
Company. While most 
45 


of this agreements terms expired on the third
anniversary of his employment commencement date (January 1, 2006), several
of its provisions survived and remain in effect today.
Pursuant to the agreement, the
Company granted Mr. Ziegler 12,000 shares of restricted stock effective as
of the agreements effective date (February 1, 2003). These shares vest in
increments of one-third on the 1st of
January in the years 2006, 2008, and 2010, assuming he remains employed by
the Company, although such vesting accelerates in the event of termination of Mr. Zieglers
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause,
termination for good reason, or a change in control of the Company.
The agreement also
requires 3M to provide Mr. Ziegler supplemental retirement benefits. If he
remains employed by the Company for at least nine years, the supplemental
benefits will be payable in the form of an annuity payable for his lifetime
commencing at age 62 and based on 45 percent of his highest average annual
compensation over a four-year period. If Mr. Ziegler is employed by the
Company for less than nine years, the amount of these supplemental retirement
benefits will be prorated accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be
reduced by the amount of his benefits under 3Ms other pension plans. Once he
completed two years of employment with 3M, the agreement provided that the sum
of these supplemental retirement benefits and the benefits payable under 3Ms
other pension plans would not be less than $300,000 per year. These
supplemental retirement benefits (other than the $300,000 minimum benefit,
which vested after two years of employment with the Company) vest after five
years of employment with the Company, although they vest immediately in the
event of the termination of his employment by reason of death or disability,
termination without cause, or termination for good reason.
On March 14, 2007,
the Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Ziegler describing
the terms of his retirement from the Company effective January 1, 2008
(the Letter Agreement), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to
the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 19,
2007. The terms of the Letter Agreement are consistent with previously
disclosed grants and awards and the provisions of his employment agreement and
of 3Ms benefit plans and programs. The Letter Agreement also includes other
customary provisions including a release of claims. Mr. Ziegler will cease
to serve as Senior Vice President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel effective
March 31, 2007, but will continue to be employed by 3M thereafter until
his retirement.

The Employee Retirement Income Plan (ERIP) is a
tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by 3M for its eligible employees
in the United States. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended the
ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees hired or
rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who
voluntarily elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice
election period in 2001. Of the Named Executive Officers, Dr. Nozari and Dr. Palensky
participate under the non-pension equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio I
Plan), while Mr. Buckley, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Ziegler participate
under the pension equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio II  Plan). Retirement benefits under the ERIP are
based on an employees years of service and average annual earnings during the
employees four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied to the
Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base salary,
profit sharing, and annual incentive compensation.
Under the Portfolio I Plan, employees earn annual
benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of their high-four
average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service plus 0.35 percent
of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security
breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum of 35 years). The
Social Security breakpoint is an average of the Social Security taxable wage
bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each employee qualifies for
receiving unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. Under the Portfolio I
Plan, an employee may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for
employees born after 1942) and if the employees age and service at the time of
retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942) the
employee would receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. Dr. Nozari
is entitled to retire with unreduced pension benefits payable under the
Portfolio I Plan. Dr. Palensky is entitled to retire with reduced early
retirement benefits under the Portfolio I Plan, with the reduction being equal
to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each year that he retires
prior to his age 61.
49 


Under the Portfolio II Plan, employees earn a total
pension value payable at retirement based on the number of credits earned during
each year of employment multiplied by their high-four average annual
earnings plus 50 percent of the number of such credits multiplied by their high-four
average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level. The
Social Security integration level is 70 percent of the Social Security taxable
wage base in effect for the year each employee retires or leaves 3M. Under the
Portfolio II Plan, an employee may retire any time after age 55 with at least five
years of service and their annual benefit payable is based on their total
pension value determined at the time of retirement converted to an actuarially
equivalent annuity. Mr. Campbell is entitled to retire with actuarially reduced
early retirement benefits under the Portfolio II Plan.
As a tax-qualified
plan, the ERIP is subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount
of any employees earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits
earned under the plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any
employee may earn. The Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide
additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers,
affected by these limits. The amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified
Pension Plan generally equal the amount of benefits an employee was not able to
earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by federal tax laws. The
benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan are generally paid at the
same time and in the same form as an employees benefits are paid under the
ERIP.
Mr. Buckley, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Ziegler
also earn supplemental retirement benefits pursuant to their employment
agreements with the Company. These supplemental benefits, which were negotiated
at the time they agreed to leave their previous employers and join 3M, are
designed to replace a portion of the pension benefits they failed to earn under
the plans of their previous employers because they ended their employment
before becoming eligible to retire. 
These supplemental benefits are described in detail in the section
titled Additional Information Regarding the Employment Agreements of the Named
Executive Officers following the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.
50 


NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED
COMPENSATION
The following table reflects
the participation during 2006 by the Named Executive Officers in two
nonqualified deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred
Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or
until retirement from the Company the receipt of base salary, profit sharing, annual
incentive compensation, and Performance Unit Plan award payouts. The VIP Plus
Plan allows eligible employees to defer until retirement from the Company the
receipt of base salary, profit sharing, and annual incentive compensation. Earnings
are credited to the amounts deferred under both plans based on the returns paid
on the investment funds available to participants in 3Ms qualified 401(k) plan
or a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each
participant).

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON
TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The Company has entered into
employment agreements with three of the Named Executive Officers that will require
it to make payments to these individuals in the event of the termination of
their employment or change in control of the Company. In addition, many of the
Companys executive compensation, benefit, and deferred compensation plans
provide the Named Executive Officers with certain rights or the right to
receive payments in the event of the termination of their employment or upon a
change in control of the Company. The amounts payable to each of the Named
Executive Officers in each situation is described below, assuming that each
individuals employment had terminated or a change in control of the Company
had occurred on December 29, 2006.
Generally Available Compensation and Benefit Plans
Each of 3Ms Named Executive Officers is eligible to
participate in and receive compensation or benefits under several plans of the
Company that provide for certain payments or rights in the event of the death
of the individual or a change in control of the Company. Both of the Companys
deferred compensation programs, the Deferred Compensation Plan and the VIP Plus
Plan, provide that the plans will terminate and pay out the account balances of
all participants immediately following a change in control of the Company. The
Performance Unit Plan provides that the plan will terminate and the Company
will immediately pay out the pro rata value of all outstanding performance
units immediately following a change in control of the Company (based on the
higher of the value of the units for the most recently completed performance period
or the value of the outstanding units as if the performance of the Company
during the remainder of each respective performance period equaled its
performance to the date of the change in control). Upon the death of a
participating executive, the Performance Unit Plan provides that all
outstanding performance units granted to such executive will be paid out to the
executives beneficiaries or estate (based on the actual performance of the
Company for any performance period completed prior to the death of the
executive and at the par value of such units for any performance period that
has not been completed by the date of death of an executive). The Nonqualified
Pension Plan provides that, in the event of a change in control of the Company,
the plan will terminate and pay out the remaining accrued benefits of all
participants in either an immediate lump-sum cash payment or through the
purchase of annuity contracts designed to pay the pension benefits that would
otherwise have been paid following the retirement of each participant. The
Management Stock Ownership Program provides that all outstanding stock options,
restricted stock, and restricted stock units will immediately vest in full upon
the death of the participant or a change in control of the Company. The
Management Stock Ownership Program also provides that the outstanding stock
options of an individual who retires from employment with the Company do not
expire but may continue to be exercised (after they have vested) after the
retirement of the individual for the remainder of the term of each option. The
Management Stock Ownership Program also provides that the outstanding stock
options of an individual who dies will immediately vest and may be exercised
for up to two years following the death of such individual (but not beyond the
original expiration date of an option). With the exception of the Management
Stock Ownership Program, these plans define a change in control of the Company
as the ownership by one person of at least 30 percent of the voting securities
of the Company or the replacement of at least 50 percent of the members of the
Companys Board of Directors. The Management Stock Ownership Program defines a
change in control of the Company as the ownership by one person of at least 20
percent of the voting securities of the Company or the replacement of at least
50 percent of the members of the Companys Board of Directors.
The amounts shown below for each of the Named
Executive Officers do not include payments and benefits generally provided on a
non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated salaried employees of the
Company upon the termination of their employment with the Company, including:
(a) accrued salary, profit sharing, and unused vacation benefits,
(b) accrued pension benefits under 
52 


the Employee Retirement Income Plan and the
Nonqualified Pension Plan, (c) retiree welfare benefits provided to
substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees, including retiree medical
and dental benefits, (d) distributions of account balances under the
Companys qualified 401(k) plan, and (e) vesting of stock options
granted under the Management Stock Ownership Program upon the death of an
individual or a change in control of the Company, and the continued
exercisability of stock options granted under such Program following the death
or retirement of an individual.
George W. Buckley
Mr.  Buckleys employment agreement with the Company provides that in
the event the Company terminates his employment without Cause or if he
terminates his employment with Good Reason, he would receive: (a) cash
severance equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and target
annual bonus payable in the form of 24 equal monthly installments (or in the
form of an immediate lump-sum if the termination follows a Change of Control of
the Company), (b) a pro rata portion of the annual bonus that he would
otherwise have earned for the year in which his employment so terminates,
(c) if a Change of Control of the Company causes any payment upon his termination
of employment to be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code, a tax gross-up payment with which to pay such tax and
the additional taxes payable as a result of such payment, and
(d) immediate vesting of the stock options, restricted stock units,
performance units, and supplemental retirement benefits provided under the
agreement, and continued welfare benefits for the period that cash severance
benefits are payable. No severance benefits (other than accrued salary, bonus,
and benefits) are payable in the event of the termination of Mr. Buckleys
employment by the Company for Cause or by Mr. Buckley without Good Reason.
In the event of the termination of Mr. Buckleys employment due to his
death or disability, no severance benefits are payable (other than accrued
salary, bonus, and benefits, including the supplemental retirement benefits
provided under the agreement) other than a pro rata portion of the annual bonus
he would otherwise have earned for the year in which his employment so
terminates. If any payment or other benefit provided to Mr. Buckley
pursuant to his employment agreement would be subject to the excise tax imposed
by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, Mr. Buckley would be
entitled to receive a tax gross-up payment with which to pay such tax and the
additional taxes payable as a result of such payment. As a condition to
receiving any cash severance, pro rata annual bonus or supplemental retirement
benefits, Mr. Buckley will sign and deliver to the Company a standard
release of claims. In his employment agreement with the Company and as
confirmed in the release of claims, Mr. Buckley agrees that for a period
of two years following the termination of his employment he will: (1) 
neither employ nor seek to employ any employee of the Company or encourage them
to leave the Company, and (2) neither acquire an ownership interest in or
perform certain services for a competitor of the Company.
For purposes of
Mr. Buckleys employment agreement, Cause means any of the following:
(i) his commission of a felony or misdemeanor involving fraud, dishonesty,
or moral turpitude, (ii) his material breach of such employment agreement,
(iii) willful or intentional material misconduct by Mr. Buckley in
the performance of his duties, (iv) willful and intentional failure by
Mr. Buckley to materially comply with a specific, written direction of the
Board of Directors that is consistent with normal business practice and not
inconsistent with his responsibilities under such employment agreement,
(v) a material violation of the Companys conflict of interest policy,
(vi) a material violation of any Company policy that would be grounds for
the immediate dismissal of any senior executive of the Company, or
(vii) an order or determination of any court, administrative agency, or
other entity that has the effect of prohibiting Mr. Buckley from
performing his responsibilities under such employment agreement. For purposes
of Mr. Buckleys employment agreement, Good Reason means any of the following
(unless he agrees in writing that a specific event shall not be Good Reason):
(i) the Companys material breach of his employment agreement,
(ii) the Companys failure to assign his employment agreement to a
successor of the Company or such successors failure to explicitly 
53 


assume and agree to be bound by such agreement,
(iii) a requirement that Mr. Buckley be principally based at any
office or location more than 30 miles from the Companys current headquarters
in St. Paul, Minnesota, or (iv) upon or following a Change of Control of
the Company, the failure to nominate and elect Mr. Buckley to serve as the
chief executive officer, chairman of the board, or most senior executive
officer of the Company or its top-tier parent entity. For purposes of Mr. Buckleys
employment agreement, a Change of Control of the Company means any of the
following (unless he agrees in writing that a specific event shall not be
considered a Change of Control): (i) any person becomes the owner of 20
percent or more of the voting securities of the Company, (ii) the members
of the Board of Directors of the Company as of December 6, 2005, and their
approved successors fail to constitute at least 50 percent of the members of
such Board of Directors, (iii) a merger, consolidation, or reorganization
involving the Company if the beneficial owners of the Companys voting
securities immediately before such transaction are not expected to own more
than 50 percent of the voting power of such voting securities in the
corporation resulting from such transaction, (iv) a plan or agreement for
the sale or other disposition of substantially all of the assets of the Company
(other than to an entity more than 50 percent owned by the Company or an entity
more than 50 percent owned by the beneficial owners of the voting securities of
the Company immediately before the sale or other disposition), or
(v) approval of a plan of liquidation by the stockholders of the Company.
If Mr. Buckleys
employment with the Company had ended as of December 29, 2006, due to
either a termination without Cause by the Company or a termination with Good
Reason by Mr. Buckley, he would have received the following amounts: (a) cash
severance in the amount of $8,400,000 payable in 24 equal monthly
installments,  (b) two years of
continued coverage under the Companys medical, dental, disability, life
insurance, and other welfare benefit plans applicable to the other senior
executives of the Company, with an estimated value of approximately $28,430
(based on current premium rates for COBRA continuation coverage and the
assumption that these rates will increase approximately 6 percent per year), (c) 197,808
shares of common stock of the Company with a fair market value equal to
$15,415,177 (based on a closing stock price of $77.93 per share on
December 29, 2006), as the result of the vesting of his outstanding
restricted stock units, (d) immediate vesting of 200,000 of the stock
options that he received at the time his employment with the Company commenced,
and the opportunity to exercise such options for a period of up to two years
following the termination date, with an estimated value of $0 since the
exercise price of these options ($78.15) exceeded the closing 3M stock price of
$77.93 on December 29, 2006, (e) a cash payment of $1,987,871 in
satisfaction of his outstanding performance units under the Performance Unit
Plan, and (f) a cash payment of $12,282,823 as the lump-sum actuarial
equivalent present value of his accrued supplemental retirement benefits under
his employment agreement, as the result of the vesting of such supplemental
retirement benefits.
If Mr. Buckleys
employment with the Company had ended as of December 29, 2006 due to his
death or disability, he or his beneficiaries would have received the following
amounts: (a) 197,808 shares of common stock of the Company with a fair
market value equal to $15,415,177 (based on a closing stock price of $77.93 per
share on December 29, 2006), as the result of the vesting of his
outstanding restricted stock units, (b) immediate vesting of 200,000 of
the stock options that he received at the time his employment with the Company
commenced, and the opportunity to exercise such options for a period of up to two
years following the termination date, with an estimated value of $0 since the
exercise price of these options ($78.15) exceeded the closing 3M stock price of
$77.93 on December 29, 2006, (c) a cash payment of $1,987,871 in
satisfaction of his outstanding performance units under the Performance Unit
Plan, (d) in the event of his death, life insurance proceeds in the amount
of $11,600,000 under the policies issued to him under the Executive Life
Insurance Plan, and (e) a cash payment of $1,955,000 as the lump-sum
actuarial equivalent present value of his accrued supplemental retirement
benefits under his employment agreement, as the result of the vesting of such
supplemental retirement benefits.
54 


If as of December 29, 2006, there had been a
Change of Control of the Company, Mr. Buckley would have received the
following amounts: (a) 197,808 shares of common stock of the Company with
a fair market value equal to $15,415,177 (based on a closing stock price of
$77.93 per share on December 29, 2006), as the result of the vesting of
his outstanding restricted stock units, and (b) a cash payment of
$1,987,871 in satisfaction of his outstanding performance units under the
Performance Unit Plan.
Patrick D. Campbell
Mr.  Campbells employment agreement with the Company provides that in
the event the Company terminates his employment without Cause or if he
terminates his employment with Good Reason, he would receive: (a) cash
severance equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and annual
planned profit sharing if such termination occurs within the first five years
following his employment commencement date and one times the sum of his annual
base salary and annual planned profit sharing if such termination occurs more
than five years but no more than ten years following his employment
commencement date, (b) a period of two years following the termination
date in which to exercise the stock options granted to him at the time his
employment commenced and the stock options he received as his annual stock
option grant for 2002, and (c) immediate vesting of the supplemental
retirement benefits provided under the agreement. No severance benefits (other
than accrued salary, profit sharing, and benefits) are payable in the event of
the termination of Mr. Campbells employment by the Company for Cause or
by Mr. Campbell without Good Reason. In the event of the termination of

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The role of the Audit
Committee includes assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of the
Companys financial reporting process. In performing this oversight function,
the Audit Committee has:
·       Reviewed
and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management,
which has primary responsibility for the financial statements;
·       Discussed
with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), the Companys independent registered
public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by the statement
on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit
Committees, as currently in effect;
·       Received
the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by Independence
Standards Board Standard No.1, Independence Discussions
with Audit Committees, as currently in effect, and discussed the
independence of PwC with them; and
·       Reviewed
the services provided by PwC, other than their audit services, and concluded
that the PwCs provision of such other services is compatible with PwCs
independence.
Based upon the review and discussions described above,
the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited
consolidated financial statements be included in the Companys Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, for filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Audit Committee Policy on
Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing and
overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (Independent
Accounting Firm). The Audit Committee has established the following procedures
for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided
by the Independent Accounting Firm.
Before
engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm for the next years audit, the Independent Accounting Firm will submit a detailed description
of services it expects to render to the Company during that year for each of
the following categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval:
1.    Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation of
consolidated financial statements, as well as work that generally only the
Independent Accounting Firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including
comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services and consultation
regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards.
2.    Audit related services are for assurance and related services
that are traditionally performed by the Independent Accounting Firm, including
due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan
audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory
requirements.
3.    Tax services include all services performed by the Independent
Accounting Firms tax personnel except those services specifically related to
the audit of the financial statements, and includes fees in the areas of tax
compliance, tax planning, and tax advice.
59 


4.    Other services are those services not captured in the other
categories.
Before engagement, the Audit
Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are
budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the Independent Accounting Firm to report
actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of
service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary
to engage the Independent Accounting
Firm for additional services not contemplated in the original
pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific
pre-approval before engaging the Independent
Accounting Firm.
The Audit Committee has
delegated pre-approval authority to the chair of the Committee. The chair must
report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the
Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The following table presents
fees for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the
audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2006, and fees billed for other services rendered by

APPENDIX
A
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
GUIDELINES
Determination of
Independence
A director is independent if the Board affirmatively
determines that the director has no material relationship with 3M (including
its consolidated subsidiaries) directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer
of an organization that has a relationship with 3M. The Board has established
the following guidelines to assist it in determining director independence
(including nominees for director), that conform to or are more exacting than
the independence requirements in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards
(NYSE Rules). In addition to applying these guidelines, the Board will consider
all relevant facts and circumstances in making an independence determination
not only from the standpoint of the director, but also from that of persons or
organizations with which the director has an affiliation.
1.                In no event will a
director be considered independent if:
a.               Employment Relationship  A director
is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of 3M, or whose
immediate family member(1), is or has been within the last three years, an
executive officer of 3M;
b.              Payments >$100,000  A director
who received, or whose immediate family member received, more than $100,000 per
year in direct compensation from 3M (other than director fees) within the last
three years;
c.               Auditor Relationships  (i) A
director, or whose immediate family member, is a current partner of 3Ms
internal or external auditor; (ii) a director is a current employee of
such a firm; (iii) a director has an immediate family member who is a
current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firms audit,
assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (iv) a
director, or whose immediate family member, was within the last three years
(but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a firm who personally worked
on 3Ms audit within that time;
d.              Compensation Committee Interlock  A
3M executive officer is on the compensation committee of the board of directors
of a company which employs the 3M director or an immediate family member as an
executive officer;
e.               Commercial Relationships  A director
is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive
officer, of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, 3M
for property or services in an amount which, in of the last three years,
exceeds the greater of $1 million, or two percent of the directors companys
consolidated gross revenues.
2.                Audit Committee
members may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from
3M, other than directors fees.

(1) New York Stock Exchange Rule 303A(2)(b) defines immediate
family to include a persons spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers- and
fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than employees) who share such persons
home.
A-1 


3.                The
following commercial relationships will not be considered to be material
relationships that would impair a directors independence:
a.               If
a 3M director is an executive officer or employee, or if an immediate family
member is an executive officer, of another company that does business with 3M
and the sales by that company to 3M or purchases by that company from 3M, in
any single year within the last three years, are less than or equal to one
percent of the annual consolidated gross revenues of that company; or
b.              If a 3M director is
an executive officer or employee, or if an immediate family member is an
executive officer, of another company which is indebted to 3M, or to which 3M
is indebted, and the total amount of either companys indebtedness to the
other, in any single year within the last three years, is less than or equal to
one percent of the other companys total consolidated assets.
4.                Charitable
relationships will not be considered to be material relationships that would
impair a directors independence if a 3M director or immediate family member
serves as an officer, director, or trustee of a charitable organization, and 3Ms
discretionary charitable contributions to the organization are less than or
equal to one percent of that organizations consolidated annual gross revenues.
5.                The Board will
annually make and publicly disclose its independence determination for each
director. The Board may determine that a director who has a relationship that
exceeds the limits described in paragraphs 3 (provided that such a relationship
would not constitute a bar to independence under the NYSE Rules) or 4 is
nonetheless independent. The Company will explain in the next proxy statement
the basis for any Board determination that a relationship is immaterial despite
the fact that it does not meet the categorical independence guidelines. For
example, if a director is the CEO of a company that purchases products and
services from 3M that are more than one percent of that companys annual
revenues, the independent directors could determine, after considering all of
the relevant circumstances, that such a relationship was immaterial, and that
the director would be considered independent under the NYSE Rules.
6.                The Company will
not make any personal loans or extensions of credit to directors.
7.                All directors are
required to deal at arms length with 3M and its subsidiaries and to disclose
circumstances material to the director that might be perceived as a conflict of
interest.

APPENDIX
B
3M CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
GUIDELINES
(As
amended February 12, 2007)
The Board of Directors (the Board)
of 3M Company (3M or the Company) has adopted these guidelines, which in
conjunction with the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Board Committee
charters, form the framework for governance of the Company.
A.   THE
ROLES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT
         1.       The Board of
Directors  The business of the Company is conducted under the
oversight of the Board of Directors. The Board selects the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and delegates to the CEO the authority and responsibility to
manage the Companys operations. The Board of Directors serves as elected
representatives of the shareholders, acts as an advisor and counselor to the
CEO and senior management, and oversees management performance on behalf of
shareholders. The Board also oversees the Companys strategic and business
planning process and reviews and assesses managements approach to addressing
significant risks facing the Company.
         2.       Management 
The CEO and senior management are responsible for running the Companys
business operations.
B.   BOARD
COMPOSITION AND LEADERSHIP
         1.       Chairman of
the Board and Chief Executive Officer  The Board has the
authority to decide whether the positions of Chairman and CEO should be held by
the same person and shall determine the best arrangement for the Company and
its shareholders in light of all relevant and changing circumstances. The Board
currently believes that the same individual should hold the position of
Chairman and CEO (Chairman/CEO).
         2.       Size of the
Board  The number of directors should not exceed a number that
can function efficiently. The Nominating and Governance Committee considers and
makes recommendations to the Board concerning the appropriate size and needs of
the Board.
         3.       Board Independence 
The Board believes in having a substantial majority of independent directors
on the 3M Board. A director is independent if the Board affirmatively
determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company
directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a
relationship with the Company and otherwise meets the requirements for
independence of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The
independent directors will make the Board decisions on corporate governance
matters.
         4.       Board
Membership Criteria  The Nominating and Governance Committee
periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics
required of Board members given the current Board composition. It is the intent
of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a high performance organization
creating competitive advantage for the Company. To perform as such, the Board
will be comprised of individuals who have distinguished records of leadership
and success in their arena of activity and who will make substantial
contributions to Board operations and effectively represent the interests of
all stockholders. The Boards assessment of Board candidates includes, but is
not limited to, consideration of: (i) roles and contributions valuable to
the business community, (ii) personal qualities of leadership, character,
judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout service
on the Board a reputation in the community at large of integrity, trust, respect,
competence, and adherence to the highest ethical standards, (iii) relevant
knowledge and diversity of background and experience in such things as
business, manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing,
international business, 
B-1 


government, and the
like; or (iv) whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time
required for preparation, participation, and attendance at all meetings. A
directors qualifications in light of these criteria is considered at least
each time the director is re-nominated for Board membership.
         5.       Selection of
New Director Candidates  The Nominating and Governance
Committee considers qualified director candidates from several sources,
including stockholders, and evaluates candidates against the current board
membership criteria described above. In addition to these minimum requirements,
the Committee will also evaluate whether the candidates skills are
complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for
particular expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing, technology,
financial, marketing, international, governmental, or other areas of expertise,
and assess the candidates impact on Board dynamics and effectiveness. The
Committee selects candidates that best suit the Boards current needs and
recommends one or more of such individuals to the Board. Exacting membership
criteria and a rigorous selection process help ensure that candidates
recommended to the Board will effectively represent the balanced best interests
of all stockholders.
         6.       Voting for Directors  Any
nominee for director in an uncontested election (i.e., an election where the
only nominees are those recommended by the Board) who receives a greater number
of votes withheld from his or her election than votes for such election (a Majority
Withheld Vote) will promptly tender his or her resignation for consideration
by the Nominating and Governance Committee.
a.               The Nominating and
Governance Committee will promptly consider the best interests of 3M and its stockholders
and recommend to a committee of independent directors of the Board whether to
accept the tendered resignation or to take some other action, such as rejecting
the resignation and addressing the apparent underlying causes of the withheld
votes.
b.              The Board will
create a committee of all the independent directors who did not receive a
Majority Withheld Vote to consider the Nominating and Governance Committees
recommendation and take action within 90 days following the uncontested
election. Thereafter, the committee of independent directors will promptly
disclose its decision and an explanation of how the decision was reached in a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
c.               Except as provided
below, a director receiving a Majority Withheld Vote shall remain active and
engaged in Board activities during this Nominating and Governance Committee and
Board process.
d.              If one or more
members of the Nominating and Governance Committee receive a Majority Withheld
Vote, then the Board will create a committee of independent directors who did
not receive a Majority Withheld Vote to consider the resignation offers of all
directors receiving a Majority Withheld Vote and determine whether to accept
the tendered resignation(s) or to take some other action and promptly
disclose their decision as described in paragraph 6b above.
e.               Any director who
receives a Majority Withheld Vote and tenders his or her resignation pursuant
to this provision will not participate in the committee action regarding
whether to accept the tendered resignation offer or take some other action.
However, if the only directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote in
the same election constitute three or fewer independent directors, then all
independent directors may participate in the committee action regarding whether
to accept the resignation offer(s) or to take some other action.
B-2 


f.                   This corporate
governance guideline will be summarized in each proxy statement relating to an
election of directors of 3M.
         7.       Director
Orientation and Continuing Education  The Company provides
directors with an orientation and education program to familiarize them with
the Companys business operations and plans, industry trends and corporate
governance practices, as well as ongoing education on issues facing the Company
and on subjects that would assist the directors in discharging their duties.
         8.       Directors
Who Experience Change in Present Job Responsibilities or Other Relevant
Circumstances  When a directors principal occupation or
business affiliation changes, or other circumstances arise which may raise
questions about the directors continuing qualifications in relation to the
Board Membership Criteria set forth above, then the director will tender
her/his resignation, or the Nominating and Governance Committee will ask for
such tender. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the tendered
resignation and recommend to the Board the action to be taken.
         9.       Service On
Other For-Profit Boards  Independent directors are encouraged
to evaluate carefully the time required to serve on other boards (excluding
non-profit) taking into account board attendance, preparation, participation,
and effectiveness on these boards. Independent directors must advise the
Chairman/CEO before accepting an invitation to serve on another board to enable
the Company to determine whether (i) any regulatory issues or potential
conflicts are raised by the director accepting such an invitation and (ii) the
director will have the time required for preparation, participation, and
attendance at 3M Board meetings. Independent directors who also serve as CEOs
of publicly traded companies should not serve on more than two boards of public
companies in addition to the 3M Board, and other independent directors should
not serve on more than five other boards of public companies in addition to the
3M Board.
10.         Retirement
Policy  Each nonemployee director must tender her/his
resignation at the annual meeting following her or his 72nd birthday. If circumstances dictate, the
Nominating and Governance Committee may ask a director to continue to serve on
the Board past age 72.
11.         Board
Compensation Review  The Nominating and Governance Committee
will periodically receive reports on the status of Board compensation in
relation to other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending to
the Board changes in compensation for nonemployee directors.
12.         Boards Interaction with Stakeholders  The
Chairman/CEO is responsible for establishing effective communications with the
Companys stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees,
communities, suppliers, creditors, governments, and corporate partners. It is
the policy of the Board that management speaks for the Company. This policy
does not preclude independent directors from meeting with stakeholders, but
management where appropriate should be present at such meetings.
C.   BOARD
OPERATIONS
         1.       Selection of
Agenda Items for Board Meetings  At the first Board meeting of
each year, the Chairman/CEO, in consultation with the lead director, will
propose for the Boards approval agenda items to be discussed during the course
of the year. Before each meeting, the Chairman/CEO will review proposed agenda
items with the lead director and distribute the agenda in advance to the Board.
Any Board member may ask to include items on the agenda.
         2.       Board
Materials Distributed in Advance  Board members receive
materials related to agenda items sufficiently in advance of Board meetings so
that the directors may prepare to discuss the 
B-3 


items at the meeting.
Sensitive subjects may be discussed at the meeting without distributing written
materials in advance or at the meeting.
         3.       Director Responsibilities 
Directors must exercise their business judgment to act in the best interests of
the shareholders and the Company. In discharging this obligation, directors
reasonably may rely on the Companys senior executives and its advisors and
auditors. Directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
and attend and participate in all meetings of the Board and of committees on
which they serve and to spend the time needed and prepare for and meet as
frequently as necessary to discharge their responsibilities.
         4.       Board
Presentations and Access to Employees  Members of senior
management may be invited to attend part or all of a Board meeting in order to
participate in discussions. Generally, the executive responsible for an area of
the Companys operations the Board is to consider makes the presentation. Board
members have complete access to all other members of management and Company
employees.
         5.       Board Access
to Independent Advisors  The Board and its committees may seek
advice from outside advisors as appropriate. The Board shall have sole
authority to approve related fees and retention terms.
         6.       Executive Sessions  As
an agenda item for every regularly scheduled board meeting, independent
directors have the opportunity to meet in executive sessions, without the
Chairman/CEO or other members of management present, to consider such matters
as they deem appropriate.
         7.       Lead
Independent Director  The Board has selected an independent
director to serve as lead director. The lead director will be elected
periodically by a majority of the independent directors upon recommendation
from the Nominating and Governance Committee. The lead director will:
a.               preside at all
meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive
sessions of the independent directors;
b.              act as a key liaison
between the Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;
c.               will assist the
Chairman/CEO in setting the Board agenda and frequency of meetings;
d.              has the authority to
call meetings of the independent directors;
e.               will communicate
Board member feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the
Compensation Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEOs performance
and communicates the Boards evaluation of that performance to the
Chairman/CEO); and
f.                   perform such
other duties as requested by the Board.
The name of, and a means of contacting, the lead
director will be made public in the Companys proxy statement for the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders.
D.   BOARD
COMMITTEES
         1.       Committees 
The current committees are Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and
Governance.
         2.       Assignment
and Term of Service of Committee Members  The Board is
responsible for the appointment of committee members and chairs, based on
recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
         3.       Agenda, Frequency, Length,
and Reports of Committee Meetings  The chair of each committee
approves the agenda, length of, and attendance at each committee meeting and
determines the frequency of meetings. Materials related to agenda items are
given to the committee members 
B-4 


sufficiently in advance
to allow the members to prepare for discussing the items at the meeting. The
committee chairs report a summary of their meeting to the Board following each
regular committee meeting.
         4.       Membership 
Only independent directors may serve on the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and
Nominating and Governance Committees.
         5.       Responsibilities 
The Board periodically reviews the responsibilities of each
committee and approves the committee charters, copies of which are attached to
these guidelines.
E.   BOARD
AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION
         1.       Formal Evaluation of the
Chairman/CEO  The Compensation Committee, in consultation with
the Chairman/CEO, sets annual and long-term performance goals for the
Chairman/CEO. The chair of the Compensation Committee leads the discussion of
the Chairman/CEOs performance against such goals with the independent
directors and communicates the Boards evaluation to the Chairman/CEO. The
Compensation Committee will use the evaluation when determining the
compensation of the Chairman/CEO.
         2.       Board
Self-Assessment  The Board will conduct an annual
self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning
effectively. The Nominating and Governance Committee will receive comments from
all directors and share those comments with the Board. Based on the comments
and further discussion, the Board will make an assessment specifically
reviewing areas in which the Board and/or the management believe improvements
could be made to increase the effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
         3.       Succession Planning 
The Board plans the succession to the position of Chairman/CEO and certain
other senior management positions. To assist the Board, the Chairman/CEO
annually assesses senior managers and their succession potential. The
Chairman/CEO also provides the Board with an assessment of persons considered
potential successors to certain senior management positions.
         4.       Management
Development  The Chairman/CEO annually should report to the
Board on the Companys program for management development.
Policy on Adoption of a
Rights Plan
In 2002 and 2003, a 3M stockholder submitted a shareholder proposal to
3M regarding the approval process for adopting a stockholders rights plan
(also known as a poison pill). 3M does not have a rights plan and is not
currently considering adopting one. The Board continues to believe, however,
that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a rights plan would be
necessary to give the Board the negotiating power and leverage to obtain the
best result for 3M stockholders in the context of a takeover effort.
Following consideration of the favorable vote the stockholder proposal
received and in light of this belief, the Board has adopted and reaffirmed a
statement of policy on this topic. The Boards policy is that it will only
adopt a rights plan if either (1) stockholders have approved adoption of
the rights plan or (2) the Board in its exercise of its fiduciary
responsibilities, including a majority of the independent members of the Board,
makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at the time, it is
in the best interests of 3Ms stockholders to adopt a rights plan without the
delay in adoption that would come from the time reasonably anticipated to seek
stockholder approval.
The Board has directed the Nominating and Governance Committee to
review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to the Board on
any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The terms of the policy,
as in effect, will be included in 3Ms published Corporate Governance
Guidelines and its proxy statement.

TENTH:   A.   The
number of directors of the Corporation shall be fixed from time to time by or

Stockholders of the Corporation, the directors shall be divided, with respect

nearly equal in number of directors as possible, as determined by the Board of
Directors, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 1987, the term of office of the second
class to expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 1988, and
the term of office of the third class to expire at the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders to be held in 1989, with each class of directors to hold office
until their successors are duly elected and have qualified. At each Annual
Meeting of Stockholders following such initial classification and election
until the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, directors elected to succeed
those directors whose terms expire at such annual meeting, other than those
directors elected under particular circumstances by a separate class vote of
the holders of any class or series of stock having a preference over the common
stock, of a par value of $0.01 per share, of the Corporation (the Common Stock)
as to dividends or upon liquidation of the Corporation, shall be elected to
hold office for a term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the
third year following the year of their election and until their successors are
duly elected and have qualified. When the number of directors is changed, any
newly created directorships or any decrease in directorships shall be so
apportioned among the classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number
of directors as possible, as determined by the Board of Directors. The terms of
office of all directors who are in office immediately prior to the closing of
the polls for the election of directors at the 2007 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders of the Corporation shall expire at such time. At each Annual
Meeting of Stockholders beginning with the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
of the Corporation, the directors shall not be classified, and the directors
shall be elected annually and shall hold office for a term expiring at the next
Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors shall have
been duly elected and qualified. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board 
G1-3 


of
Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. The provisions of
this Paragraph are subject to the provisions of Paragraph D of this Article.
B.   Except as
may be provided in the terms of any class or series of stock having a
preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation of the
Corporation relating to the rights of the holders of such class or series to
elect, by separate class vote, additional directors, prior to the 2007 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders of the Corporation, no member of the Board of Directors
may be removed from office except for cause. Except as may be provided in the
terms of any class or series of stock having a preference over the Common Stock
as to dividends or upon liquidation of the Corporation relating to the rights
of the holders of such class or series to elect, by separate class vote,
additional directors, from and after the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of
the Corporation, any member of the Board of Directors may be removed from
office with or without cause.
C.   Subject to
the provisions of Paragraph D of this Article TENTH, newly created
directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors of the
Corporation and vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors resulting from
death, resignation, retirement, removal, or any other reason shall be filled by
the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, although less than a
quorum, then remaining in office and elected by the holders of the capital
stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors or, in the event that there is only one such director, by such sole
remaining director. Prior to the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the
Corporation, any director elected in accordance with the preceding sentence
shall hold office for the full term of the class of directors in which the new
directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such directors
successor shall have been elected and qualified.
D.   In the event
that the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation having a
preference over the Common Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation of the
Corporation are entitled, by a separate class vote, to elect directors pursuant
to the terms of such class or series, then the provisions of such class or
series with respect to such rights of election shall apply to the election of
such directors. The number of directors that may be elected by the holders of
any such class or series of stock shall be in addition to the number fixed by
or pursuant to the Bylaws. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the terms
of such class or series, the number of directors that may be so elected by the
holders of any such class or series of stock shall be elected for terms
expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and without regard to any
classification of the remaining members of the Board of Directors, and
vacancies among directors so elected by the separate class vote of any such
class or series of stock shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the remaining directors elected by such class or series, or, if there are no
such remaining directors, by the holders of such class or series in the same
manner in which such class or series initially elected a director.
If at any meeting for the election of directors, more
than one class of stock, voting separately as classes, shall be entitled to
elect one or more directors and there shall be a quorum of only one such class
of stock, that class of stock shall be entitled to elect its quota of directors
notwithstanding absence of a quorum of the other class or classes of stock.
ELEVENTH: Subject to any limitations imposed by this
Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors shall have power to adopt,
amend, or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation. 
Any Bylaws made by the directors under the powers conferred hereby may
be amended or repealed by the directors or by the stockholders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or
the Bylaws of this Corporation (and notwithstanding that a lesser percentage
may be specified by law), no provisions of the Bylaws shall be adopted,
amended, or repealed by the stockholders without an affirmative vote of the
holders of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, considered for the purposes of this

eighty percent (80%) of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, considered for purposes of this Article as a single class.

for the approval or authorization of any Business Transaction with a Related

APPENDIX
H
3M EXECUTIVE ANNUAL
INCENTIVE PLAN
1.                Purposes.
The purposes of the 3M
Executive Annual Incentive Plan (the Plan) are to attract and retain highly
qualified individuals as executive officers of 3M; to focus their attention on
achieving certain business objectives established for 3M and its business
units; and to provide these individuals with incentive compensation that is
intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code.
2.                Definitions.
(a)           Adjusted
Net Income means the net income of 3M as reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Income as adjusted to exclude special items.
(b)          Committee
means those members of the Compensation Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors
who qualify as outside directors for purposes of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code.
(c)           Named
Executive Officers means those executive officers of 3M covered by the SECs
disclosure requirements for executive compensation in Item 402 of Regulation
S-K.
(d)          Participant
means an employee of 3M who is eligible to participate in this Plan pursuant to
Section 4 and whose participation in the Plan has been approved by the
Committee.
(e)           Plan
means this 3M Executive Annual Incentive Plan.
(f)               Plan
Year means the 12-month period ending on December 31.
(g)          Retirement means the
termination of a Participants employment with 3M after meeting the
requirements for retirement under any retirement plan of 3M (including, in the
United States, the 3M Employee Retirement Income Plan).
3.                Term
and Termination of the Plan.
This Plan shall become
effective on January 1, 2007, subject to approval by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding common stock of 3M voting
at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and it shall remain in effect until
it is terminated by the Committee.
4.                Participation.
The individuals eligible to
participate in this Plan shall be the Named Executive Officers of 3M, as well
as any other senior executives of 3M whose compensation is approved by the
Committee.
5.                Amounts
of Annual Incentive.
The maximum annual incentive
payable to any Named Executive Officer for any Plan Year shall be one-quarter
of one percent (0.25%) of the Adjusted Net Income for such Plan Year, while the
maximum annual incentive payable for any Plan Year to any Participant who is
not a Named Executive Officer shall be one-tenth of one percent (0.10%) of the
Adjusted Net Income for such Plan Year. Subject to these maximums, the
Committee shall determine the amount of each Participants annual incentive
opportunity for each Plan Year in its discretion. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Plan document, the Committee in its sole discretion may
decide to 
H-1 


reduce the annual incentive
payable to a Participant for any Plan Year below the applicable maximum amount
payable under this Section 5.
6.                Payments
of Annual Incentive.
All annual incentive payments
under this Plan shall be made in the form of cash or in the form of shares of
3M stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units delivered pursuant to the
3M Management Stock Ownership Program. All annual incentive payments for a Plan
Year shall be completed no later than March 15 of the year following the
end of such Plan Year; provided, however, that no payment shall be made under
this Plan until the Committee has certified in writing that: (a) the
performance goal for such Plan Year has been satisfied, and (b) the
limitations described in Section 5 have not been exceeded.
7.                Plan
Administration.
This Plan will be administered by the Committee, which
may delegate any of its administrative responsibilities in connection with the
Plan to the appropriate employees of 3M. The Committee will have full power and
authority to interpret the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules,
forms or procedures as it deems necessary for the proper administration of the
Plan, to determine the manner and time of payment of the annual incentive
compensation payable hereunder, and to take any other action as it deems
necessary or advisable in connection with the Plan. Any decision made, action
taken or interpretation made by the Committee or its delegate that is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan will be final, conclusive, and
binding on all persons interested in the Plan.
8.                Amendments.
The Committee may at any time
amend this Plan, in whole or in part; provided no amendment which would (a) increase
the maximum annual incentive payable to any Participant, or (b) revise the
performance goal available for determining the amount of the annual incentive
compensation payable hereunder, shall become effective until approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding
common stock of 3M voting at a meeting of the corporations stockholders.
9.                Rights
of Participants.
Nothing in this Plan or the
fact that a person has received or become eligible to receive annual incentive
compensation hereunder shall be deemed to give such person any right to be
retained in the employ of 3M or to interfere with the right of 3M to discipline
or terminate the employment of such person at any time for any reason
whatsoever. No person shall have any claim or right to receive annual incentive
compensation under this Plan, except as provided in accordance with the
provisions of this Plan and as approved by the Committee. If a Participants
employment with 3M terminates for any reason other than death or Retirement,
participation in this Plan will end and any annual incentive compensation that
would otherwise have been payable to such Participant for the Plan Year in
which such termination occurs shall be forfeited.
10.         Withholding.
All payments of annual
incentive compensation made pursuant to this Plan will be subject to
withholding for all applicable taxes and contributions required by law to be
withheld therefrom.
H-2 


11.         No
Assignment.
No right or interest of a
Participant under this Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or subject to
the claims of any creditor or to any liens.
12.         Successors.
All obligations of 3M under this Plan with respect to
the payment of annual incentive compensation will be binding upon any successor
to 3M, regardless of the reason or circumstances for such succession (whether
by reason of merger, consolidation, or the purchase of substantially all of the
business and assets of 3M).
13.         Validity.
In the event any provision of
this Plan should be determined to be illegal or invalid for any reason, it
shall not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan which shall remain in
effect as if the illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. If
any provision of this Plan would cause the annual incentive compensation
payable hereunder not to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, that provision will be deemed severed
from the Plan without affecting the remaining provisions of the Plan.
14.         Governing
Law.
The provisions of this Plan shall be governed by, and
interpreted and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware.

In accordance with the terms of the VIP and Savings

and in accordance with the judgment of the trustee upon other business as may
properly come before the meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof.

how to vote a proportionate number of both the 3M shares held by the VIP that
