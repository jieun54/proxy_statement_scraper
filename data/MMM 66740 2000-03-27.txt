                      3M CENTER, ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA 55144

                                 March 27, 2000



               PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
                       TO BE HELD ON TUESDAY, MAY 9, 2000


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND THE ANNUAL MEETING

     Q: WHY AM I RECEIVING THESE MATERIALS?

     A: The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Company (sometimes referred to as the "Company" or "3M") is
providing these proxy materials to you in connection with the solicitation by
the Board of proxies to be voted at 3M's Annual Meeting of Stockholders which
will take place on May 9, 2000. You are invited to attend the meeting and are
requested to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement.

     Q: WHAT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THESE MATERIALS?

     A: The information included in this proxy statement relates to the
proposals to be voted on at the meeting, the voting process, the compensation of
directors and our most highly paid officers, and certain other required
information. Our 1999 Annual Report is enclosed in this mailing and also
available to those accessing the proxy statement via the Internet.

     Q: WHAT PROPOSALS WILL BE VOTED ON AT THE MEETING?


     A: There are four proposals scheduled to be voted on at the meeting:

          *    The election of directors to the 2003 Class.

          *    Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
               independent auditors, to audit the consolidated financial
               statements of the Company for the year 2000.

          *    Approval of an amendment to the Restated Certificate of
               Incorporation to increase the authorized common stock.

          *    Approval of an amendment to the Restated Certificate of
               Incorporation to change par value.

     Q: WHAT ARE 3M'S VOTING RECOMMENDATIONS?

     A: Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote your shares "FOR" each
of the nominees to the Board and "FOR" each of the other proposals.


     Q: WHAT SHARES OWNED BY ME CAN BE VOTED?


     A: All shares owned by you as of March 10, 2000, the RECORD DATE, may be
voted by you. These shares include those (1) held directly in your name as the
STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD, including shares purchased through 3M's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan and 3M's General Employees Stock Purchase Plan and (2) held
for you as the BENEFICIAL OWNER through a stockbroker, bank, or other nominee,
including those shares acquired through 3M's Voluntary Investment Plan, Employee
Stock Ownership Plan, or Savings Plan.

     Participants in 3M's Voluntary Investment Plan, Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, or Savings Plan may direct the trustee how to vote the shares allocated to
the participant's account by following the voting instructions contained on the
proxy card. The trustee of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan also votes
allocated shares of common stock for which it has not received direction, as
well as shares not allocated to individual participant accounts, in the same
proportion as it votes those directed shares for which voting instructions are
received. If voting instructions are invalid or if the proxy card is not
returned by the specified date, the trustee will vote the shares held in the
stockholder's Savings Plan and Voluntary Investment Plan accounts as directed by
the Public Issues Committee of the 3M Board of Directors.



                                        1



     Q: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A STOCKHOLDER OF
RECORD AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER?


     A: Most 3M stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, or
other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there
are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned
beneficially:


          *    STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD -- If your shares are registered directly
               in your name with 3M's Transfer Agent, Norwest Bank Minnesota,
               N.A., you are considered, with respect to those shares, the
               STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD and these proxy materials are being sent
               directly to you by 3M. As the STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD, you have the
               right to grant your voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in
               person at the meeting. 3M has enclosed a proxy card for you to
               use.

          *    BENEFICIAL OWNER -- If your shares are held in a stock brokerage
               account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the
               BENEFICIAL OWNER of shares held IN STREET NAME and these proxy
               materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or nominee
               who is considered, with respect to those shares, the STOCKHOLDER
               OF RECORD. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct
               your broker on how to vote and are also invited to attend the
               meeting. However, since you are not the STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD,
               you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting. Your
               broker or nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting
               instruction card for you to use.

     Q: HOW CAN I VOTE MY SHARES?

     A: Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or
beneficially in street name, you may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares
held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or
nominee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet, by
telephone, or by mail. Please refer to the summary instructions below and those
included on your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting
instruction card included by your broker or nominee.

          *    BY INTERNET -- If you have Internet access, you may submit your
               proxy from any location in the world by following the "Vote by
               Internet" instructions on the proxy card.

          *    BY TELEPHONE -- If you live in the United States, you may submit
               your proxy by following the "Vote by Phone" instructions on the
               proxy card.


          *    BY MAIL -- You may do this by signing your proxy card or, for
               shares held in street name, the voting instruction card included
               by your broker or nominee and mailing it in the enclosed, postage
               prepaid and addressed envelope. If you provide specific voting
               instructions, your shares will be voted as you instruct. If you
               sign, but do not provide instructions, your shares will be voted
               as described below in "HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED?"


     Q: CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE?

     A: You may change your proxy instructions at any time prior to the vote at
the Annual Meeting. For shares held directly in your name, you may accomplish
this by granting a new proxy or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in
person. Attendance at the meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy
to be revoked unless you specifically so request. For shares held beneficially
by you, you may accomplish this by submitting new voting instructions to your
broker or nominee.

     Q: HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED?


     A: In the election of directors, you may vote "FOR" all of the nominees or
your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to one or more of the nominees. For
the other proposals, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN." If you
"ABSTAIN," it has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." If you sign your proxy
card or broker voting instruction card with no further instructions, your
shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board,
except that any shares you hold in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, Savings
Plan, and Voluntary Investment Plan will be voted by the trustee as described
on page 1 in "WHAT SHARES OWNED BY ME CAN BE VOTED?"



                                        2



     Q: WHAT IS THE VOTING REQUIREMENT TO APPROVE EACH OF THE PROPOSALS?


     A: The nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting will be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting. The affirmative "FOR" vote of the holders
of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote is required to amend
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized
shares of common stock and change par value. All other proposals require the
affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of those shares present and entitled to
vote. If you are a BENEFICIAL OWNER and do not provide the STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD
with voting instructions, your shares may constitute BROKER NON-VOTES, as
described in "WHAT IS THE QUORUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEETING?" on page 3. In
tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute
BROKER NON-VOTES are not considered entitled to vote.


     Q: WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF I RECEIVE MORE THAN ONE PROXY OR VOTING
INSTRUCTION CARD?

     A: It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one
account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy and voting
instruction cards you receive.

     Q: HOW CAN I OBTAIN AN ADMISSION TICKET FOR THE MEETING?

     A: Two cutout admission tickets are included on the back of this proxy
statement.

     Q: WHERE CAN I FIND THE VOTING RESULTS OF THE MEETING?


     A: We will announce preliminary voting results at the meeting and publish
final results in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q. A news release with voting
results will be available on our website
(www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.html). Voting results also will be mailed
with dividend checks payable June 12.


     Q: WHAT CLASS OF SHARES IS ENTITLED TO BE VOTED?


     A: Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the close of business
on March 10, 2000, the RECORD DATE, is entitled to one vote at the Annual
Meeting. On February 29, 2000, we had 397,140,724 shares of common stock issued
and outstanding. The 74,875,804 shares of common stock in the Company's treasury
on that date will not be voted.


     Q: WHAT IS THE QUORUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEETING?

     A: The quorum requirement for holding the meeting and transacting business
is a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to be voted. The shares may be
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting. Both abstentions and
broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining the
presence of a quorum. Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a
broker for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular
proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting instructions from the
beneficial owner and (2) the broker lacks discretionary voting power to vote
such shares.

     Q: WHO WILL COUNT THE VOTE?

     A: Representatives of Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., 3M's transfer agent,
will tabulate the votes and act as the inspector of election.

     Q: IS MY VOTE CONFIDENTIAL?

     A: The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a policy that all
stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify stockholders are to
be maintained in confidence. No such document shall be available for
examination, nor shall the identity and vote of any stockholder be disclosed,
except as may be necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to allow
the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes shall be
independent and shall not be employees of the Company. Occasionally,
stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded
to 3M management.


                                        3



     Q: WHO WILL BEAR THE COST OF SOLICITING VOTES FOR THE MEETING?


     A: 3M will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing,
and distributing these proxy materials, except that certain expenses for
Internet access will be incurred by you if you choose to access the proxy
materials and/or vote over the Internet. In addition to the mailing of these
proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made in person, by
telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and
employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such
solicitation activities. We also have hired Georgeson Shareholder
Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the
solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc. a
fee of $15,000 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation
materials to beneficial owners of stock.


     ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND INFORMATION REGARDING ACCESS TO FUTURE ANNUAL
REPORTS AND PROXY STATEMENTS VIA THE INTERNET AND STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS MAY BE
FOUND ON PAGE 26.

                                 PROPOSAL NO. 2

                      RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

     The Audit Committee recommended and the Board of Directors appointed the
firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditors, to audit the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the
year 2000. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Board of Directors will reconsider the
selection.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company's consolidated financial
statements since 1975. The firm has offices and affiliates in most localities
throughout the world where the Company has operations. Audit services provided
by the firm in 1999 included: audit of consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries; limited reviews of interim reports; reviews of
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; consultations on matters
related to accounting and financial reporting; audits of statutory financial
statements for certain foreign subsidiaries; and audits of the financial
statements of the Company's benefit plans.

     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also provided a number of nonaudit services
during 1999, all of which were approved and reviewed by the Audit Committee.

     A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is expected to be present at
the stockholders meeting and available to respond to appropriate questions and
will be given an opportunity to make a statement, if the representative chooses
to do so.


     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE
APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS, TO AUDIT THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY FOR 2000. PROXIES SOLICITED BY
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED "FOR" RATIFICATION UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE
IS SPECIFIED.


                              PROPOSALS NO. 3 AND 4

                     PROPOSALS TO APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE
                      RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

     The Board of Directors believes that it is in the Company's best interest
to amend the Company's restated certificate of incorporation to (i) increase the
number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue to 1.5
billion, and (ii) to change the par value of the Company's common stock to $0.01
per share.

     Accordingly, at its meeting held on February 14, 2000, the Board of
Directors unanimously adopted a resolution proposing that an amendment to
paragraph A of Article FOURTH of the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (and a conforming change to the third sentence of paragraph A of
Article TENTH) be presented to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting for their
approval. Such amendment would change the number of authorized shares of common
stock and the par value and convert the issued shares of stock to shares with
the new par value. As amended, paragraph A of Article FOURTH would read in its
entirety as follows:

          "FOURTH: A. The total number of shares of all classes of stock which
     this Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,510,000,000 consisting
     of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without par value and 1,500,000,000
     shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. Upon the
     effectiveness of the amendment of this Article Fourth reducing the par
     value of the common stock to $0.01, each outstanding share of common stock
     shall be reclassified and changed into one share of common stock, par value
     $0.01 per share."

     If the amendment is approved by stockholders, the amendment would also
change the reference to par value in the third sentence of paragraph A of
Article TENTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to $0.01 per share.

     In compliance with SEC rules, this amendment will be separated into two
proposals for consideration by stockholders -- Proposal No. 3 sets forth the
proposed amendment to increase the authorized common stock and Proposal No. 4
sets forth the proposed amendment to change the par value.



                                       11




     If stockholders approve Proposal No. 3 but not Proposal No. 4, then the
Company will proceed only with amending the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock the Company is
authorized to issue. Such amendment will become effective upon the filing of a
Certificate of Amendment in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
Delaware. If stockholders approve Proposal No. 4 but not Proposal No. 3, then,
before the effectiveness of the amendment set forth in Proposal No. 4, the
Board reserves the right to abandon the amendment set forth in Proposal No. 4
without further action by stockholders, notwithstanding the authorization of
the amendment by stockholders.

     If stockholders approve both Proposals, then the amendment to increase the
number of authorized shares of common stock and change par value will become
effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of Delaware.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL
NO. 3 AND PROPOSAL NO. 4. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE
VOTED FOR THESE PROPOSALS UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE IS SPECIFIED.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 3

         PROPOSAL TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
              INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK

     The Board of Directors believes that it is in the Company's best interest
to amend the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the
number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue to 1.5
billion.

     As of February 29, 2000, 472,016,528 shares of common stock were issued,
including 397,140,724 outstanding shares and 74,875,804 shares held by the
Company in treasury. Approximately 31,000,000 shares were under option to
participants in the Company's stock option plans. As of the close of business on
February 29, 2000, none of the Company's 10,000,000 shares of authorized
preferred stock have been issued.

     The Board of Directors has concluded that increasing the number of
authorized shares of common stock will give the Company the ability to respond
to growth of the Company's business that may occur in the future and to react
quickly to today's competitive, fast-changing environment. Since 1920, the
Company effected seven 2-for-1, one 3-for-1 and one 4-for-1 stock splits
following significant increases in the market price for 3M common stock.
Although the Board has not determined when and under what conditions it would
consider a stock split, the Board believes that the increase in the number of
authorized shares will provide flexibility in considering future stock splits
(effected in the form of a stock dividend) without the expense of a special
stockholder meeting or waiting until the next annual meeting. Although the
Company has no specific plans or commitments for the issuance of any of the
additional shares that would be authorized by the amendment, the Board of
Directors also believes that an increase in the authorized shares is desirable
because it would provide the Company flexibility for other actions the Company
might wish to take. These actions include, paying for acquisitions with stock of
the Company, equity offerings to raise capital, and employee benefit plans.

     Accordingly, at its meeting held on February 14, 2000, the Board of
Directors unanimously adopted a resolution proposing that an amendment to
paragraph A of Article FOURTH of the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation be presented to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting for their
approval. Such amendment would change the number of authorized shares of common
stock the Company is authorized to issue to 1.5 billion.

     If the proposed amendment is approved, the Board of Directors may issue
such shares without further stockholder action except as required by law or
applicable stock exchange requirements. The additional shares, when issued, will
have the same voting and other rights as the Company's presently authorized
common stock. The holders of common stock do not have preemptive rights to
subscribe for additional shares of common stock.

     Although the Board has no present intention of issuing any additional
shares of common stock as an anti-takeover step, the issuance of additional
common shares could be used to create impediments



                                       12




to or otherwise discourage persons attempting to gain control of the Company.
For example, the issuance of additional shares could be used in a manner that
would dilute the voting power of shares then outstanding. Shares of common stock
could also be issued to persons or entities who would support the Board of
Directors in opposing a takeover bid which the Board determines to be not in the
best interests of the Company, its stockholders, and its employees.

     The affirmative "FOR" vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
common stock entitled to vote is required to approve this amendment to the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS
PROPOSAL. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR THIS
PROPOSAL UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE IS SPECIFIED.


                                 PROPOSAL NO. 4

         PROPOSAL TO APPROVE AN AMENDMENT TO THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF
                        INCORPORATION TO CHANGE PAR VALUE

     The Board of Directors believes that it is in the Company's best interest
to amend the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to change the par
value of the Company's common stock to $0.01 per share. The change to "$0.01 par
value" common stock will have no impact on value of the Company's stock or the
rights of its stockholders. If the stockholders approve the proposed amendment,
the change in par value will, however, enable the Company to realize significant
reductions in the amount of the filing fees charged by various states for filing
its amended Certificate of Incorporation.

     Accordingly, at its meeting held on February 14, 2000, the Board of
Directors unanimously adopted a resolution proposing that an amendment to
paragraph A of Article FOURTH of the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation (and a conforming change to the third sentence of paragraph A of
Article TENTH) be presented to the stockholders at the Annual Meeting for their
approval. Such amendment would change the par value to $0.01 per share and
convert the issued shares of stock to shares with the new par value.

     If stockholders approve the amendment, the amendment would also change the
reference to par value in the third sentence of paragraph A of Article TENTH of
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to $0.01 per share.

     The affirmative "FOR" vote by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
common stock entitled to vote is required to approve this amendment to the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

     THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THIS
PROPOSAL. PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR THIS
PROPOSAL UNLESS A CONTRARY VOTE IS SPECIFIED.



COMMON STOCK OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

     The following table sets forth information concerning beneficial ownership
of the Company's common stock as of February 29, 2000, for: (a) each director
and the nominee for director; (b) the three most highly compensated executive
officers who are not also directors; and (c) the directors and executive
officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, each person has sole investment
and voting power (or shares such powers with his or her spouse) with respect to
the shares set forth in the following table.


     The number of shares beneficially owned by each director or executive
officer is determined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for
any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as
to which the individual has the sole or shared voting power or investment power
and also any shares which the individual has the right to acquire as of April
29, 2000 (60 days after February 29, 2000), through the exercise of any stock
option or other right. Options exercisable within 60 days after February 29,
2000, are shown separately.

(1) "Shares Held" include: stock held in joint tenancy, stock owned as tenants
in common, stock owned or held by spouse or other members of the nominee's
household, and stock in which the nominee either has or shares voting and/or
investment power, even though the nominee disclaims any beneficial interest in
such stock. Options exercisable within 60 days after February 29, 2000 are shown
separately. The "shares held" include shares of Profit Sharing Stock held by the
Company and subject to forfeiture, as more fully described in footnote 3 on page
16 of this proxy statement.


(2) Option prices for these shares range from $38.63 to $93.35 per share.


(3) "Shares Held as Deferred Stock" by nonemployee directors represent the
number of shares of the Company's common stock, as of February 29, 2000, which
the directors will receive upon termination of membership on the Board of
Directors for any reason. These shares result from the voluntary election by the
nonemployee directors to defer the payment of directors' fees. No shares of
common



                                       14



stock have as yet been issued, and the directors have neither voting nor
investment powers in these shares of deferred stock.

(4) All directors and executive officers as a group owned beneficially less than
one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the outstanding common stock of the Company.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

     Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors
and executive officers to file with the Securities Exchange Commission reports
regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our stock. 3M believes
that during 1999, its directors and executive officers complied with all Section
16(a) filing requirements with the following exceptions (1) one late report
filed by John W. Benson, Executive Vice President, Health Care Markets, with
respect to a gift of shares to charity and his children; (2) one late report
filed by Raymond C. Richelsen, Executive Vice President, Transportation,
Graphics and Safety Markets, with respect to a gift of shares to charity; (3)
one late report filed by W. George Meredith, former Director and Executive Vice
President, Corporate Services and Supply Chain Management, with respect to an
exercise of a stock option; and (4) one late report filed by David W. Powell,
Vice President, Marketing, with respect to an amendment to the initial Form 3 to
add additional shares held in street name. In making this statement, 3M has
relied upon the written representations of its directors and officers.


TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT

     During 1999, nine executive officers had loans outstanding with the Eastern
Heights Bank, a subsidiary of the Company. These loans were made in the ordinary
course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with
other persons of comparable circumstances and did not involve more than normal
risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. In 1999, the
Company sold Eastern Heights Bank to Norwest Bank Minnesota.

Officer and its four other most highly paid executive officers for 1999, 1998,

(1) The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table do not include amounts
expensed for financial reporting purposes under the Company's pension plan. This
plan is a defined benefit plan. The amounts shown in the table do, however,
include those amounts voluntarily deferred by the named individuals under the
Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allows
management personnel to defer portions of current base salary, profit sharing,
and performance unit compensation earned during the year.


(2) The amounts shown under the headings "Profit Sharing Cash (Bonus)" and
"Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock Awards)" are payments received under the
Profit Sharing Plan. The terms "(Bonus)" and "(Restricted Stock Awards)" are
included to satisfy the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"). These payments are based upon the Company's performance and are
variable in accordance with a predetermined formula. The Compensation Committee
does not view these payments as bonus payments or restricted stock awards as
these terms are most often used. The Committee views bonus plans as plans which
provide for annual (as opposed to quarterly) payments from a pool rather than
based on a strict formula related to economic profit. Restricted stock awards
are generally outright grants of stock as opposed to payment in the form of
stock held in the custody of the Company (restricted period) in lieu of cash
under a formula-based profit sharing plan.


     Generally, profit sharing is paid in cash; however, senior executive
management, as determined by the Compensation Committee, receive a portion of
their profit sharing in shares of the Company's common stock (see footnote 3 on
page 16).

     The Company's Profit Sharing Plan provides for quarterly payments based
upon the number of shares of profit sharing assigned to a participant,
multiplied by an amount based on economic profit. Economic profit is defined as
quarterly net operating income minus a capital charge, and emphasizes the
effective use of working capital.


     The number of profit sharing shares awarded to the individuals named is
determined by the Compensation Committee and is intended to reflect the level of
responsibility of the respective individual. Profit sharing payments are subject
to limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to base
salary. Approximately 15,300 employees currently participate in profit sharing,
including the five individuals in the Summary Compensation Table.

(3) The amount shown under the heading "Profit Sharing Stock (Restricted Stock
Awards)" represents the portion of profit sharing issued as common stock to the
named individuals, valued at 100 percent of the fair market value of the
Company's common stock at the end of the quarterly profit sharing performance
period. The number of shares is determined by the Company's quarterly economic
profit performance. However, payment is deferred and conditional upon continued
employment by the Company. Therefore, pursuant to SEC rules, it is included
under the headings of "Long-Term Compensation."


     The shares are held in the custody of the Company for a period of three
years or until age 65, whichever occurs first. Any termination of employment,
prior to that time, without the consent of the Compensation Committee or the
Board of Directors, other than upon death or permanent disability, will result
in forfeiture of the Profit Sharing Stock. The recipient is entitled to receive
dividends and vote these shares in the same manner as any other holder of the
Company's common stock during the period of custody by the Company. In 1999, the
Company distributed a portion of these shares to Messrs. DeSimone, Baukol, and
Agostini.

     From the time of issuance throughout the Restricted Period, Profit Sharing
Stock rises or falls in value in direct relationship to the Company's common
stock market performance. Consequently, Profit Sharing Stock reflects both
short-term and long-term performance elements.


                                       16



     The named individuals have accumulated as of December 31, 1999, in one case
over ten years, the following shares of the Company's common stock under the
Company's Profit Sharing Plan. The Profit Sharing Stock is valued in this table
at the fair market value of such stock on December 31, 1999, and also on the
respective dates when the shares were issued into the custody of the Company:

(4) "Other Annual Compensation" includes the following, to the extent that the
aggregate thereof exceeds $50,000: personal benefits received by the named
individuals, amounts reimbursed to the individuals during the year for payment
of taxes, and that portion of interest above market rates (as determined by the
SEC) paid on that compensation voluntarily deferred by the individuals. The
personal benefits included in these numbers represent the amount of personal
financial planning services, an amount paid on behalf of the individual for the
term portion of insurance under the Company's Senior Executive Split Dollar
Plan, and air travel on corporate aircraft imputed to the individual as income
for tax purposes. In the case of Mr. DeSimone, nearly all of the "Other Annual
Compensation" received in 1999, 1998, and 1997 was a result of income imputed to
him for travel.

(5) The number of stock options shown in this column includes both annual grants
of incentive and nonqualified stock options and Progressive Stock Options, which
are described more fully in footnote 1 on page 18. The number and price of all
outstanding options were adjusted at the spin-off of Imation Corp. in order to
preserve the intrinsic value of the options. The number of stock options shown
in this column for 1999 reflects this adjustment.


(6) "Performance Unit Plan (LTIP) Payouts" reflects the value of the total grant
for each individual under the Company's Performance Unit Plan after the base
three-year performance period (i.e., the amount shown in 1999 covers the base
performance period from 1997-1999). Under the 1999 award, the amount earned will
be paid to these individuals in 2002, unless the participant elects to defer the
payout for three additional years. The numbers shown represent estimates based
upon information available as of February 29, 2000. More specific information
about the Performance Unit Plan is set forth on pages 20 and 23.


(7) "All Other Compensation" includes: (a) that amount of Performance Unit Plan
earnings allocated during the year to the base amounts determined after the
three-year performance periods of each respective grant, to the extent that such
earnings are in excess of market interest rates (as determined by the SEC); (b)
that amount deemed to be compensation to the individuals under the Company's
Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan in accordance with rules developed by the
SEC; and (c) all amounts contributed to the account of each named executive
under the Company's 401(k) plan. The Senior Executive Split Dollar Plan provides
insurance to all of the Company's executive officers under split dollar life
insurance, which is partly term insurance and partly whole life insurance with a
cash value. Under this Plan, the Company is reimbursed for the premium costs of
the non-term portion of coverage and a possible return when the arrangement
terminates either by insurance proceeds incident to the death of the individual
or by cash value after 15 years of participation in the Plan. During 1999,
amounts deemed compensation under the Plan to the named executive officers in
the Summary Compensation Table were $7,667 for Mr. DeSimone; $15,522 for Mr.
Baukol; $11,137 for Mr. Agostini; $13,122 for Mr. Benson; and $21,060 for Mr.
Richelsen. These amounts were determined by treating the non-term portion of the
coverage as an interest-free loan.

(1) The Company has not granted any Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), except
in limited circumstances to employees of certain subsidiaries who are not
subject to the tax laws of the United States where SARs have less onerous tax
consequences than stock options. The options shown for each individual include
both annual grants of Incentive Stock Options and nonqualified stock options and
grants of Progressive Stock Options ("PSOs"). Nonqualified options are subject
to a reload feature when exercised with the payment of the option price in the
form of previously owned shares of the Company's common stock. Such an exercise
results in further grants of PSOs. The first grant shown for each individual is
the annual grant. The remaining lines are PSOs. The PSO grants for each
individual were made on a single date, but are, pursuant to SEC rules, shown in
multiple lines because of different expiration dates.


     PSO grants were made to participants who exercised nonqualified stock
options and who paid the purchase price using shares of previously owned Company
common stock. The PSO grant is for the number of shares equal to the shares
utilized in payment of the purchase price and tax withholding, if any. The
option price for the PSO is equal to 100 percent of the market value of the
Company's common stock on the date of the exercise of the primary option or,
alternatively, on the date of the PSO grant to the five named individuals in the
table, all of whom are subject to the requirements of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The option period is equal to the remaining period of the
options exercised.


                                       18




     The participant must have owned Company common stock used for payment for
at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified options per
participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO grants by the
Compensation Committee.


     The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of nonqualified stock
options, without foregoing the opportunity for further appreciation, and
promotes retention of the Company stock acquired.

     In any event, a participant receiving an annual grant of nonqualified stock
options can never acquire more shares of Company common stock through successive
exercises of the initial and subsequent PSO grants than the number of shares
covered by the initial annual grant from the Committee.


(2) All options granted during the period were granted at the market value on
the date of grant if initial grants, or at the fair market values discussed in
footnote 1 above in the case of PSOs, as calculated from the average of the high
and low prices reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index. The
option price shown for the "All Optionees" line is $94.32 and represents the
weighted average exercise price of the options granted in 1999.


(3) The expiration date for the "All Optionees" line is shown as May 10, 2009,
since that is the applicable date for the vast majority of options granted
during 1999.


(4) Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, the Company has elected to provide a grant
date present value for these option grants determined by a modified
Black-Scholes pricing model. The Company's use of this model should not be
construed as an endorsement of its accuracy at valuing options. All stock option
valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require a prediction about
the future movement of the stock price. Among key assumptions utilized in this
pricing model were: (i) that the time of exercise of stock options would be 66
months (26 months for PSOs) into the term of the option, which could be for
terms as long as ten years, in recognition of the historical exercise patterns
at the Company for these types of options; (ii) expected volatility of 22.3
percent (28.8 percent for PSOs); (iii) risk-free rate of return of 5.4 percent
(5.4 percent for PSOs); and (iv) dividend growth rate of 5 percent. No
adjustments for non-transferability or risk of forfeiture have been made. The
Company expresses no opinion that the present value will, in fact, be realized
and expressly disclaims any representation to that effect.

(1) The "Value Realized" or the unrealized "Value of Unexercised In-the-Money
Options at FY-End" represents the aggregate difference between the market value
on the date of exercise or at December 31, 1999, in the case of the unrealized
values, and the applicable exercise prices. These differences accumulate over
what may be, in many cases, several years. These stock options all have option
periods of ten years when first granted, and Progressive Stock Options have
option periods equal to the remaining option period of the initial nonqualified
options resulting in Progressive Stock Options.

(1) The Company's Performance Unit Plan provides long-term compensation to 99
key management personnel based upon the Company's attainment of long-term
performance and growth criteria.

     The Compensation Committee, of which none of the members are current
employees of the Company, administers the Plan. The Committee has sole
discretion in the selection of participants, performance criteria, size of
awards, performance period, and the timing and form of payment, as well as all
other conditions regarding awards.

     Awards made in 1999 under the Performance Unit Plan are based on
performance criteria that focus management attention on two key factors that
create shareholder value: Real Growth and Economic Profit. The payout can vary
from $0 to $200 per unit. The payout can be reached by either performance
criteria alone, or by both in combination. The payout may be deferred by the
participant for three additional years and earn interest at a specified rate. No
amount will be payable under the Performance Unit Plan if the Company's Real
Growth is less than the Big 7 IPI and if Economic Profit is less than 75 percent
of the Economic Profit of the previous three years. More detail about current
performance goals is available in the Report of Compensation Committee on page
23.


     The right to receive payment is contingent upon continued employment to the
payment date, and is subject to forfeiture prior to the payment date in the
event of termination of employment for any reason other than retirement under a
pension plan of the Company or physical or mental disability. Participants
receiving awards during 1999, including the five executive officers in the
Summary Compensation Table, will receive payment in 2002, provided that such
individuals continue employment with the Company until such payment date (except
in the event of death, retirement, or disability). Payment under the Plan may be
made in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination of cash
and stock, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In the past, payment
has been made only in cash.


(2) The value of awards granted for 1999 will be determined by the Company's
attainment of Real Growth and Economic Profit performance criteria during a
three-year performance period of 1999, 2000, and 2001. More detail about current
performance goals is available in the Compensation Committee Report on page 23.
At the beginning of every performance period, participants may elect to defer
the payout for three years beyond the base performance period (for the 1999
award, the payout will be made the beginning of 2002, unless the participant
elects to defer the payout for three additional years). Participants will earn
interest during the deferral period. The deferred amount will be subject to
forfeiture if the participant discontinues employment for any reason other than
death, disability, or retirement.

(3) The estimated future payouts do not include any interest factor that would
be earned annually during the optional three-year deferral period following the
performance period. Interest during the optional three-year deferral period
would accrue annually at a rate equal to the annualized yield to maturity of a
five-year Treasury note as of the last business day of the preceding year (for
1998, that rate was 4.54 percent) PLUS an amount based on the Company's Economic
Profit for the preceding year as a percentage of the average operating capital
(for 1998, that rate was 5.9 percent). The interest would be payable, together
with the base award, in January 2005.

(1) Earnings include base salary, profit sharing cash, and the value of Profit
Sharing Stock (at the time of award) actually earned by the participant and does
not include any other forms of remuneration. The benefits are computed on the
basis of straight-life annuity amounts and are not subject to any deduction for
Social Security or other offset amounts.

(2) To provide for the retirement security of its employees, the Company has
defined benefit pension plans for U.S. employees. These plans are fully paid by
the Company, and employees become vested after five years of service. Under the
plans, a participant may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62
for employees born after 1942) and if the participant's age and years of service
total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942) he or she would
receive a Social Security bridge to age 62. The five individuals listed in the
Summary Compensation Table are presently entitled to the respective years of
service credit set opposite their names:

REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

     This report was prepared at the direction of the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), which is composed entirely of
nonemployee directors of the Company. The Committee establishes and periodically
reviews compensation levels and policies for the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")
and other executive officers and authorizes short-term and long-term
compensation in the form of cash or stock. The current members of the Committee
are Edward A. Brennan, who serves as Chair, Allen E. Murray, Rozanne L. Ridgway,
and Frank Shrontz.

COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES


     The executive compensation program is designed to align total compensation
with the Company's strategic objectives and ensure that payouts are driven by
Company performance and employee contribution to the Company. Executive
compensation is linked to Company performance compared to specific financial and
nonfinancial objectives. These objectives range from achieving earnings and
sales growth targets to upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate Values
(which include customer satisfaction through superior quality and value,
attractive investor return, ethical business conduct, respecting the
environment, and fostering employee pride in the Company).


     In determining the amount and type of executive compensation, the Committee
seeks to achieve the following objectives:

     *    To attract, motivate, and retain talented, competent, and resourceful
          executive officers by providing competitive compensation.


                                       21



     *    To encourage executives to hold significant amounts of Company stock.

     *    To require that a substantial portion of executive compensation is "at
          risk" by being tied to quantifiable short-term and long-term measures
          of the Company's performance.

PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING COMPENSATION

     The Committee begins the process of establishing the amount of compensation
for the CEO and other executive officers by reviewing compensation surveys of
selected companies. Independent consultants specializing in executive
compensation primarily conduct the surveys. The Committee, in consultation with
the independent consultants, selects the companies included in the compensation
surveys. These companies consist of large industrial companies that are most
likely to be competitors for executive talent. The objective of the Committee is
to use the survey data to establish a competitive level of total compensation.
The Committee believes that the Company's most direct competitors for executive
talent are not necessarily all of the companies that would be included in a
group established to compare shareholder returns. Thus, the group of companies
for purposes of the compensation surveys is not the same as the peer group index
(DJIA and S&P 500) in the Comparison of Five-Year Cumulative Total Return graph
included on page 25 of this proxy statement.

     The Committee does not target any specific quartile of the survey data for
total compensation or any component of total compensation (e.g., base salary,
profit sharing, performance unit plan, or stock options). The Committee's
objective of maintaining the total compensation at a competitive level has
resulted in short-term compensation (base salary and profit sharing cash) and
long-term compensation (performance unit plan, profit sharing stock, and stock
options) being at or very close to the median.

     After the Committee has established the amount of total compensation for
the CEO and other executive officers, the Committee next determines what percent
of the total compensation should be allocated to short-term compensation in the
form of base salary and profit sharing cash and long-term compensation in the
form of the performance unit plan, profit sharing stock, and stock options. This
determination is subjective, but is based on information from the compensation
surveys and the objectives for executive compensation referred to above. It is
the Committee's long-standing policy that variable, at-risk compensation, both
short-term and long-term, should make up a significant portion of executive
compensation. Depending upon the level of the executive, the Committee targets
between 65 percent and 85 percent of executive compensation to be variable and
at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures of the Company's performance.

ELEMENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

     Each of the components of short-term and long-term executive compensation
is described in greater detail below.

BASE SALARY

     The Committee establishes base salaries annually in relation to base
salaries paid by the selected companies from the compensation surveys. Base
salaries may be adjusted from time to time according to guidelines established
for all employees to reflect increased salary levels within the group, increased
responsibilities, or individual performance. This is the only component of
executive compensation that is not variable.

PROFIT SHARING

     Profit sharing is variable compensation based on quarterly performance
measurements for the Company. In 1999, the stockholders approved the change in
performance criteria recommended by the Compensation Committee from consolidated
net income to economic profit. Economic profit is defined as quarterly net
operating income minus a capital charge and emphasizes the effective use of
working capital. The economic profit measurement is deemed by the Committee to
be related more directly to the creation of stockholder value and will be more
sensitive to the performance of the Company. Thus, it is expected that
compensation paid under the new measurement will tend to rise and fall
relatively more sharply than payments under prior measurement criteria. The
Committee, as part of the overall compensation, determines number of shares of
profit sharing granted to the CEO and executive officers to achieve the
appropriate ratio between short-term, performance-based compensation and other
forms of compensation, and to reflect the level of responsibility of the
respective executive officer.



                                       22



     The amount payable under this plan shall be based on the number of shares
of profit sharing assigned to a participant, multiplied by an amount based on
quarterly economic profit. The total paid under this plan to the Company's five
most highly compensated officers will never exceed one-half percent of the
consolidated net income of the Company. Profit sharing payments are subject to
limitations when individual amounts exceed specified relationships to base
salary.


     For the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table, a
portion of profit sharing is paid in cash and a portion is paid in stock which
is held by the Company for three years or until age 65, whichever occurs first.
The ratio between that portion of profit sharing paid in cash and the portion
paid in stock to the named executive officers for 1999 is subjective and varies
from year to year and among executive officers. However, the more senior
executive officers generally have been paid a larger portion of profit sharing
in stock than less senior executive officers. More details about the Company's
Profit Sharing Plan are provided on page 16 of this proxy statement.


PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN

     The Performance Unit Plan is variable compensation based on the Company's
long-term performance. The Committee establishes the number of performance units
allocated to the CEO and executive officers to achieve the appropriate ratio
between long-term, performance-based compensation and other forms of
compensation. The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted
is determined by and is contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria
described below over the applicable three-year performance period (each year
weighted equally).

     The current performance criteria have been selected to focus management
attention on two key factors that create shareholder value: Real Growth and
Economic Profit.

     PERFORMANCE CRITERIA:


     (1) "Real Growth" is the percentage amount by which the Company's worldwide
unit sales growth as reported in the Company's Annual Report exceeds the
weighted average of the Industrial Production Index ("IPI") of the top seven
industrial nations in which the Company does business (the "Big 7 IPI"); and

     (2) "Economic Profit" is the Company's net operating income (operating
income adjusted for income taxes) less the cost of capital utilized (average
operating capital multiplied by the cost of capital).


     PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN PAYMENTS:


     The amount payable with respect to each performance unit granted in 1999 is
linked to the performance criteria of Real Growth and Economic Profit. The
payout can vary from $0 to $200 per unit. The payout can be reached by either
performance criteria alone, or by both in combination. The payout for the 1999
Award is payable in May 2002, in the form (at the discretion of the Committee)
of cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock. The payout may be deferred
by the participant for three additional years and earn interest at a specified
rate. No amount will be payable under the Performance Unit Plan if the Company's
Real Growth is less than the Big 7 IPI and if Economic Profit is less than 75
percent of the Economic Profit of the previous three years.


STOCK OPTIONS

     The Company's Stock Option plan is also variable compensation. It is based
on the market appreciation of the Company's common stock and is designed to
increase ownership of the Company's stock. The Company makes stock option grants
annually at 100 percent of the market price on the date of grant. The options
may be exercised after one year and have a ten-year life. The number of shares
under options to be granted to the CEO and executive officers is determined by
the Committee as part of the overall compensation. The awards are designed to
keep total compensation competitive with companies in the survey group, and as
such require subjective judgment as to the value of the award. The number of
option shares currently held by each executive is not considered in determining
awards. Stock options encourage executives to become owners of the Company,
which further aligns their interests with the stockholders. Options have no
value unless the price of the Company's stock increases.


                                       23



CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION

     The compensation of Livio D. DeSimone, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, is determined by the same process and consists of the same
short-term and long-term components as for the other executive officers listed
in the Summary Compensation Table, namely base salary, profit sharing,
Performance Unit Plan, and stock options. A higher portion of Mr. DeSimone's
total compensation is variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable
measures of the Company's performance. These measures are quarterly net income,
Real Growth, and Economic Profit, as those terms are defined above, and
appreciation in the value of 3M stock.

     In addition, the compensation paid to Mr. DeSimone is also based on
performance against nonfinancial measures. These nonfinancial measures include
upholding the Company's Statement of Corporate Values (which include customer
satisfaction through superior quality and value, attractive investor return,
ethical business conduct, respecting the environment, and fostering employee
pride in the Company), management succession planning, and the general overall
perception of the Company by financial and business leaders.


     No changes have been made to the fixed base salary portion of Mr.
DeSimone's compensation since January 1997 and no changes were made to the
variable, performance-based portion of Mr. DeSimone's compensation in 1999.
Increases in compensation over the amounts paid in 1998 were due solely to the
improved performance of the Company.

DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

     Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the Company's ability to
deduct, for federal income tax purposes, certain compensation in excess of $1
million per year paid to persons named in the Summary Compensation Table. The
Committee intends to ensure that all compensation paid to the executive officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table continues to meet the deductibility
requirements of Section 162(m) to the extent that such requirements do not
compromise the Company's ability to design effective compensation plans that
meet the Company's executive compensation objectives described above.

CONCLUSION

     The Committee is satisfied that the short-term and long-term compensation
paid to the executive officers of the Company create alignment with the
Company's strategic objectives and ensure that payouts are driven by Company
performance and employee contribution to the Company.

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

     The following compares the Company's cumulative and annualized total
shareholder return, overall stock market performance with reinvested dividends*,
during the five fiscal years preceding December 31, 1999, against the Standard &
Poor's 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, both of which are
well-known and published industry indices. The Company is included in both the
S&P 500 Stock Index and the Dow Jones Industrial group of 30 companies. The
Company, as a highly diversified manufacturer and seller of a broad line of
products, is not easily categorized with other, more specific, industry indices.

     The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on
the assumption that $100 had been invested in the Company's stock and each index
on December 31, 1994 (as required by SEC rules), and that all quarterly
dividends were reinvested at the average of the closing stock prices at the
beginning and end of the quarter. The total cumulative dollar returns shown on
the graph represents the value that such investments would have had on December
31, 1999.

     *The Company's interest in Imation Corp. was distributed to stockholders
as a special stock dividend payable in shares of Imation Corp. stock on July
15, 1996. The following graph accounts for this distribution as though it was
paid in cash and reinvested in common shares of the Company.

TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN
AND THE 3M EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trusts established in
connection with the 3M Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") and the 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan (the "VIP"). As Trustee, it is the record owner of the
shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company ("3M") held
in the ESOP and the VIP for the benefit of participants. Since the portion of
the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP") applicable to
union-free employees was merged into the ESOP during 1990, the shares of 3M
common stock held in the PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the ESOP
Trust.

The ESOP and the VIP each permit participants, as Named Fiduciaries, to direct
the respective Trustees how to vote the number of shares of 3M common stock
allocated to the participants' respective accounts. Additionally, as a Named
Fiduciary of the ESOP, you are entitled to direct the Trustee how to vote a
proportionate number of shares which have not been allocated to participants or
for which no voting directions have been received. The number of shares of 3M
common stock held in your individual accounts in the ESOP and the VIP are
indicated at the top of the enclosed proxy card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
9, 2000, and Proxy Statement (unless you have consented to receive the Proxy
Statement via the Internet in which case the Proxy Statement is available at the
website in the enclosed notice), (2) instructions for giving voting directions
to the Trustee via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail through use of the
enclosed proxy card, and (3) a return envelope. The Trustee will vote, in
accordance with your directions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your
respective accounts if you give voting directions by (i) the Internet as
described in the enclosed voting instructions, (ii) telephone as described in
the enclosed voting instructions or (iii) completing the enclosed proxy card and
returning it in the enclosed return envelope so that it is received no later
than May 5, 2000 by Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for
the Trustee.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the ESOP and VIP accounts. The ability to direct the Trustee how to vote confers
no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Internet or telephone voting instructions must be properly followed or the
enclosed proxy card must be properly completed if voting directions are to be
honored. If the Internet or telephone voting instructions are not followed or if
the card is not received by May 5, 2000, or if the voting directions are
invalid, the shares held in your ESOP accounts will be voted by State Street
Bank and Trust Company in the same proportion that the other participants in the
ESOP direct the Trustee to vote the shares held in their ESOP accounts, and the
shares held in your VIP account shall be voted by State Street Bank and Trust
Company as directed by the Public Issues Committee of the 3M Board of Directors.

Please provide voting directions to the Trustee via the Internet or by telephone
in accordance with the enclosed voting instructions, or complete, date, sign,
and promptly return the enclosed proxy card.


TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE 3M SAVINGS PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State Street Bank and Trust Company is Trustee of the Trust established in
connection with the 3M Savings Plan (the "Savings Plan"). As Trustee, it is the
record owner of the shares of common stock of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company ("3M") held in the Savings Plan for the benefit of participants. Since
the portion of the 3M Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("PAYSOP")
applicable to employees eligible to participate in the Savings Plan was merged
into the Savings Plan during 1993, the shares of 3M common stock held in the
PAYSOP Trust have now been transferred to the Savings Plan.

The Savings Plan permits participants to direct the Trustee how to vote the
number of shares of 3M common stock allocated to the participants' respective
accounts. The number of shares of 3M common stock held in your individual
account in the Savings Plan are indicated at the top of the enclosed proxy card.

We enclose (1) a Notice of Annual Meeting of 3M Stockholders to be held on May
9, 2000, and Proxy Statement (unless you have consented to receive the Proxy
Statement via the Internet in which case the Proxy Statement is available at the
website in the enclosed notice), (2) instructions for giving voting directions
to the Trustee via the Internet, by telephone, or by mail through use of the
enclosed proxy card, and (3) a return envelope. The Trustee will vote, in
accordance with your directions, the shares of 3M common stock allocated to your
account if you give voting directions by (i) the Internet as described in the
enclosed voting instructions, (ii) telephone as described in the enclosed voting
instructions or (iii) completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the
enclosed envelope so that it is received no later than May 5, 2000 by Norwest
Bank Minnesota, N.A., acting as tabulation agent for the Trustee.

The Trustee remains at all times the record owner of the 3M common stock held in
the Savings Plan accounts. The ability to direct the Trustee how to vote confers
no right on participants to vote directly at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Internet or telephone voting instructions must be properly followed or the
enclosed proxy card must be properly completed if voting directions are to be
honored. If the Internet or telephone voting instructions are not followed or if
the card is not received by May 5, 2000, or if the voting directions are
invalid, the shares held in your Savings Plan account shall be voted by State
Street Bank and Trust Company, as directed by the Public Issues Committee of the
3M Board of Directors.

Please provide voting directions to the Trustee via the Internet or by telephone
in accordance with the enclosed voting instructions, or complete, date, sign,
and promptly return the enclosed proxy card.

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE:

                       3M STOCKHOLDERS CAN CHOOSE TO VIEW
                   FUTURE ANNUAL REPORTS AND PROXY STATEMENTS
                                 ON THE INTERNET


     3M is offering stockholders of record the option to view future Annual
Reports to Stockholders and Proxy Statements via the Internet, instead of
receiving paper copies of these documents in the mail. This notice addresses a
number of questions that you may have about this option.

     Q: WHO QUALIFIES?

     A: This option is available only if you are a 3M stockholder "of record,"
(i.e., a stockholder who is registered on the books of 3M's transfer agent,
Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., as holding 3M stock directly in your own name).

     Q: HOW DO I ELECT THIS OPTION?

     A: If you are interested in viewing future Annual Reports to Stockholders
and Proxy Statements on the Internet, instead of receiving paper copies of these
documents, please do the following:

          (1)  Go to website http://www.econsent.com/mmm.

          (2)  Review Important Considerations and Frequently Asked Questions.

          (3)  You will need your account number, which can be found above your
               name and address on your dividend check stub and your social
               security number, if you have a social security number.

          (4)  Follow the prompts.

     Q: WHAT ARE THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS?

     A: To obtain the documents, you will need access to the Internet through
your personal computer. Commercial services such as America Online, MCI, AT&T
and many other Internet service providers offer access to the Internet with
Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, or other Internet search engine
software. You also will need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view and/or print the
documents. (This software is available free of charge.) Stockholders are
responsible for any charges imposed by Internet service providers; 3M does not
charge any fees for access to its website.

     Q: HOW DO I ACCESS THE WEBSITE ON THE INTERNET?

     A: When the 3M Proxy Statement and Annual Report are available on its
Internet website, 3M will mail you a notice which will include a website address
to access the documents, instructions on voting your proxy via the Internet or
by telephone, and a proxy card if you choose to vote by mail. The proxy card
that is delivered to stockholders who have elected electronic delivery will
cover shares that are directly registered with Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. in
the stockholder's name. Notification is expected to begin on or about March 31st
of each year.

     Q: HOW DO I REVOKE MY CONSENT?

     A: You can revoke your consent at the website http://www.econsent.com/mmm.
Once there, click on the Proceed button, fill in the appropriate information and
click on the Submit button. You will then see the appropriate screen to change
your consent. You will then receive paper copies of future Annual Reports to
Stockholders and Proxy Statements.
