ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 28,
1995 at the corporation's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, at the
intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy
statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or
about March 13, 1995. The corporation will bear the cost of making solicitations
from its shareholders and may enlist the help of banks and brokerage firms in
soliciting proxies from their customers. The corporation will reimburse these
institutions for out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited by mail
or in person by directors, officers, or employees of the corporation and its
subsidiaries. The corporation has also retained Georgeson & Company Inc. to aid
in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $13,000 plus
reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE

Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 1995 will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of January 31,
1995, the corporation had 801,879,751 outstanding common shares, which are the
only outstanding voting securities.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING OF PROXIES

A shareholder may vote in person, by a duly executed proxy, or through an
authorized representative. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize
no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies
may be revoked at any time prior to the meeting. This may be done by written
notice delivered to the secretary of the corporation, or by signing and
delivering a proxy with a later date.

All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected.

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

to elect the 13 nominees hereinafter named. These shares may be voted
cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than
the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee become unavailable to
serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of
directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy
holders, such action is necessary or desirable.

Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against either the
ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors or the shareholder proposal, or
has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be
voted as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted
FOR ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, and AGAINST the shareholder
proposal.

A majority of the outstanding shares, entitled to vote on a matter, represented
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of
the shareholders with respect to that matter.

A proxy may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such
proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur,
for example, when a broker or bank is not permitted to vote stock held in street
name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present
and, therefore, not entitled to vote on such matter, although these shares may
be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares
will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be
decided at the meeting.

The favorable vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and
entitled to vote on these matters are required for approval of these matters.
Abstentions and withheld votes have the effect of votes against a matter.

It is the corporation's policy that all proxies, ballots and voting tabulations
that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not
be disclosed except: (i) where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
(ii) where disclosure may be necessary in order for the corporation to assert or
defend claims, (iii) where a shareholder writes comments on his or her proxy
card, (iv) where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, (v) to allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or (vi) in limited
circumstances such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved
and recommended by the board of directors.

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots and voting
tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not employees of
the corporation.

The board of directors is not aware of any other issue to be brought before the
meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the
accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy
holders.

- --------------------------------------------------

Austen, D. A. Jones, B. Powell, Jr., A. B. Rand, W. D. Smithburg, and W. L.
Weiss, held two meetings in 1994. This committee develops general criteria
regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, and
recommends candidates for such positions to the board of directors. A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director or directly
nominate persons for director by complying with the procedures on page 15.

The board affairs committee, whose members are W. L. Weiss, chairman, K. F.
Austen, H. L. Fuller, The Lord Hayhoe PC, A. F. Jacobson, and D. A. Jones was

The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 1994
was 97 percent.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Report of the Compensation Committee

The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.

The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:

    - Integrates compensation programs with both the corporation's annual and
      long-term strategic planning and measurement processes.

    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.

    - Helps attract and retain key executives critical to the long-term success
      of the corporation.

The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.

The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies are included in the Standard and Poor's Healthcare
Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and
performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison.

Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements -- base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation -- is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.

In 1994, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.

Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively
taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining
the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases.

The Abbott Management Incentive Plan is designed to reward executives when the
corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's area
of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial
elements such as profitability, total sales, and earnings per common share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Each year individual incentive
targets are established for incentive plan participants based on competitive
survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, targets
are set to deliver total compensation between the mid and upper range of
competitive practice as warranted by corporate performance. For 1994, 40% of the
target award was earned for achievement of the corporation's earnings per common
share goal. The remainder of the targeted incentive was earned based on the
committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the
predetermined goals discussed above.

The corporation has provided forms of equity participation as a key part of its
total program for motivating and rewarding executives and managers for many
years. Grants of stock options and restricted stock

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               8

have provided an important part of the equity link to shareholders. Through
these vehicles, the corporation has encouraged its executives to obtain and hold
the corporation's stock. Targeted award ranges for stock options and restricted
stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice
among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation targets are set
based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the
target ranges are established such that equity participation opportunities will
be in the mid-to-upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
corporation and individual performance. Actual individual awards are determined
based on the established competitive target range and the committee's overall
assessment of individual performance. The committee considers the amounts of
options and restricted stock previously granted and the aggregate size of
current awards in deciding to award additional options and restricted stock.

In 1994, the committee granted Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 2.8% which was consistent with the
corporation's established merit increase program. As reflected in the
corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 1994 included 8.9%
growth in sales, and 10.7% growth in earnings per common share. In light of this
performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the committee
determined to grant Mr. Burnham a 10.3% increase in bonus and a stock option
grant.

It is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for
executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and
its stockholders in achieving the corporation's long-term business objectives.
To that end, the committee will continue to assess the impact of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and
take action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

TABLE FOOTNOTES

(1) Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted in tandem with these
    options. These rights are only exercisable for sixty days following a change
    in control of the corporation. Upon exercise, the optionee must surrender
    the related option and will receive a payment, in cash, in an amount equal
    to the difference between the option's price and the fair market value of
    the shares subject to the option.

(2) One-third of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one
    year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.

(3) The dollar amounts under these columns are the result of calculations at the
    5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and, therefore, are not intended to
    forecast possible future appreciation, if any, of the stock price.

(4) Amounts were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 1994
    of 803,279,722 and December 31, 1994 closing market price of $32.625 per
    share.

Annuity Retirement Plan

The corporation and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan
known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees
in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on
service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120
months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits.

The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis without giving effect to Social Security off-sets and include
supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan. The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named
officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 10.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. Pensions accrued under the
Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity
Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all participants in that plan.
Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present
values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts established on
behalf of the participants in that plan. During 1994, the following amounts,
less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts
established on behalf of the named officers: D. L. Burnham, $78,775; T. R.
Hodgson, $81,677; P. N. Clark, $3,284; and D. A. Thompson, $59,768. As of
December 31, 1994, the years of service credited under the Plan for the named
officers were as follows: D. L. Burnham - 12; T. R. Hodgson - 22; P. N. Clark -
10; G. P. Coughlan - 4; and D. A. Thompson - 23.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation of Directors

Employees of the corporation are not compensated for serving on the board or on
board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each
month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as chairman of a
board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee).

Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, or deferred (as a
non-funded obligation of the corporation or paid into a secular trust
established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or
upon retirement from the board of directors). If the fees are deferred, the
director may elect to have the fees credited to a stock equivalent account under
which the fees accrue the same return they would have earned if invested in
common shares of the corporation. Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees
not credited to a stock equivalent account.

Under the Plan, the corporation may grant a director who retires from the board
a retirement benefit, and such benefit will be payable to the surviving spouse
of any director who dies while serving as a director. The retirement benefit
consists of payment of an amount equal to the monthly director's fee in effect
on the date the director retires (or, for a director who dies, the fee in effect
on the date of death) for a period equal to his or her service on the board to a
maximum of 120 months. In return for the retirement benefit, the director agrees
to provide consulting services to the board.

Under the Abbott Laboratories 1991 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee
director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder
meeting receives a restricted stock award with a fair market value on the date
of the award closest to, but not exceeding, twenty thousand dollars. In 1994,
this was 698 shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination,
retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of the corporation. The
non-employee directors are entitled to vote the shares and receive all dividends
paid on the shares.

In 1994, K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services for the
corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement in the areas of research and
development, new technology and immunopharmacology. The consulting agreement,
which expires on March 31, 1998, provides that the fees he earns under the
agreement may receive the same treatment as fees earned under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. In 1994, Dr. Austen received
$50,000 for his consulting services.

The corporation believes that during 1994 its officers and directors complied
with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 except as described below. Richard Morehead, an officer of the
corporation, filed one late report. Mr. Morehead amended his 1993 Form 5 to
report that his son acquired 7 shares and his daughter acquired 6 shares in 1993
through their participation in the Abbott Laboratories Dividend Reinvestment
Plan. John Kringel, an officer of the corporation, filed three late Form 4's,
each reporting a single additional transaction. One reported a sale of 40 shares
by his son. One reported a transfer of shares from his wife's account to his
account. One reported a sale of 1,200 shares by a trust of which he is a
co-trustee.

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
(ITEM NO. 2 ON PROXY CARD)

The bylaws of the corporation provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit
committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent
public accountants to serve as auditors, and that such appointment shall be
submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board
has appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This
firm has served as auditors of the corporation since 1963. The board of
directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen
LLP as independent public accountants for 1995.

Representatives of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to
do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

A shareholder proposal is included in this proxy statement. The corporation is
advised that the proposal will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting.
The proposed resolution and statement made in support thereof are presented
below. The names and addresses of the shareholders submitting the proposal will
be furnished by the corporation to any person requesting such information. The
board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

- --------------------------------------------------

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT FORMULA
(ITEM NO. 3 ON PROXY CARD)

WHEREAS - the misuse of infant formula is a serious health problem. When formula
is mixed with impure water or inadequate amounts of formula are used in
preparation, infants often become sick and many die. In fact UNICEF's Director,
James Grant has estimated that over one million babies lives could be saved
annually if their mothers breastfed instead of bottlefed. Thus, it is vitally
important that infant formula companies do not engage in marketing or promotion
practices which undermine breast-feeding and promote formula instead. We are
pleased that our company has stated publicly that it endorses breast-feeding as
the superior form of infant nutrition and is committed to the principle that its
marketing practices do not discourage breast-feeding.

Hiroshi Nakajima, M.D., Ph.D., Director-General of the World Health Organization
(WHO) and James P. Grant, Executive Director of UNICEF urge that infant formula
companies, "within the context of legal instruments and requirements within
countries, comply with the principles of the International Code (of Marketing
for Breast-Milk Substitutes) in all countries to the fullest extent possible."

Dr. Nakajima and Mr. Grant further state that "adherence to the International
Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes in its entirety in all countries is
a minimum requirement and only one of several important actions required in
order to protect healthy practices in respect of infant and young child
feeding."

However, Abbott Ross has still not ended its practice of providing free supplies
of formula to hospitals as a marketing tool to encourage that hospital to buy
Ross formula unless forbidden to do so by government regulation. This is a clear
Code violation. In addition, Abbott continues to face other complaints that it
internationally violates the Code.

Our company also faces domestic controversy re: infant formula price fixing and
paid $140 million in settlement of a court case, and faces other cases that
could be very costly.

THEREFORE be it resolved that the shareholders request the board of directors to
endorse and implement, within any country's legal context, the International
Code of Marketing for Breast-Milk Substitutes wherever it sells infant formula.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              14

- --------------------------------------------------

PROPONENTS' STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT FORMULA

Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1981 to protect infant health from
inappropriate commercial pressures, the WHO/UNICEF Code is a reasonable standard
and minimum requirement for infant formula industry behavior.

Addressing the "universality of the Code," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, M.D.,
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), says there is NO label
such as developed or developing when it comes to promoting breast-feeding. He
says the Code has "universal relevance."

"Breast is best" means the preferred feeding for infants in all countries. There
should be no national boundaries for the best nutrition and healthiest babies.
We want Abbott to commit to following the Code wherever it does business.

We ask you to support this resolution requesting that company policy be
consistent with internationally agreed upon health care practices and the aim of
the Code "to promote and protect breast-feeding."

- --------------------------------------------------

BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT
FORMULA
(ITEM NO. 3 ON PROXY CARD)

Your board of directors opposes the shareholder proposal, and recommends that
you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Abbott believes that its marketing of infant formula is extremely responsible.
Abbott follows the WHO Code in its entirety in developing countries. Further,
Abbott has instructed its international affiliate management to eliminate free
and low cost supplies to institutions whenever government legislation has been
passed, whenever a hospital or group of hospitals request elimination of free
supplies, or whenever common business practice in a local area follows that
pattern.

Worldwide, Abbott supports breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition for
infants.

Your board of directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

- --------------------------------------------------

DATE FOR RECEIPT OF 1996 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Shareholder proposals for presentation at the 1996 Annual Meeting must be
received by the corporation no later than November 14, 1995 and must otherwise
comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for
the 1996 meeting.

- --------------------------------------------------

OTHER MATTERS

Over the course of the past year, the corporation has advanced defense costs on
behalf of a number of current and former officers and directors in connection
with ABBOTT LABORATORIES DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. This is a consolidated
shareholder derivative action instituted in May and June of 1993 against all of
the corporation's present directors (other than Allen F. Jacobson) and a former
executive officer that is pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.
The complaint seeks to hold the defendants liable for an amount exceeding $140
million, in connection with the corporation's settlement of certain antitrust
litigation arising out of its marketing of infant formula, plus additional
unspecified damages, on the ground that the defendants had a duty to prevent or
correct the conduct that gave rise to the underlying claims. In addition, on
April 29, 1994, the board of directors adopted resolutions indemnifying, to the
extent necessary, the individual defendants in connection with the settlement of
MORSE V. ABBOTT LABORATORIES, ROBERT A. SCHOELLHORN, DUANE L. BURNHAM ET. AL.
