Business Overview and Performance Highlights 





 
  



Business Overview     
              AbbVie was created in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie's mission is to be an innovation-driven, patient-focused
specialty biopharmaceutical company capable of achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative new medicines. AbbVie intends to continue to
advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) growing revenues through continued strong performance from its existing portfolio of on-market products, including its flagship brands,
HumiraTM and ImbruvicaTM, as well as growth from pipeline products; (ii) continuing to enhance efficiency by expanding operating margins; (iii) continued
investment in its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, neuroscience and virology, as well as focused investments in other areas that augment AbbVie's core strengths;
(iv) augmentation of its pipeline through concerted focus on strategic licensing, acquisition and partnering activity with a focus on identifying compelling programs that fit AbbVie's strategic
criteria; and (v) returning cash to stockholders via dividends and share repurchases.

AbbVie also Delivered Strong Business Performance in 2016     
              AbbVie has built a strong foundation for its business and 2016 was an exceptional year, as evidenced by a number of 2016 business
highlights: 


 Net Revenues:  AbbVie reported
2016 full-year net revenues of $25.6 billion on a GAAP basis and adjusted net revenues of $25.6 billion, an increase of 13.3% over 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This
reflects top-tier growth, third in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group.   
 Operating Margins:  In 2016,
AbbVie expanded its operating margin to 36.6% on a GAAP basis or 42.4% of net revenues on an adjusted basis, and reported gross margin of 77.2% on a GAAP basis or 81.2% of net revenues on an adjusted
basis. Excluding the incremental R&D investment related to acquisitions in 2016 and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, the adjusted operating margin was 45.9% in 2016.   
 Earnings Per Share:  AbbVie
reported full-year diluted EPS of $3.63 on a GAAP basis and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.82, up 12.4%. This reflects top-tier growth, third in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group. AbbVie provided 2017 GAAP
diluted EPS guidance in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 and adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $5.44 to $5.54, reflecting growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint.   
 Humira Sales:  AbbVie delivered
global Humira sales of $16.1 billion, an increase of 14.7% on a reported basis over 2015, or 16.1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Humira's performance was driven by continued market
penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies.   
 Imbruvica Net Revenue:  In 2016,
global Imbruvica net revenue exceeded $1.8 billion, with performance driven by market share growth following Imbruvica's approval as a first line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL).

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 





​
 



 Business Development:  AbbVie
acquired Stemcentrx and its lead late-stage asset, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), further strengthening AbbVie's oncology portfolio by providing a highly attractive platform in solid tumors. AbbVie
also entered into a collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a
number of immune-mediated diseases.   
 Regulatory Milestones:  AbbVie
also achieved a number of regulatory milestones in markets worldwide for several key products, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals for
several new products, including VenclextaTM for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with 17p deletion, ZinbrytaTM for relapsing forms of
multiple sclerosis and EmplicitiTM for the treatment of multiple myeloma, as well as new indications for Humira and Imbruvica.   
 Pipeline Development:  With a
record number of programs in mid- and late-stage development, AbbVie made significant pipeline advancements in 2016, such as regulatory application submissions for the company's pan-genotypic
next-generation HCV combination and Imbruvica for marginal zone lymphoma. 

  
 
     


Corporate Governance Highlights 





              Our
board of directors is committed to strong corporate governance tailored to meet the needs of AbbVie and its stockholders to enhance stockholder value. In
connection with our ongoing, proactive engagement with stockholders (as described in greater detail on page 29), AbbVie's board of directors:


approved and implemented in 2016 a proxy access by-law provision to permit a stockholder, or a
group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least 3% of the company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least 3 years to nominate and include in the company's proxy materials director
nominees constituting up to 25% of the board of directors, as further detailed in the company's By-Laws; and 
approved a declassification management proposal in this proxy statement (Item 4) to seek
stockholder approval to amend the company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the board of directors and to allow for the annual election of directors, as described in
Item 4.

Executive Compensation Highlights 





              AbbVie's
board of directors believes a well-designed compensation program should align executive interests with the drivers of stockholder returns and profitable
growth, support achievement of the company's primary business goals, and attract and retain world-class executives whose talents and contributions sustain the growth in long-term stockholder value.
Consequently, the compensation committee of the board has designed and implemented an
executive compensation program in which a substantial majority of named executive officer (NEO) compensation at AbbVie is performance-based. 
              When
determining NEO compensation, the committee first considers the median of the competitive marketplace (as derived primarily from the Health Care Peer Group approved by the
committee) as an initial benchmark for assessing compensation. The committee then takes into account the company's overall performance against the financial, operating and strategic objectives that
were established at the start of the performance period. Finally, specific pay determinations are made for each NEO based on his or her individual performance against goals and contributions to the
short- and long-term performance of the company.

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 





​
 

              Three
primary components make up AbbVie's executive pay program: base salary, short-term incentives and long-term incentives. The structure of each component is tailored to serve a
specific function and purpose. The following is a summary of the key components of our compensation program. 

















​




​


​






Element of Pay
 
Changes Made for 2016





​




​


​







Long-Term Incentive Program
 


    ü Completed redesign of our long-term incentive program:


 
 


     Added multiple
performance metrics, including relative ROE, EPS and relative TSR as criteria for vesting.


 
 


     Removed provision that
allowed performance awards to vest if thresholds were met in any 3 of 5 years, creating more risk of forfeiture.


 
 


     Added multi-year
performance periods.


 
 


     Changed dividend payment
schedule so dividends are paid only at vesting and only on earned shares.


 
 


     Increased use of
performance-vested awards from 75% to 80% which, in combination with stock options, ties 100% of our LTI program to performance metrics and stock price appreciation.


 
 


     Refined process for
referencing the market median for long-term incentive award decisions.






 Short-Term Incentive Plan
 






    ü Added disclosure of our maximum annual incentive cap of 200% of target.






 ​
 






    ü Reduced the CEO's target annual incentive to 150% of base salary.






 ​
 






    ü Established a formal payout matrix based on net revenues and operating margin to define and cap NEO annual incentive awards at or below the plan maximum.


Peer Comparisons
 


    ü Simplified the peer group used for compensation benchmarking, the AbbVie Health Care Peer Group.

Who Can Vote     
              Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2017 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of
March 8, 2017, AbbVie had 1,593,576,738 outstanding shares of common stock, which are AbbVie's only outstanding voting securities. Each stockholder has one vote per share. Stockholders do not
have the right to vote cumulatively in electing directors. 
 
  



Notice and Access     
              In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) e-proxy rules, AbbVie mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials (the "Notice") to stockholders in March 2017. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how stockholders can access the proxy materials online. It also
provides instructions on how stockholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a printed version of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you would like to
receive a printed version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
 
  



Voting by Proxy     
              AbbVie's stockholders may vote their shares by telephone, the Internet, or at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you
do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found on the Notice, on the website listed in the Notice, and, if you received one, on your proxy card. If you requested a
printed version of the proxy card, you may also vote by mail. 
 
  



Revoking a Proxy     
              You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the
meeting:


 by delivering a written notice to the secretary of AbbVie, 
 by delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
 by voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 

 
  



Discretionary Voting Authority     
              Unless otherwise specified in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares of AbbVie
common stock covered by proxies they receive to elect the 4 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. If a nominee becomes unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute
designated by the board of directors or for fewer than 4 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. 
              Where
a stockholder has specified a choice for or against the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting or if the stockholder has chosen to abstain, the shares of AbbVie common
stock represented by the proxy will be voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as
auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, FOR the management proposal regarding the annual election of directors, and AGAINST each of the stockholder proposals. 
              The
board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy
will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.

​
 







INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 





​
 
  



Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy     
              A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a
quorum. Directors are elected by stockholders in an uncontested election if a majority of the votes cast are "for" a director's re-election at the Annual Meeting, excluding abstentions and broker
non-votes. For other matters, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented, in person or by proxy, at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the stockholders
with respect to that matter, except for the management proposal regarding the annual election of directors, which requires the affirmative vote of shares representing not less than eighty percent
(80%) of the outstanding shares of capital stock of AbbVie entitled to vote generally in the election of directors pursuant to Article XI of AbbVie's Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation. 
 
  



Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions     
              A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a
portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in
the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these
shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote shares in the absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock
Exchange considers "routine," such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters.
The election of directors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, the management proposal regarding the annual election of directors, and the stockholder proposals are considered
"non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies that are present and
entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain from voting on that matter, other than the election of directors, will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
 
  



Inspectors of Election     
              The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify stockholders are independent and
are not AbbVie employees. 
 
  



Cost of Soliciting Proxies     
              AbbVie will bear the cost of making solicitations from its stockholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of AbbVie and its subsidiaries. 
              AbbVie
has retained Georgeson Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
 
  



AbbVie Savings Plan     
              Participants in the AbbVie Savings Plan will receive voting instructions for their shares of AbbVie common stock held in the AbbVie Savings
Plan Trust. The Trust is administered by both a trustee and an investment committee. The trustee is The Northern Trust Company. The members of the investment committee are William H.S. Preece, Tabetha
A. Skarbek and Michael J. Thomas, employees of AbbVie. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the investment committee and the participants. The investment committee
must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The investment committee may use its own discretion with respect to those shares of AbbVie common
stock for which no voting instructions are received.

The Board of Directors 





              The
board of directors held eleven meetings in 2016. The average attendance of all incumbent directors at board and committee meetings in 2016 was ninety-six percent
and each director attended at least seventy-five percent of the total number of board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. AbbVie encourages its board members to attend
the annual stockholder meeting. All of AbbVie's directors attended the 2016 annual stockholder meeting. 
              The
board has determined that each of the following individuals is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards: Dr. Alpern,
Ms. Austin, Mr. Burnside, Mr. Hart, Mr. Liddy, Ms. Meyer, Mr. Rapp, Mr. Tilton, and Mr. Waddell. To determine independence, the board applied
the AbbVie Inc. director independence guidelines. The board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with AbbVie or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of
these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or
entities to which AbbVie sold products or made contributions or from which AbbVie purchased products and services during the year. This also included consideration of the fact that some of the
directors serve on the board of Abbott Laboratories (Abbott), AbbVie's former parent. In making its determination, the board relied on both information provided by the directors and information
developed internally by AbbVie. 
              The
board has risk oversight responsibility for AbbVie and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. 
              The
board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of chairman of the board and chief executive officer are held by one individual and the chair of the
nominations and governance committee is appointed to be the lead director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all board decisions, including
risk oversight, and is in the best interests of AbbVie and its stockholders. The lead independent director is chosen by and from the independent members of the board of directors. 
              The
lead independent director responsibilities include: 















  1.
 









 facilitates communication with the board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions where the chairman of the board is not present;


2.
 
 reviews and approves matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other board members;






 3.
 








 serves as the liaison between the chairman of the board and the independent directors;


4.
 
 has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;






 5.
 








 if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication as needed; and


6.
 
 performs such other duties as the board may determine from time to time.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES 





​
              All
directors are encouraged to, and in fact do, consult with the chairman on each of the above topics, as well. The lead director, and each of the other directors, communicates
regularly with the chairman of the board and chief executive officer regarding appropriate agenda topics and other board related matters. 
              AbbVie
directors have backgrounds that when combined provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that serve AbbVie's governance and strategic needs. Director nominees are considered
based on a range of criteria including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business
perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship, and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the board. They must have demonstrated experience and ability that is
relevant to the board's oversight role with respect to AbbVie's business and affairs. They must also be able and willing to represent the stockholders' economic interests and satisfy their fiduciary
duties to stockholders without conflicts of interest. For more details on director qualifications, please see Exhibit A to AbbVie's Governance Guidelines. 
              Each
year, the board conducts a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. The full board discusses the evaluation reports to determine
what, if any, action should be undertaken to improve board and committee performance. 
              In
the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the board of directors, the nominations and governance committee considers the board's diversity of ethnicity, gender, and
geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. 
              Each
director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the board to conclude that the director should serve on the board. The directors' biographies
are in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Information Concerning Director Nominees." 
              The
following table highlights our directors' skills and experience. The skills identified below are considered by nominations and governance committee to be the most relevant to the
board's oversight role with respect to AbbVie's business and affairs and to drive our culture of innovation and responsibility. The specific importance of each skill also is noted. 
              Such
skills include, among others:


Healthcare IndustryRelevant to an industry understanding and review of our
business and strategy for continued innovation. 
LeadershipFor a board that can successfully advise and oversee the company's
business performance and represent stockholders interests. 
Global Business and StrategyFor oversight of a complex global organization like
AbbVie to successfully advise and oversee the strategic development and direction of the company. 
Corporate Governance and Public Company BoardEnsuring directors have background
and knowledge to perform oversight and governance roles. 
Finance or AccountingEnabling our directors to analyze our financial statements,
oversee our capital structure, and consider financial transactions. 
Government Relations and RegulatoryFor an understanding of the complex regulatory
and governmental environment in which our business operates.

independence, and

​
performance,
the performance of AbbVie's internal audit function and internal auditors, certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and enterprise risk management. Each of the members of the
audit committee is financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the NYSE, and the independence requirements set forth in Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The board of directors has determined that Ms. Austin, the committee's chairperson, is an "audit committee financial expert." 
 
  



Compensation Committee     
              The compensation committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in carrying out the board's
responsibilities relating to the compensation of AbbVie's executive officers and directors. The compensation committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the directors and gives its
recommendations to the full board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending
director compensation, the compensation committee takes into account director fees paid by companies in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect
director compensation. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this
proxy statement. The committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which the AbbVie executive officers participate and all of AbbVie's equity-based plans. It
may delegate the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulations or
with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The compensation committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain and/or terminate independent advisors who may assist the
committee in carrying out its responsibilities. The compensation committee reviews and discusses with management and its independent compensation advisor potential risks associated with AbbVie's
compensation policies and practices as discussed in the "Compensation Risk Assessment" section of this proxy statement. Each member of the committee qualifies as a "non-employee director" for purposes
of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and as an "outside director" for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). 
              The
committee has engaged Compensation Advisory Partners (CAP) as its independent compensation consultant. The independent compensation consultant provides counsel and advice to the
committee on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. CAP, and its principal, report directly to the chair of the committee. The principal meets regularly, and as needed, with the
committee in executive sessions, and has direct access to the committee chair during and between meetings. The committee determines what variables it will instruct CAP to consider, including: peer
groups against which performance and pay should be examined, metrics to be used in incentive plans to assess AbbVie's performance, competitive short- and long-term incentive practices in the
marketplace, and compensation levels relative
to market benchmarks. The committee negotiates and approves all fees paid to CAP for these services. AbbVie did not engage CAP to perform any other services during 2016. 
              Based
on an assessment of internally developed information and information provided by CAP, the committee has determined that its independent compensation advisor does not have a
conflict of interest. A copy of the compensation committee report is included in the "Compensation Committee Report" section of this proxy statement. 
 
  



Nominations and Governance Committee     
              The nominations and governance committee is governed by a written charter. This committee assists the board of directors in identifying
individuals qualified to become board members and recommends to the board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders, recommends to the board the persons to be
elected as executive officers of AbbVie, recommends to the board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to AbbVie, oversees the evaluation of the board and management, and serves in an
advisory capacity to the board and the chairman of the board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major changes in the organizational structure of AbbVie, and the conduct of board
activities. The process used by this committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the board of directors depends on the qualities being sought, as described on pages 14-15. From time
to time, AbbVie engages an executive search firm to assist the committee in identifying individuals qualified to be board members.

the responsibilities set forth in its charter. 
 
  



Executive Committee     
              The executive committee members are Mr. Gonzalez, chair, Ms. Austin, Mr. Liddy, Mr. Rapp, and Mr. Tilton.

(1)Under
the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan as in effect until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, non-employee directors earned $10,500 for each month of
service as a director and $1,000 for each month of service as a chair of a board committee, other than the chair of the audit committee. The chair of the audit committee received $1,500 for each month
of service as a chair of that committee and the other members of the audit committee received $500 for each month of service as a committee member. The Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan was amended in
2016 to adjust certain components of the program based on recommendations of the compensation committee's independent compensation consultant following review of AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group market
practices and trends. Under the amended Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan, effective as of the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, non-employee directors earn $105,000 per year for service as a
director and $20,000 per year for service as a chair of a board committee, other than the chair of the audit committee. The chair of the audit committee receives $25,000 per year for service as chair
of that committee and the other members of the audit committee receive $500 for each month of service as a committee member. The non-employee director and committee fees are earned monthly for each
calendar month or portion thereof that the director holds the position, excluding the month in which the director is first elected to the position.  

Fees
earned under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan are, at the director's election, paid in cash, delivered in the form of vested non-qualified stock options (based on an independent
appraisal of their fair value),

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 





​


deferred
until retirement (as an unfunded AbbVie obligation), or paid currently into an individual grantor trust established by an eligible director. The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held
in a director's grantor trust generally commences at the later of when the director reaches age 65 or upon retirement from the board of directors. Fees deposited in a trust may be credited to a stock
equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in AbbVie stock or to a guaranteed interest account. If necessary, AbbVie contributes funds to a director's trust so that as
of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related AbbVie common stock at year end.  


(2)The
amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted during 2016, determined in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. AbbVie determines the grant date fair value of the awards by multiplying the number of units granted by
the average of the high and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. 

In
addition to the fees described in footnote (1), each non-employee director elected to or serving on the board of directors at the 2016 annual stockholder meeting received under the AbbVie 2013
Incentive Stock Program vested restricted stock units with a target grant date value of $185,000. In 2016, this equated to 2,974 restricted stock units (after rounding the award down to the nearest
whole unit), with a reportable value of $184,983. The non-employee directors receive cash payments equal to the dividends paid on the shares covered by the units at the same rate as other
stockholders, but do not otherwise have access to the restricted stock units during their board service. Upon termination or retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of the company, a
non-employee director will receive one common share for each restricted stock unit outstanding under the Incentive Stock Program. 
The
following AbbVie restricted stock units were outstanding as of December 31, 2016: R. Alpern, 19,019; R. Austin, 26,682; W. Burnside, 10,460; B. Hart, 2,974; E. Liddy, 14,446;
E. Rapp, 10,460; G. Tilton, 22,666; F. Waddell, 10,460. These numbers include, where applicable, AbbVie restricted stock units issued with respect to Abbott Laboratories restricted stock units
outstanding when AbbVie separated from Abbott on January 1, 2013.  


(3)No
AbbVie stock options were outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
(4)The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan during 2016.
(5)Charitable
contributions made by AbbVie's non-employee directors are eligible for a matching contribution (up to $25,000 annually). For 2016 contributions, the
AbbVie Foundation made charitable matching contributions on behalf of the following AbbVie directors: R. Alpern, $25,000; W. Burnside, $25,000; B. Hart, $25,000; E. Liddy, $5,000;

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 





​
  

I.    Executive Summary     
  



Compensation Philosophy     
              At AbbVie, the board of directors and management believe a well-designed compensation program should align executive interests with the drivers
of stockholder returns and profitable growth, support achievement of the company's primary business goals, and attract and retain world-class executives whose talents and contributions sustain the
growth in long-term stockholder value. The board believes it has implemented a compensation program that appropriately balances short- and long-term strategic objectives and directly links
compensation to stockholder value with more than three-fourths of the total direct compensation paid to NEOs tied to performance. 
  



Business Overview     
              AbbVie was created in 2013 following separation from Abbott Laboratories. AbbVie's products are focused on treating conditions such as chronic
autoimmune diseases in rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology; oncology, including blood cancers; virology, including hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus; neurological
disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis; metabolic diseases, including thyroid disease and complications associated with cystic fibrosis; as well as other serious health
conditions. 
              Our
pipeline includes more than 50 compounds or indications in development across important medical specialties such as immunology, virology, oncology and neuroscience, with additional
targeted investment in cystic fibrosis and women's health.

Net revenues, diluted earnings per share and operating margin are adjusted to exclude certain specified items and are non-GAAP numbers, which are reconciled in Appendix B.
 
 




              AbbVie
has delivered a strong compound annual growth rate (CAGR) since inception on adjusted net revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), placing AbbVie in the top
quartile of its Health Care Peer Group. Additionally, AbbVie has been committed to a robust return of capital to stockholders with an increase of 60% in its dividend since 2013 as part of a balanced
and disciplined capital allocation program. AbbVie's total stockholder return (TSR) since inception of 111.4% also places AbbVie among the top of its Health Care Peer Group, and more than
40 percentage points above the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and more than 65 percentage points above the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index over the same time period.

AbbVie also Delivered Strong Business Performance in 2016     
              AbbVie has built a strong foundation for its business and 2016 was an exceptional year, as evidenced by a number of 2016 business
highlights: 


 Net Revenues:  AbbVie reported
2016 full-year net revenues of $25.6 billion on a GAAP basis and adjusted net revenues of $25.6 billion, an increase of 13.3% over 2015, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. This
reflects top-tier growth, third in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group.   
 Operating Margins:  In 2016,
AbbVie expanded its operating margin to 36.6% on a GAAP basis or 42.4% of net revenues on an adjusted basis, and reported gross margin of 77.2% on a GAAP basis or 81.2% of net revenues on an adjusted
basis. Excluding the incremental R&D investment related to acquisitions in 2016 and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, the adjusted operating margin was 45.9% in 2016.   
 Earnings Per Share:  AbbVie
reported full-year diluted EPS of $3.63 on a GAAP basis and adjusted diluted EPS of $4.82, up 12.4%. This reflects top-tier growth, third in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group. AbbVie provided 2017 GAAP
diluted EPS guidance in the range of $4.55 to $4.65 and adjusted diluted EPS guidance in the range of $5.44 to $5.54, reflecting growth of nearly 14% at the midpoint.   
 Humira Sales:  AbbVie delivered
global Humira sales of $16.1 billion, an increase of 14.7% on a reported basis over 2015, or 16.1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Humira's performance was driven by continued market
penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies.   
 Imbruvica Net Revenue:  In 2016,
global Imbruvica net revenue exceeded $1.8 billion, with performance driven by market share growth following Imbruvica's approval as a first line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL).   
 Business Development:  AbbVie
acquired Stemcentrx and its lead late-stage asset, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), further strengthening AbbVie's oncology portfolio by providing a highly attractive platform in solid tumors. AbbVie
also entered into a collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a
number of immune-mediated diseases.   
 Regulatory Milestones:  AbbVie
also achieved a number of regulatory milestones in markets worldwide for several key products, including U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approvals for
several new products, including VenclextaTM for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with 17p deletion, ZinbrytaTM for relapsing forms of
multiple sclerosis and EmplicitiTM for the treatment of multiple myeloma, as well as new indications for Humira and Imbruvica.   
 Pipeline Development:  With a
record number of programs in mid- and late-stage development, AbbVie made significant pipeline advancements in 2016, such as regulatory application submissions for the company's pan-genotypic
next-generation HCV combination and Imbruvica for marginal zone lymphoma.

Total Stockholder Return (TSR) Performance     
              Over the four years since AbbVie's separation from Abbott, we have delivered a total stockholder return of 111.4%, which places us among the
top of our Health Care Peers and surpasses the cumulative total returns of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index, as shown in the graph below. The graph covers
the period from January 2, 2013 (the first day AbbVie's common stock began "regular-way" trading on the NYSE) through December 31, 2016. The graph assumes $100 was invested in AbbVie
common stock and each index on January 2, 2013 and also assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The stock price performance in the following graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock
price performance. 
 
  Comparison of Cumulative Total Return since AbbVie's Launch     



  



AbbVie is Positioned for Future Growth     
              AbbVie is well-positioned to deliver strong top- and bottom-line performance through 2020 and beyond. The company has established growth
platforms in some of the largest and most attractive market segments, including immunology, oncology, virology and neurology, and has built a compelling pipeline in these areas which will contribute
significantly to future performance. AbbVie is committed to top-line growth and operating margin expansion. In October 2015, AbbVie outlined its long-term strategic and financial objectives through
2020, including an expectation to deliver annual double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average, company net revenues of approximately $37 billion in 2020, and an adjusted operating margin profile
of greater than 50 percent in 2020.

Components of our Compensation Program     
              The compensation committee of the board oversees our executive compensation program, which includes several compensation elements that have
each been tailored to incentivize and reward specific aspects of company performance the board believes are central to delivering long-term stockholder value. Key components of our compensation
program are listed below. 



              In response to stockholder feedback, we redesigned our long-term incentive (LTI) program for 2016, emphasizing multiple, relative performance metrics and
multi-year performance periods (see page 36 for a detailed description of the 2016 redesign).
              The
committee is dedicated to ensuring that a substantial portion of executive compensation is "at-risk" and variable. Generally, more than three-fourths of our NEOs' total direct
compensation is variable and directly affected by both the company's and the NEO's performance. 
 
  



2016 Performance Results     
              The performance targets established under our annual and long-term incentive plans are rigorous and calibrated to a range of potential
outcomes, with above target payouts for strong performance and below target payouts (including no payout) for below target performance. Targets are based on expected business, market and regulatory
conditions, including expectations for our pipeline. The financial goals shown in the following table were carried by all of the NEOs as part of their 2016 performance goals. The specific weightings
for each NEO, other than the CEO, are established at the start of each performance year based on the NEO's role and anticipated contributions to the company's annual objectives. Financial goals are
set rigorously; achievement of these targets has resulted in top-tier industry performance.

Stockholder Engagement     
 
  



2016 Say on Pay Results     
              At our 2016 Annual Meeting, the say on pay proposal received support from 94% of our stockholders. The board and compensation committee are
encouraged by the continued, consistent stockholder support for our executive compensation program. 
              AbbVie
is committed to regular, ongoing engagement with stockholders to ensure that we continue to understand stockholder feedback about our compensation program and incorporate that
feedback into the compensation decision-making process. To that end, in 2016 AbbVie approached and engaged stockholders holding approximately 38% of the company's outstanding shares. In these
discussions, the aggregate feedback was generally supportive of the compensation program, consistent with the level of stockholder support for our say on pay proposals in the last two

​
years,
and was not prescriptive about our compensation plan design. The feedback informs the compensation committee's continuous assessment of the program design and ongoing discussions with
stockholders, which contribute to the evolution of the program. 
              After
considering stockholder feedback and suggestions, AbbVie's compensation committee, in consultation with management and the committee's independent compensation consultant, has
proactively reviewed our policies and compensation program design. For annual awards beginning in 2016, our LTI program has been redesigned, as discussed in greater detail in the following section. 
 
  



Executive Compensation Program Updates in 2016     
              The compensation committee of the board has engaged in a continuous process of evaluation and enhancement of the AbbVie executive compensation
program. Since the company's launch, AbbVie has made significant enhancements to its legacy compensation programs, the most recent of which are described in the following paragraphs and on
page 36. 
              The
committee has considered the feedback from stockholders as to the design of its compensation program and competitive benchmarking and, in 2016, completed a comprehensive revision of
the program. The new long-term incentive program was effective for equity grants made in 2016. The program consists of equity awards that include 40% performance shares, 40% performance-vested
restricted stock awards and 20% stock options. Vesting may occur over a 3-year period based on relative return on equity (ROE) for the performance-vested restricted stock awards and earnings per share
(EPS) (with a relative 3-year total stockholder return (TSR) modifier) for the performance shares. The 2016 program eliminates vesting in any 3 of 5 years and provides that awards may vest only
over 3 years based on the achievement of the defined performance metrics. Additionally, dividends will not be paid unless the performance criteria are met, and then will be paid only on shares
that are earned. AbbVie believes the new design further strengthens and aligns the performance orientation of senior executive compensation. Highlights of the changes made for 2016 include:

​


​







Long-Term Incentive Program
 


    ü Completed redesign of our long-term incentive program:


 
 


     Added multiple
performance metrics, including relative ROE, EPS and relative TSR as criteria for vesting.


 
 


     Removed provision that
allowed performance awards to vest if thresholds were met in any 3 of 5 years, creating more risk of forfeiture.


 
 


     Added multi-year
performance periods.


 
 


     Changed dividend payment
schedule so dividends are paid only at vesting and only on earned shares.


 
 


     Increased use of
performance-vested awards from 75% to 80% which, in combination with stock options, ties 100% of our LTI program to performance metrics and stock price appreciation.


 
 


     Refined process for
referencing the market median for long-term incentive award decisions.






 Short-Term Incentive Plan
 






    ü Added disclosure of our maximum annual incentive cap of 200% of target.






 ​
 






    ü Reduced the CEO's target annual incentive to 150% of base salary.






 ​
 






    ü Established a formal payout matrix based on net revenues and operating margin to define and cap NEO annual incentive awards at or below the plan maximum.


Peer Comparisons
 


    ü Simplified the peer group used for compensation benchmarking, the AbbVie Health Care Peer Group.

II.    Executive Compensation Process     
 
  



Commitment to Performance-Based Awards     
              More than three-fourths of AbbVie's NEO pay is performance-based. Specific goals and targets are the foundation of our pay-for-performance
process, and this section describes how they apply to each pay component. Though quantitative metrics such as financial and operational results are a central part of our performance assessment, some
goals such as leadership and progress against strategic and long-term objectives are difficult to measure using numeric or formulaic criteria. As such, the compensation committee also conducts a
qualitative assessment of individual performance to ensure the overall assessment of performance and pay decisions are aligned with the company's true performance over a period of time. A discussion
of the decision-making criteria for each pay component follows. 
 
  



Committee Process for Setting Total Compensation     
              Each February, the committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant and AbbVie's management team, determines target
pay levels for NEOs. The process starts with a consideration of compensation levels and the mix of compensation for comparable executives at companies in AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group, which are
listed below in the section captioned "Compensation Benchmarking." After this benchmark review, the committee establishes NEO compensationbase salary adjustments, annual incentive awards,
and long-term
incentive awardsrelative to the peer median in each instance. Awards can be differentiated from the peer group median based on each NEO's individual performance, leadership, and
contributions to long-term strategic performance.

​
 
  



Compensation Benchmarking     
              To provide the appropriate context for executive pay decisions, the committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant,
assesses the compensation practices and pay levels of AbbVie's Health Care Peer Group. The committee chooses to focus on the Health Care Peer Group because its constituents share important
characteristics with AbbVie, particularly the global emphasis on research-based pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceutical therapies and the regulatory environment within which they operate. Members of the
Health Care Peer Group are AbbVie's primary competitors for executive talent and are companies the committee believes chiefly represent our competitive market:

Eli Lilly and Company






 Gilead Sciences, Inc.


GlaxoSmithKline plc






 Johnson & Johnson


Merck & Company, Inc.






 Novartis AG


Pfizer Inc. 





​




​


​







 
  



Role of the Compensation Consultant     
              The compensation committee has engaged Compensation Advisory Partners as its independent compensation consultant. The committee's independent
consultant reports directly to the chair of the committee. The consultant meets regularly, and as needed, with the committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the chair during and between
meetings, and performs no other services for AbbVie or its senior executives. The committee determines what variables it will instruct its consultant to consider, which include: peer groups against
which performance and pay should be examined, metrics to be used to assess AbbVie's performance, competitive incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market
benchmarks. 
 
  



Compensation Risk Oversight     
              The company has established, and the compensation committee endorses, several controls to address and mitigate compensation-related risk, such
as employing a diverse set of performance metrics, maintaining robust stock ownership guidelines for its executives and non-employee directors, and retaining broad discretion to recover incentive
awards in the unlikely event that incentive plan award decisions are based on earnings that are subsequently restated. The committee identified no material risks in AbbVie's compensation programs in
2016.

​
 
  

III.    Compensation Plan Elements     
              Three primary components make up AbbVie's executive pay program: (1) base salary, (2) short-term incentives and
(3) long-term incentives. The structure of each component is tailored to serve a specific function and purpose. 











CEO Pay Mix
 
 All Other NEO Average Pay Mix





 







 
  



Base Salary     
              The compensation committee sets appropriate levels of base salary to ensure that AbbVie can attract and retain a leadership team that will
continue to meet our commitments to customers and patients and sustain long-term profitable growth for our stockholders. Generally, the committee considers the median of the Health Care Peer Group as
an initial benchmark, but also references additional information as needed. Specific pay rates are then established for each NEO relative to his or her market benchmark based on the NEO's performance,
experience, unique skills, internal equity with others at AbbVie, and the company's operating budget. 
 
  



Short-Term Incentives     
 
  



Performance Incentive Plan     
              Annual cash incentives are paid to NEOs through AbbVie's Performance Incentive Plan (PIP), which rewards executives for achieving key financial
and non-financial goals that are measured at the company and individual levels. The PIP is intended to comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for performance-based
compensation. The compensation committee may define and cap PIP awards below the maximum amounts allowed by IRC Section 162(m), and is guided by the use of a formal annual incentive payout
matrix that establishes a potential range of final incentive outcomes based on net revenues and operating margin performance. All NEOs carry a target incentive amount set as a percentage of their base
salary. Mr. Gonzalez's target is 150% of base salary and the other NEOs' targets are 110% of base salary. Determining award amounts is a multi-step process. First, financial and individual
goals are evaluated and scored, resulting in a preliminary award amount of up to 100% of target only. For 2016, all financial and strategic goals were materially achieved, resulting in performance
scores between 99% and 100% of target. Final awards above 100% of target are determined at the February meeting based on company performance (the extent to which performance exceeds targets), the
recommendation of the CEO (for NEOs other than himself), and the support

​
of
the compensation committee. To determine final awards, the CEO and the compensation committee use the payout matrix to define and cap the range in making its final determinations. This process is
more fully described below: 
 
 
  Illustration of 2016 Incentive Calculation     



              While
the compensation committee relies heavily on objective, quantitative metrics to determine PIP awards, the performance review also includes a qualitative element to ensure the
review is comprehensive and inclusive of all individual, strategic, and leadership goals for which assessment is not solely dictated by numeric or formulaic applications. Moreover, while each
participant has predetermined goals, the committee also considers relative achievements and/or developments in the company, the marketplace, and the global economy that could not have been foreseen
when individual goals were established. 
              For
2016, net revenue performance was 99% compared to plan, while operating margin performance was 101% compared to plan. As a result of this performance, the annual incentive payout
matrix capped the annual incentives at 150% of target, below the plan maximum of 200% of target and the Code Section 162(m) cap. This resulted in final awards between 134% and 150% of target,
consistent with the high level of performance achieved in 2016 and within the outcome range suggested by the payout matrix. 
 
  



Annual Metrics and Goal Assessment     
              AbbVie's PIP structure is intended to align NEOs' interests directly with AbbVie's annual operating strategies, financial goals, and leadership
behaviors. In doing so, it provides a direct link between the NEOs' short-term incentives and the company's and the NEOs' annual performance results through measurable financial and operational
performance and qualitative assessments of clearly defined strategic progress and leadership behaviors. The compensation committee approves pre-established goals at the beginning of each year. The
qualitative assessment
reflects NEOs' overall leadership, progress on strategic initiatives, advancement of the pipeline, and enhancement of AbbVie's biopharmaceutical culture. 
              The
financial and strategic/leadership goals and their respective weightings are summarized in the chart below. The specific goals and weightings for each NEO, other than the CEO, are
established at the start of each performance year based on the NEO's role and anticipated contributions to the company's annual objectives. The CEO's goals are similarly established at the start of
each performance year; however, to reflect the CEO's overall accountability for

Long-Term Incentives     
              AbbVie redesigned its LTI program effective with the 2016 annual grant, based in part on feedback from stockholders. The new design increases
the alignment of AbbVie's long-term incentive compensation with key operational and financial initiatives, including sustained EPS growth and generation of superior investment returns relative to
peers. In 2016, NEOs received LTI awards with the following characteristics as compared to the 2015 LTI awards: 
 
 
  Evolution of Long-Term Incentive Program     





Performance Shares (40% of total LTI award)These awards have the potential to vest
at 0% to 250% of target after a three-year performance period and are earned based on company performance in earnings per share (EPS) and relative total stockholder return (TSR). TSR performance is
measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends on
performance shares accrue during the performance period and are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. 
Performance-Vested Restricted Stock (40% of total LTI award)These awards have the
potential to vest at 0% to 150% of target, in one-third increments during a three-year performance term based on AbbVie's return on equity articulated as pre-set goals and measured relative to a group
made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and
are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. 
Non-Qualified Stock Options (20% of total LTI award)These awards have the
potential to vest in one-third increments on each of the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment with the company. The option exercise price is set at or
above fair market value on the grant date. To the extent that the options vest, the award expires ten years after the grant date.

              AbbVie's
policy with respect to its annual equity award for all eligible employees, including the NEOs, is to grant the award and set the grant price at the compensation committee's
regularly scheduled February meeting each year. These meeting dates generally are the third Thursday of February and are scheduled two years in advance. The grant price is the average of the highest
and lowest trading prices of a common share on the date of the grant (rounded up to the next even penny). The grant price for the 2016 annual grant was $54.86. The high, low and closing prices of an
AbbVie common share on the grant date (February 18, 2016) were $55.53, $54.17, and $54.55, respectively. All LTI awards are subject to a minimum vesting period of 12 months. 
 
  



Benefits     
              Benefits are an important part of retention and capital preservation for all employees, helping to protect against the impact of unexpected
catastrophic loss of health and/or earnings potential, as well as providing a means to save and accumulate for retirement or other post-employment needs. 
              Each
of the benefits described below supports the company's objective of providing a market competitive total rewards program. Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions
regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that all benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive, as previously discussed. 
 
  



Retirement Benefits     
              All eligible U.S. employees, including NEOs, participate in the AbbVie Pension Plan, the company's principal qualified defined benefit plan.
NEOs and certain other employees also participate in the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Pension
Benefits." 
              The
Supplemental Pension Plan is a non-qualified defined benefit plan that cannot be secured in a manner similar to a qualified plan, for which assets are held in trust, so eligible
NEOs receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in the present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Eligible NEOs have the option of depositing the annual payment into an
individually established grantor trust, net of tax withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the NEO's actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate
trust funding (currently 8 percent). Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are not tax-deferred and the NEOs personally pay the taxes on those amounts without gross-ups. 
              The
manner in which the grantor trust assets are to be distributed to an NEO upon retirement from the company generally follows the distribution method elected by the NEO under the
AbbVie Pension Plan. If an NEO (or the NEO's surviving spouse, depending on the pension distribution method elected by the NEO under the AbbVie Pension Plan) lives beyond the actuarial life expectancy
age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit, and therefore exhausts the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid to the NEO (or his or her surviving spouse) by
AbbVie.

​
 
  



Savings Plans     
              All U.S. employees, including NEOs, are eligible to defer a portion of their annual base salary under the AbbVie Savings Plan, the company's
principal qualified defined contribution plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Eligible NEOs also may defer up to 18 percent of their base salary, less contributions to the AbbVie Savings
Plan, to the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan, which is a non-qualified defined contribution plan. Eligible NEOs may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in
cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are credited annually with earnings. Amounts deposited in the individual
trusts are not tax-deferred and the NEOs personally pay the taxes on those amounts without gross-ups. 
              NEOs
elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the company. These arrangements are described
in greater detail in this proxy statement beginning with the section captioned "Summary Compensation Table." 
 
  



Financial Planning     
              NEOs are paid an annual stipend of $10,000 for estate planning advice, tax preparation and general financial planning fees. The stipend is
income to the NEO, who is responsible for payment of all resulting taxes without gross-ups. 
 
  



Company-Provided Transportation     
              NEOs are eligible for transportation perquisites that are designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their work, including the use
of a company-leased vehicle and access to company-provided air travel, as appropriate. In some circumstances, these benefits may be used for personal travel, which would then be considered
part of the NEO's total compensation and treated as taxable income to them under applicable tax laws. The NEOs pay the taxes on such income without gross-ups. 
 
  



Disability Benefits     
              In addition to AbbVie's standard disability benefits, NEOs are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is described on
page 53 of this proxy statement. 
 
  



Employment Agreements     
              AbbVie does not have employment agreements with any of its NEOs. 
 
  



Excise Tax Gross-ups     
              AbbVie does not provide excise tax gross-ups on NEO compensation. 
 
  



Change in Control Agreements     
              AbbVie has entered into change in control agreements with its NEOs to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and
dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the company, and to protect the earned benefits of the NEOs against potential adverse changes resulting from a
change in control. 
              The
change in control agreements contain a double-trigger feature, meaning that if the NEO's employment is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability, or if the NEO elects
to terminate employment for good reason, within two
years following a change in control, he or she is entitled to receive certain pay and benefits as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or
Change in Control."

IV.    Other Matters     
 
  



Stock Ownership Guidelines     
              AbbVie's stock ownership guidelines are designed to further promote sustained stockholder return and to ensure the company's senior executives
remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives. Each senior executive has five years from the date of election or appointment to his or her position to achieve the ownership level associated
with his or her position. NEOs are not allowed to sell stock, except for tax withholding at vesting or exercise, if they do not satisfy the minimum stock ownership requirement. The minimum stock
ownership guidelines for the CEO and other NEOs are as follows:

              In
addition, AbbVie's non-employee directors are required to own AbbVie stock valued at five times (5x) the annual fee for service as a director under the AbbVie Non-Employee Directors'
Fee Plan within five years of joining the Board or as soon as practicable thereafter. 
 
  



Clawback Policy     
              While the committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award
decisions were based would occur, the committee, in evaluating such circumstances, has broad discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of stockholders up to and including
actions to recover such incentive awards. 
 
  



Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies     
              AbbVie has a formal policy that prohibits directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs,
from entering into or engaging in the purchase or sale of financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of AbbVie equity securities they hold. AbbVie also
has a
formal policy that prohibits directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all of the NEOs, from pledging AbbVie common stock as collateral for a loan. 
              In
addition, the AbbVie Incentive Stock Program provides that no long-term incentive award may be assigned, alienated, sold or transferred other than by will or by the laws of descent
and distribution or as permitted by the compensation committee for estate planning purposes, and no award and no right under any award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered. All
members of senior management, including the company's NEOs and certain other employees, are required to clear any transaction involving company stock with the General Counsel prior to entering into
such transaction. 
  
 
     


Compensation Committee Report 





              The
compensation committee of the board of directors is primarily responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing AbbVie's compensation plans and practices, and
works with management and the committee's independent compensation consultant to establish AbbVie's executive compensation philosophy and programs. The committee reviewed and discussed the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

​
  
 
     


Compensation Risk Assessment 





              During
2016, in collaboration with the compensation committee's independent compensation consultant, AbbVie conducted an in-depth risk assessment of its compensation
policies and practices, including those related to executive compensation programs for NEOs. The risk assessment included a quantitative and qualitative analysis of AbbVie's executive compensation
programs and broader employee incentive compensation plans. AbbVie also considered how these programs compare, from a design perspective, to programs maintained by other companies. Based on this
assessment, it was determined that AbbVie's executive compensation programs are balanced and appropriately incent employees, and any risks arising from the compensation policies and practices are not
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on AbbVie. The following factors were among those considered in making this determination:


 AbbVie's compensation structure contributes to a corporate culture that encourages our NEOs to regard AbbVie as a long-term employer. For
example, equity awards vest over multi-year periods, which encourages NEOs to consider the long-term impact of their decisions and align their interests with those of AbbVie's stockholders.  
 AbbVie's annual incentive program is based on multiple performance measures, balancing earnings achievement with other factors. Since earnings
are a key component of stock price performance, this aspect of AbbVie's compensation plan also promotes alignment with stockholder interests. 
 AbbVie does not include certain pay design features that may have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, such as: over-weighting
toward annual incentives, highly leveraged payout curves, unreasonable thresholds or dramatic changes in payout opportunity at certain performance levels that may encourage inappropriate short-term
business decisions to meet payout thresholds. In addition, a limit of 200% of target applies to any awards made under the NEO short-term incentive plan. 
 AbbVie's long-term incentive program focuses NEOs on longer-term operating performance and aligns NEOs with stockholder interests through the
use of multi-year performance periods and multiple performance measures, including relative total stockholder return. In 2016, AbbVie's NEOs received roughly two-thirds of their total direct
compensation in the form of long-term incentives (20% of which are stock options that may vest over a three-year period and 80% of which are performance-based awards that may vest over a three-year
performance period). 
 AbbVie makes equity awards and sets grant prices at the same time each year, at the compensation committee's regularly scheduled meeting in
February. In addition, AbbVie does not award discounted stock options or immediately vesting equity awards. 
 AbbVie has robust stock ownership guidelines for its senior executives, which promotes alignment with stockholder interests, and other good
governance equity practices such as anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies. 
 AbbVie's compensation committee has the ability to exercise downward discretion in determining annual incentive plan payouts.  
 AbbVie's compensation committee has broad discretion to claw back incentive compensation that was awarded based on financials that were later
restated. The committee can reduce or cancel incentive compensation in connection with a violation of company policy or similar misconduct. 
 AbbVie requires mandatory training on its code of conduct and policies and procedures to educate its employees on appropriate behaviors and the
consequences of taking inappropriate actions. 

              The
risk assessment results were presented to the compensation committee by its independent compensation consultant.

(1)The
year-over-year difference in base salary from 2014 to 2015 is a function of the number of pay periods in each year. There were 27 pay periods in 2014 and 26 pay
periods in 2015 and 2016.
(2)In
accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards determined
in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. AbbVie determines the grant date fair value of stock awards by multiplying the number
of shares granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date.
(3)In
accordance with SEC rules, the amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
718.
(4)These
amounts were determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. These amounts are being reported solely for the purpose
of comparative disclosure in accordance with the SEC rules. There is no certainty that the amount determined using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model would be the value at which employee
stock options would be traded for cash. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted in 2016, along with the weighted-average grant date fair value,
are shown below:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 





​


(5)The
compensation reported in this column for 2016 was earned as a performance-based incentive award pursuant to the AbbVie Performance Incentive Plan. Additional
information regarding the plan can be found in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Plan Elements."
(6)The
amounts shown below are reported in this column for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as applicable.
AbbVie Pension Plan
R.
Gonzalez: $(70,521) / $45,413 / $142,324; W. Chase: $74,428 / $(20,261) / $148,641; L. Schumacher: $86,510 / $(11,019) / $166,274; H. Gosebruch:
$15,980; and M. Severino: $22,663 / $15,872 / $18,610.
AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan
R.
Gonzalez: $3,016,444 / $2,230,380 / $4,794,683; W. Chase: $1,463,791 / $676,623 / $1,500,464; L. Schumacher: $1,093,415 / $218,282 / $2,072,222; H.
Gosebruch: $174,737; and M. Severino: $306,868 / $196,191 / $170,007.
The
changes in pension value result primarily from the following factors: (i) the effect of changes in the actuarial assumptions AbbVie uses to
calculate plan liability for financial reporting purposes; (ii) additional pension benefit accrual under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan; and (iii) the impact of the
time value of money on the pension value.
Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan Earnings
The
totals in this column include reportable interest credited under the AbbVie Performance Incentive Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan.
R.
Gonzalez: $286,608 / $171,523 / $107,802; W. Chase: $159,013 / $83,019 / $61,667; L. Schumacher: $447,761 / $297,150 / $227,423; and M. Severino:
$45,549 / $16,536 / $294.
(7)The
amounts shown in this column include the change in pension value during the applicable year, which is attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions (primarily
discount rate and mortality tables) and other factors based on plan design (primarily pay, service and age).
The
present value of a pension benefit is determined, in part, by the discount rate used for accounting purposes. The discount rate is determined by
reference to the prevailing market rate of interest. In 2016, interest rates decreased and the discount rates used for the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan were decreased to reflect that
change. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of participants' pension benefits while actual payments to be made to participants are not changed. The discount rate used for 2016
was 4.67% for the Pension Plan and 4.59% for the Supplemental Pension Plan. The discount rate used for 2015 was 4.93% for the Pension Plan and 4.83% for the Supplemental Pension Plan, while the
discount rate used for 2014 for both the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan was 4.45%. The mortality assumptions that apply for actuarial purposes also affect pension values. During 2014,
the Society of Actuaries released new mortality tables reflecting longer life expectancies, which are now in use for Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan accounting. This increase in assumed
life expectancy resulted in an increase in the present value of participants' pension benefits in 2014. During 2015, the Society of Actuaries released an improved scale that adjusted the previously
released 2014 scale, which AbbVie determined was appropriate to use in determining the funded status as of December 31, 2015.
In
addition to the effect of the changes in actuarial assumptions, other factors built into the plans contributed to the change in pension value. The
change in pension value numbers reflect the application of the benefit formulas under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan, which are described in the section of this proxy statement
captioned "Pension Benefits." As participants' pay changes, the formulas yield revised pension values. Furthermore, as a participant ages and service credit accumulates year over year (before the
participant is eligible for unreduced pension benefits), the present value of his or her pension benefits increases, even without changes in pay or actuarial assumptions.
(8)The
amounts shown below are reported in this column for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, as applicable.
Earnings for Non-Qualified Defined Benefit and Non-Qualified Defined Contribution
Plans
R.
Gonzalez: $149,512 / $120,030 / $94,209; W. Chase: $84,680 / $75,830 / $50,968; L. Schumacher: $310,138 / $280,224 / $302,097; and M. Severino:
$20,104 / $437 / $0.
Each
of the NEOs' awards under the AbbVie Performance Incentive Plan is paid in cash to the NEO on a current basis and, for eligible NEOs, may be
deposited into a grantor trust established by the NEO, net of maximum tax withholdings. Each of the eligible NEOs has also established grantor trusts in connection with the AbbVie

Supplemental
Pension Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan. These amounts include the earnings (net of the reportable interest included in footnote (6)).  


Employer Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans
R.
Gonzalez: $80,000 / $79,423 / $79,798; W. Chase: $48,968 / $47,519 / $46,186; L. Schumacher: $48,968 / $47,577 / $47,879; H. Gosebruch: $13,250; and
M. Severino: $48,048 / $45,904 / $25,188.
These
amounts include AbbVie contributions to the AbbVie Savings Plan and the AbbVie Supplemental Savings Plan, as applicable. The Supplemental Savings
Plan permits eligible NEOs to contribute amounts in excess of the annual limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions to 401(k) plans up to the excess of
(i) 18 percent of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to AbbVie's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. AbbVie matches participant contributions at the rate of
250 percent of the first 2 percent of compensation contributed to the plan. The eligible NEOs have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor
trust established by the NEO, net of maximum tax withholdings.
Other 2016 Compensation
The
totals shown in the table include the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the NEO: R. Gonzalez: $19,362; W. Chase:
$18,645; L. Schumacher: $20,856; H. Gosebruch: $16,634; and M. Severino: $23,378. AbbVie imputes income to the NEO, if required, and the NEO pays taxes in accordance with tax regulations
without gross-ups.
The
totals shown in the table include a $10,000 financial planning services allowance for each NEO. AbbVie imputes income to the NEO, if required, and
the NEO pays taxes in accordance with tax regulations without gross-ups.
The
totals shown in the table include the following costs for non-business-related air travel: R. Gonzalez: $535,834; W. Chase: $112; and L. Schumacher:
$4,536. AbbVie determines the incremental cost for flights based on the direct cost to AbbVie, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees, catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous
direct costs. AbbVie imputes income to the NEO, if required, and the NEO pays taxes in accordance with tax regulations without gross-ups.
For
Mr. Gonzalez, the total includes $64,508 for costs associated with security, determined based on AbbVie's actual costs for such services. The
security was provided on the recommendation of an independent security study. AbbVie imputes income to Mr. Gonzalez, if required, and he pays taxes in accordance with tax regulations without
gross-ups.
For
Mr. Gosebruch, the total includes $103,581 for relocation costs.
The
NEOs also are eligible to participate in an executive disability benefit which is described on page 53 of this proxy statement.
(9)These
amounts were paid to replace prior employer incentive awards.

(1)During
2016, each of the NEOs participated in the AbbVie Performance Incentive Plan. The annual cash incentive award earned by the NEO in 2016 under the plan is
shown in the Summary Compensation Table in the column captioned "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." No future pay-outs will be made with respect to the 2016 awards under the plan. The plan is
described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisCompensation Plan ElementsShort-Term Incentives."
(2)This
is a performance share award that has the potential to vest at 0% to 250% of target during a three-year performance period and is earned based on company
performance in earnings per share (EPS) and relative total stockholder return (TSR). TSR performance is measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P
Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid in cash at vesting only to the extent that shares are
earned. In 2016, in connection with the phase-in of the redesigned long-term incentive program, AbbVie's EPS performance resulted in the vesting on February 28, 2017 of two-thirds of the award
at 166.7% of target, and the remaining one-third of the award has been banked for vesting to be determined based on the company's relative TSR performance following the three-year performance period
that ends December 31, 2018. The performance metrics are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisCompensation Plan
ElementsLong-Term Incentives."
(3)This
is a performance-vested restricted stock unit award that has the potential to vest at 0% to 150% of target, in one-third increments, during a three-year
performance term based on AbbVie's return on equity (ROE) articulated as pre-set goals and measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical,
Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid in cash at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. In
2016, AbbVie's relative ROE performance resulted in the vesting on February 28, 2017 of one-third of the award at 150% of target. The performance metrics are described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned "Compensation Discussion and AnalysisCompensation Plan ElementsLong-Term Incentives."

(4)The
grant date fair value of stock awards is determined by multiplying the number of shares or units granted by the average of the high and low market prices of one
share of AbbVie common stock on the award grant date. In the event of a grantee's death or disability, these awards will be deemed earned either based on actual performance through the date of death
or disability or at target, depending on the timing of the death or disability, as set forth in the award agreement. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described
in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards."
(5)One-third
of the shares of common stock covered by these options are exercisable after one year, two-thirds after two years, and all after three years. The options
vest in the event of the grantee's death or disability. Upon a change in control, the treatment of these awards is determined as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Potential
Payments upon Termination or Change in ControlEquity Awards." Under the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program, these options have an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low
market prices (rounded up to the next even penny) of one share of AbbVie common stock on the date of grant. These options do not contain a replacement option feature.
(6)The
grant date fair value of option awards is determined as of the option grant date using a Black-Scholes stock option valuation model. The assumptions used to
determine the grant date fair value are described in footnote (4) to the Summary Compensation Table.

(1)Three
of AbbVie's NEOs were employed by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) prior to AbbVie's separation from Abbott on January 1, 2013 (the "Separation"). When
AbbVie separated from Abbott, outstanding Abbott equity awards generally converted into adjusted awards based on Abbott common shares and AbbVie common stock (except to the extent prohibited by local
law or with respect to certain awards described below). Such awards are subject to substantially the same terms, vesting conditions and other restrictions that applied to the original Abbott awards
immediately before the Separation.
Each
Abbott stock option was converted into an adjusted Abbott stock option and an AbbVie stock option, with adjustments to the stock option exercise
prices that were intended to preserve the value of the original Abbott award as measured immediately before and immediately after the Separation. Each such adjusted Abbott stock option and AbbVie
stock option is subject to substantially the same terms, vesting conditions, post-termination exercise rules and other restrictions that applied to the original Abbott stock option immediately before
the Separation.

(a)These
are shares of performance-vested restricted stock that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016, from an award made on February 20,
2014. The award has a 5-year term, with no more than one-third of the original award vesting in any one year upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity target, measured at the end of the
relevant year. In 2016, AbbVie reached its minimum return on equity target and the unvested shares vested on February 28, 2017.
(b)These
are shares of performance-vested restricted stock that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016, from an award made on February 19,
2015. The award has a 5-year term, with no more than one-third of the original award vesting in any one year upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity target, measured at the end of the
relevant year. In 2016, AbbVie reached its minimum return on equity target and one-half of the unvested shares vested on February 28, 2017.
(c)These
are performance shares that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016 from an award made on February 18, 2016. The award has the
potential to vest at 0% to 250% of target during a 3-year performance period and is earned based on company performance in earnings per share (EPS) and relative total stockholder return (TSR). TSR
performance is measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index.
Dividends accrue during the performance period and are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. In 2016, in connection with the phase-in of the redesigned long-term incentive

program,
AbbVie's EPS performance resulted in the vesting on February 28, 2017 of two-thirds of the award at 166.7% of target, and the remainder of the award has been banked for vesting to be
determined based on the company's relative TSR performance following the 3-year performance period that ends December 31, 2018.  


(d)These
are performance-vested restricted stock units that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016, from an award made on February 18,
2016. The award has the potential to vest at 0% to 150% of target, in one-third increments, during a 3-year performance term based on AbbVie's return on equity (ROE) articulated as pre-set goals and
measured relative to a group made up of companies that are constituents in either the S&P Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Life Science Index or the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index. Dividends accrue during
the performance period and are paid at vesting only to the extent that shares are earned. In 2016, AbbVie's relative ROE performance resulted in the vesting on February 28, 2017 of one-third of
the award at 150% of target.
(e)These
are shares of performance-vested restricted stock that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016, from an award made on December 9,
2015. The award has a 5-year term, with no more than one-third of the original award vesting in any one year upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity target, measured at the end of the
relevant year. In 2016, AbbVie reached its minimum return on equity target and one-half of the unvested shares will vest on December 9, 2017.
(f)These
are shares of performance-vested restricted stock that remained outstanding and unvested on December 31, 2016, from an award made on June 2,
2014. The award has a 5-year term, with no more than one-third of the original award vesting in any one year upon AbbVie achieving a minimum return on equity target, measured at the end of the
relevant year. In 2016, AbbVie reached its minimum return on equity target and the unvested shares will vest on June 2, 2017.

Pension Benefits 





              During
2016, the NEOs participated in two AbbVie-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the AbbVie Pension Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the AbbVie
Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature AbbVie uses to attract senior executives who are mid-career hires,
which provides an additional benefit to such participants that is less valuable to participants who have spent most of their career at the company. Except as provided in AbbVie's change in control
agreements, AbbVie does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. The change in control agreements are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned
"Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
              The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the NEOs is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary
Compensation Table.

Pension Plan     
              The Pension Plan is a broad-based plan that covers most AbbVie employees in the United States, age 21 or older, and provides participants with
a life annuity benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  


A.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service after 2003.
B.1.65%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004 (up to 20); plus 1.50% of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by
years of benefit service prior to 2004 in excess of 20 (but no more than 15 additional years); less 0.50% of the lesser of 3-year final average earnings (but not more than the social security wage
base in any year) or the social security covered compensation level multiplied by years of benefit service.
C.1.10%
of 5-year final average earnings multiplied by years of benefit service prior to 2004. 

              The
benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on
age and employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
              Final
average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Pension
Plan covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
              Participants
become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Employees hired
after 2003 who terminate employment prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Employees
hired before 2004 who terminate employment prior to age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Employees
hired before 2004 who terminate employment prior to age 50 with fewer than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
              The
Pension Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of
these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
              Employees
who retire from AbbVie prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at
age 55 with 10 years of service. Employees hired before 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit
service total 70 or more. Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Schumacher are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
              The
subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires
after reaching age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age
55, the benefit is actuarially reduced from age 65.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 





​              The
early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at
retirement:


 In general, the 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit are reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are
made before age 62 and the 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62.  
 Employees who participated in the plan before age 36 may elect "Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55 with age
plus Seniority Service points of at least 94 or "Early Special Retirement" on the last day of any month after reaching age 55, provided their age plus Seniority Service points would reach at least 94
before age 65. Seniority Service includes periods of employment prior to attaining the minimum age required to participate in the plan. If Special Retirement or Early Special Retirement applies,
Seniority Service is used in place of benefit service in the formulas. The 5-year final average earnings portions of the benefit in B above are reduced 12/3 percent for each year
between ages 59 and 62 plus 21/2 percent for each year between ages 55 and 59. The 3-year final average earnings portion of the benefit is reduced 5 percent per
year for each year that payments are made before age 62. Benefit C is payable on an unreduced basis at Special Retirement and is reduced 3 percent per year for each year that payments are made
before age 62, if Early Special Retirement applies. 

 
  



Supplemental Pension Plan     
              The provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan (which covers AbbVie employees in the United States whose compensation exceeds certain limits
under the Internal Revenue Code) are substantially the same as those of the Pension Plan, with the following exceptions:


 Participants' 5-year final average earnings are calculated using the average of the 5 highest years of base earnings and the 5 highest years of
payments under AbbVie's non-equity incentive plans. 
 The Pension Plan does not include amounts deferred or payments received under the AbbVie Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of a
participant's final average earnings. To preserve the pension benefits of Deferred Compensation Plan participants, the Supplemental Pension Plan includes amounts deferred by a participant under the
Deferred Compensation Plan in its calculation of final average earnings. 
 In addition to the benefits outlined above for the Pension Plan, the NEOs are eligible for an additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefit
equal to 0.6% of 5-year final average earnings for each year of service for each of the first 20 years of service occurring after the participant attains age 35. The benefit is further limited
by the maximum percentage allowed under the Pension Plan under that plan's benefit formulas (A, B and C above). The portion of this additional benefit attributable to service before 2004 is reduced
3 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 60. The portion attributable to service after 2003 is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made
before age 60 if the participant is at least age 55 at early retirement. If the participant is under age 55 at retirement, the portion attributable to service after 2003 is actuarially reduced from
age 65. 
 The Supplemental Pension Plan provides early retirement benefits similar to those provided under the Pension Plan. The benefits provided to
NEOs under the Supplemental Pension Plan are not, however, reduced for the period between age 60 and age 62, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65.
Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Schumacher are eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
 Vested benefits accrued under the Supplemental Pension Plan may be funded through a grantor trust established by an eligible NEO. Consistent
with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, those NEOs who became officers prior to 2009 may have the entire amount of their vested plan
benefits funded through a grantor trust. Eligible NEOs who became officers after 2008 and before 2015 may have only the vested benefits that accrue following the calendar year in which he or she is
first elected as an officer funded through a grantor trust.

              Benefits
payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Pension Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The

(1)AbbVie
calculates these present values using: (i) a discount rate of 4.67% for the Pension Plan and a discount rate of 4.59% for the Supplemental Pension
Plan, the same discount rates it uses for Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 715 calculations for financial reporting purposes; and
(ii) each plan's unreduced retirement age, which is age 62 under the AbbVie Pension Plan and age 60 under the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan for those participants who are eligible for early
retirement benefits and which is age 65 under both plans for other participants. The present values shown in the table reflect postretirement mortality, based on the FASB ASC Topic 715
assumption (the RP2006 Healthy Annuitant table projected fully generationally with MP2016 mortality improvement scale), but do not include a factor for preretirement termination, mortality, or
disability.
(2)During
2016, the amounts shown, less applicable tax withholdings, were distributed and deposited into the individual grantor trusts established by the eligible NEOs
and included in the NEOs' income, as applicable. Consistent with the distribution requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and its regulations, vested Supplemental Pension Plan
benefits, to the extent not previously funded, are distributed to the eligible participants' individual grantor trusts and included in their income. Amounts held in an eligible NEO's individual trust
are expected to offset AbbVie's obligations to him or her under the plan. Grantor trusts are described in greater detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned "Compensation Plan
ElementsBenefitsRetirement Benefits."

(1)Mr. Chase's
and Ms. Schumacher's contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan ceased in 2007 and 2002, respectively.
(2)The
plan permits participants to defer up to 75% of their base salary and up to 75% of their annual cash incentives and credits a participant's account with an
amount equal to the employer matching contributions that otherwise would have been made for the participant under AbbVie's tax-qualified defined contribution plan. Participants may direct the
investment of their deferral accounts into one or more of several funds chosen by the administrator, and the deferral account is credited with investment returns based on the performance of the
fund(s) selected. During 2016, the weighted average rate of return credited to the accounts was 8.1% for Mr. Chase and 8.8% for Ms. Schumacher.  

The
plan provides for cash distributions in either a lump sum or installments after separation from service and permits in-service withdrawals in accordance with specific procedures. Participants make
distribution elections each year that apply to the deferrals to be made in the following calendar year, in accordance with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Participants
may request withdrawals due to financial hardship; if a hardship withdrawal is approved, it is limited to the amount needed to address the hardship.  


(3)The
amounts reported in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.
(4)The
amounts reported in this column have not been previously reported as compensation in AbbVie's Summary Compensation Tables because they relate to contributions
made before the applicable individual became an NEO.  

  
 
     


Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 





 
  



Potential Payments upon TerminationGenerally     
              AbbVie does not have employment agreements with its NEOs. 
              The
following summarizes the payments that the NEOs would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2016. Earnings would have continued to be paid for the
NEO's Performance Incentive Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan grantor trusts, as applicable, until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the period
over which the trust assets were distributed and the trust earnings and fees. If the trust assets were distributed over a 10-year period and based on current earnings, the NEOs would receive the
following average annual payments over such 10-year period: Mr. Gonzalez, $410,784; Mr. Chase, $249,683; Ms. Schumacher, $594,974; and Dr. Severino, $85,551. In addition,
the following one-time deposits would have been made under the AbbVie Supplemental Pension Plan for each of the following NEOs, respectively: Mr. Gonzalez, $1,253,903; Mr. Chase,
$713,187; and Ms. Schumacher, $834,337. As of December 31, 2016, Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Schumacher were eligible to retire, and therefore were eligible to receive the pension
benefits previously described.

​

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 





​
              If
the termination of employment had been due to disability, then the NEOs also would have received, in addition to AbbVie's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability
benefit in the amount of $180,000 for Mr. Gonzalez; $81,300 for Mr. Chase; $81,300 for Ms. Schumacher; $66,357 for Mr. Gosebruch; and $79,800 for Dr. Severino. This
long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the NEO retires, recovers, dies or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
              If
the NEO's employment had terminated due to death or disability, his or her unvested stock options and restricted stock or unit awards would have vested on December 31, 2016
with values as set forth below in the subsection of this proxy statement captioned "Equity Awards." 
 
  



Potential Payments upon Change in Control     
              AbbVie has entered into change in control agreements with its NEOs. Each change in control agreement continues in effect until
December 31, 2018, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the
scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each
agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
              The
agreements provide that if the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the employee elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below)
within two years following a change in control, he or she is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times his or her annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for
this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period
and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years or, in the case of the
unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the employee is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the employee elects to terminate
employment for good reason during a potential change in control (see below), he or she is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that
the amount of the bonus to which the employee is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control
event" (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A), the employee will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during
the potential change in control and the bonus amounts that
would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the employee's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the employee in the preceding three years. 
              Bonus
payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The employee also will receive up to two years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits,
outplacement services and tax and financial counseling) and the value of three more years of pension accruals. If change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax
imposed under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, payments under the agreement will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the employee in a better
after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under AbbVie's incentive stock programs can be terminated and
generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. 
              For
purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of AbbVie securities representing 20 percent
or more of the outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from AbbVie and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the board of directors whose appointment was
approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving AbbVie. A "potential change in control" under
the agreements includes, among other things, AbbVie's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the
employee's position, duties, or authority; the company's failure to pay the employee's compensation or a reduction in the employee's base pay or

​
benefits;
or the relocation of the company's principal executive offices to a location that is more than 35 miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
              If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2016, immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Chase,
Ms. Schumacher, Mr. Gosebruch, and Dr. Severino would have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control
agreements:


 Mr. Gonzalez: cash termination payments$10,012,616; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits$1,741,749;
welfare and fringe benefits$67,068. 
 Mr. Chase: cash termination payments$6,905,640; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits$573,953; welfare
and fringe benefits$67,982. 
 Ms. Schumacher: cash termination payments$7,095,640; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits$3,957,291;
welfare and fringe benefits$53,963. 
 Mr. Gosebruch: cash termination payments$5,758,560; welfare and fringe benefits$48,240.  
 Dr. Severino: cash termination payments$6,559,830; additional Supplemental Pension Plan benefits$683,693;
welfare and fringe benefits$67,372. 

              The
amounts shown for Mr. Gonzalez's cash termination payments and additional supplemental pension plan benefits reflect reductions of $4,563,384 and $793,825, respectively,
which would have applied under cutback provisions in the agreement as described above. 
 
  



Equity Awards     
              The AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program was approved by AbbVie's stockholders and covers approximately 8,500 participants, including a broad
group of management and professional staff. 
              The
AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program provides that any unvested equity awards granted in or after February 2013 may be assumed, converted or replaced on an equivalent basis by the
surviving company upon a change in control. If the surviving company does not do so, the vesting of the awards is accelerated. If the surviving company does assume, convert or replace the awards on an
equivalent basis, then accelerated vesting of the awards is limited to circumstances in which, during the period from six months before through two years after a change in control, the grantee's
employment is terminated without cause or the grantee resigns for good reason. The terms "cause" and "good reason" have the same definitions as in the change in control agreements. 
              If
a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2016 and the surviving company did not assume, convert or replace any of the awards granted after January 2013, or the NEO's
employment had terminated without cause or he or she had resigned for good reason, as described above, then the unvested equity awards of the NEOs would have vested as
follows:


 Mr. Gonzalez would have vested in (i) 567,040 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $3,845,343, (ii) 164,713
shares of AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $10,314,328, (iii) 99,517 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $6,231,755, and (iv) 142,166 AbbVie performance shares with a
value of $8,902,435. 
 Mr. Chase would have vested in (i) 200,159 unvested AbbVie stock options with a value of $1,362,714, (ii) 55,283 shares of
AbbVie restricted stock with a value of $3,461,821, (iii) 37,205 AbbVie restricted stock units with a value of $2,329,777, and (iv) 53,150 AbbVie performance shares with a value of

              The
value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of one share of common stock on December 30, 2016 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied
by the number of unvested stock options held by the NEO. The value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of shares or units
that would vest as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the applicable equity award agreement terms and the closing price of one share of common stock on December 30, 2016.

              The audit committee of the board of directors is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent
registered
public accounting firm retained to audit the company's financial statements. On October 13, 2016, the audit committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to perform independent audit
services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Ernst & Young LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2013. In conjunction with the
periodic mandated rotation of the audit firm's lead engagement partner, the chair of the audit committee would be involved in the selection of a new lead engagement partner. Further, the audit
committee will periodically consider whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
              Although
the audit committee has sole authority to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, it would like to know the opinion of the stockholders regarding its
appointment of Ernst & Young LLP for 2017. For this reason, stockholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst &
Young LLP for 2017, the audit committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. The audit committee and the board
believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the company and its
stockholders. 
              Representatives
of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They
will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
              The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as AbbVie's independent registered public
accounting firm for 2017.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 





              The
audit committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent registered public
accounting firm and its related affiliates. 
              Prior
to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed permissible services expected to be
rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
              Prior
to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public
accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the
independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific pre-approval before
engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
              The
audit committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the audit
committee at its next scheduled meeting.

AUDIT INFORMATION

Audit Committee Report 





              Management
is responsible for the preparation and integrity of AbbVie's consolidated financial statements. The independent registered public accounting firm is
responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the board of directors. In this context, the audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial
statements contained in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K with AbbVie's management and its independent registered public accounting firm. 
              The
audit committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees. 
              The
audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent
registered public accounting firm the firm's independence. The audit committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the
independent registered public accounting firm. 
              Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in AbbVie's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

              Stockholders are being asked to approve the compensation of AbbVie's named executive officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission
rules,
including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material included in this proxy statement. 
              The
independent compensation committee of the board of directors, with the counsel of its independent compensation consultant, has thoroughly examined AbbVie's programs, the company's
performance related to our industry and peer group, and market factors. The committee has determined that the specific pay decisions for the named executive officers are appropriate given the
company's performance, the executives' contributions, and our stockholders' interests. 
              While
this vote is advisory and non-binding, the board of directors and the compensation committee value the opinion of the stockholders and will review the voting results and take them
into account when future compensation decisions are made. 
              Accordingly, the board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named executive officers' compensation.

              Currently, AbbVie's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") provides for a classified board of
directors divided
into three classes of directors, with each class elected for three-year terms. 
              After
considering the advantages and disadvantages of declassification, including through an open dialogue with our stockholders, the board has determined it is in the best interests of
the company and its stockholders to amend the company's Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws") to declassify the board. This will result in a fully
declassified board by the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
              The
proposed amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation would eliminate the classification of the board over a three-year period beginning at the 2018 Annual Meeting with directors
elected to a one-year term following the expiration of the directors' existing terms and provide for the annual election of all directors beginning at the 2020 Annual Meeting. The proposed amendment
to the Certificate of Incorporation would become effective upon the filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which the company would file promptly
following the 2017 Annual Meeting if our stockholders approve the amendment. The proposed amendment would not change the present number of directors or the board's authority to change that number and
to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships. 
              Delaware
law provides, unless otherwise addressed in the certificate of incorporation, that members of a board that is classified may be removed only for cause. The proposed amendment
would provide that once the AbbVie board is fully declassified as of the 2020 Annual Meeting, directors may be removed with or without cause. 
              The
proposed Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation is attached to this proxy statement as  Appendix A. The affirmative vote of the holders of 80 percent of the
outstanding shares of stock entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors on the Record Date is required to approve this proposal pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation. If our stockholders approve the proposed amendment to
the Certificate of Incorporation, the board will make certain conforming changes to the company's By-Laws. 
              The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR the management proposal to amend the Certificate of Incorporation to declassify the board of directors for
annual elections.

Stockholder Proposal on Lobbying Report (Item 5 on Proxy Card) 





              Zevin
Asset Management, on behalf of William Creighton, and co-filer UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust have notified AbbVie that it intends to present the following
proposal at the Annual Meeting and that they collectively own 797,026 AbbVie shares. 
              Whereas, we believe in full disclosure of AbbVie's direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether AbbVie's
lobbying is consistent with AbbVie's expressed goals and in the best interests of stockholders. 
              Resolved, the stockholders of AbbVie request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 


1.Company
policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.  2.Payments
by AbbVie used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment
and the recipient.  3.AbbVie's
membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.  4.Description
of management's decision making process and the Board's oversight for making payments described in section 2 above. 

              For
purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation,
(b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. "Indirect
lobbying" is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which AbbVie is a member. 
              Both
"direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. 
              The
report shall be presented to the Audit Committee or other relevant oversight committees and posted directly on AbbVie's website. 
              Supporting Statement
              As
stockholders, we encourage transparency and accountability in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. AbbVie spent $11.4 million in 2015 and 2016
on direct federal lobbying activities (opensecrets.org). This figure does not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states. AbbVie lobbies at

the
state level but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, AbbVie spent $798,829 on lobbying in California in 2015 and 2016. 
              AbbVie
is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, which spent over $79 million lobbying in 2016 and has spent over $1.2 billion on lobbying since 1998. AbbVie is also a
member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the Business Roundtable, which together spent over $52 million on lobbying in 2015 and 2016. AbbVie's membership
in PhRMA has attracted press scrutiny ("Generics Giant Teva Join PhRMA? AbbVie, Others Aren't Having It," FiercePharma, July 5, 2016). 
              Investors
are concerned that AbbVie does not disclose total state and federal lobbying expenditures nor the portion of its trade association payments used for lobbying. More transparent
reporting would reveal whether company assets are being used for objectives contrary to AbbVie's long-term interests. For example, AbbVie supports smoking cessation, yet the Chamber has worked to
block global antismoking laws and advance the tobacco industry's domestic priorities ("U.S. Chamber Works Globally to Fight Antismoking Measures," New York
Times, June 30, 2015; "Big Tobacco's Staunch Friend in Washington: U.S. Chamber of Commerce," New York Times,
October 9, 2015). 
  
 
     


Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal on Lobbying Report (Item 5 on Proxy Card) 





              The
Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal. This proposal is unnecessary, because
AbbVie already makes extensive disclosures regarding our lobbying and political activities as required by law and we voluntarily disclose additional related information on our website, as outlined
below. AbbVie has already demonstrated transparency with respect to lobbying activities and strong risk mitigation procedures governing such activities. The preparation and maintenance of an
additional report, as proposed, is neither a good use of resources, nor would it increase stockholder value. 
The Board, through its Public Policy Committee, exercises oversight of AbbVie's political and lobbying activities.


 The Board of Directors Public Policy Committee exercises oversight of AbbVie's political expenditures and lobbying activities, as specifically
enumerated in the Committee's charter, and further governed by the Committee's approved policy on political contributions. The Public Policy Committee and AbbVie's senior management review these
activities and expenditures on a regular basis. 
 Our Executive Vice President, External Affairs, who reports directly to the CEO, and our Vice President, Government Affairs, each review and
approve all plans for corporate political contributions and lobbying at the recommendation of AbbVie's Government Affairs function to ensure that these activities are consistent with the company's
guidelines and comply with applicable laws. 
 We believe this approach, as explained on our website, minimizes risk and reflects our guiding commitment to transparency, stewardship of
corporate and stockholder funds, sound corporate practice, and high standards of ethical conduct. 

AbbVie already makes extensive disclosures regarding lobbying and political activities and has been recognized by a leading organization for transparency in this
area.


 Since our launch as a new public company in 2013, AbbVie has provided robust transparency through the disclosures described below. AbbVie's
website describes our oversight process and our guiding principles for lobbying and political activities. We pursue activities that shape policies to benefit patients, with a focus on improving
patient access to new therapeutic advances. 
 AbbVie files quarterly reports that include (i) total federal lobbying expenditures, (ii) the name of the legislation or subject
matter covered, (iii) individuals who lobbied on behalf of AbbVie, and (iv) identification

of
the legislative body or executive branch that was contacted, in compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act. These reports include expenses associated with lobbying the federal government and the
portion of trade association dues associated with federal lobbying. AbbVie provides links to these reports on our website at http://www.abbvie.com/responsibility/transparency-policies/home.html#cpc.
We file similar publicly-available lobbying reports with state and local agencies as required by law. 


 In 2016, AbbVie enhanced our website with a comprehensive list of our state lobbying reports with direct links to our state filings or the
relevant database. 
 AbbVie also provides a listing of corporate contributions to political candidates, political parties, political committees, ballot measure
committees, and organizations operating under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. These reports are updated every six months and are archived for reference on our website identified
above. 
 AbbVie does not currently make direct expenditures toward U.S. federal or state grassroots lobbying communications to the general public and
does not currently contribute funds intended for use in elections to tax-exempt organizations under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code, as disclosed on our website. If such a
contribution were made, it would be enumerated in AbbVie's reports on other corporate political contributions. 
 AbbVie discloses trade associations to which AbbVie provides $50,000 or more in annual membership, which are reviewed by the Public Policy
Committee. This threshold was lowered in 2016 from $100,000. AbbVie also posts a list of global trade associations in which an AbbVie employee serves on the organization's board of directors. Both of
these lists are available on our website. AbbVie chooses to participate as a member of various associations based on our commitment to voice our concerns as appropriate through our colleagues who
serve on the boards and committees of these groups. Such participation does not imply that we always agree with the positions of the larger organization and/or other members.  
 AbbVie also provides a link to the Federal Election Commission reports of the AbbVie Political Action Committee ("PAC"), which detail the PAC's
political contributions and expenditures. 
 In part due to the extensive disclosures described above, AbbVie is listed in the first tier of companies providing the highest level of
political transparency and accountability in the 2016 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Accountability and Disclosure as we have been for the past three years.  
 Attempting to quantify indirect lobbying would be difficult to estimate and potentially misleading to stockholders as AbbVie is not directing
the lobbying activities of trade, civic or patient groups. Further, it would be difficult for us to determine which third parties may endorse model legislation and whether such activities fall within
the proposal's request. 

              In
summary, our robust oversight mechanisms and extensive disclosures address the concerns underlying the proposal, but without the unnecessary business risks and additional resources
the proposal would introduce if implemented. 
              The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Stockholder Proposal to Separate Chair and CEO (Item 6 on Proxy Card) 





              The
Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes has notified AbbVie that it intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that the proponent owns
38 AbbVie shares. 
              RESOLVED:    The shareholders request the Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend the bylaws
as necessary, to require the Chair of the Board
of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. This policy would be phased in for the next CEO transition. 
              If
the Board determines that a Chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a
reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chair. 
              Supporting Statement:
              We
believe:


 The role of the CEO and management is to run the company. 
 The role of the Board of Directors is to provide independent oversight of management and the CEO. 
 There is a potential conflict of interest for a CEO to be her/his own overseer as Chair while managing the business. 

              AbbVie's
CEO Richard A. Gonzalez serves both as CEO and Chair of the Company's Board of Directors. We believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a
corporation's governance structure, which can harm shareholder value. 
              As
Andrew Grove, Intel's former chair, stated, "The separation of the two jobs goes to the heart of the conception of a corporation. Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an
employee? If he's an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the Board. The Chairman runs the Board. How can the CEO be his own boss?" 
              In
our view, shareholders are best served by an independent Board Chair who can provide a balance of power between the CEO and the Board empowering strong Board leadership. The primary
duty of a Board of Directors is to oversee the management of a company on behalf of shareholders. We believe a combined CEO / Chair creates a potential conflict of interest, resulting in excessive
management influence on the Board and weaker oversight of management. 
              Numerous
institutional investors recommend separation of these two roles. For example, California's Retirement System CaiPERS' Principles & Guidelines encourage separation, even
with a lead director in place. 
              According
to ISS "2015 Board Practices", (April 2015), 53% of S&P 1,500 firms separate these two positions and the number of companies separating these roles is growing. 
              Chairing
and overseeing the Board is a time intensive responsibility. A separate Chair also frees the CEO to manage the company and build effective business strategies. 
              Many
companies have separate and/or independent Chairs. An independent Chair is the prevailing practice in the United Kingdom and is an increasing trend in the U.S. 
              Shareholder
resolutions urging separation of CEO and Chair received approximately 33% in 2015 and 31% in 2016, an indication of strong investor support. 
              To
simplify the transition, this policy would be phased in and implemented when the next CEO is chosen.

Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal to Separate Chair and CEO (Item 6 on Proxy Card) 





              The
Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST this proposal. 
Our Board of Directors believes that our stockholders are best served by preserving the flexibility to determine the appropriate leadership structure for the company in light
of the circumstances at the time.
              The
proposal would unnecessarily restrict the Board's ability to determine the leadership structure best suited to AbbVie and our stockholders and would not allow the Board to consider
the specific circumstances and needs of AbbVie at a particular time. 
              Our
Board carefully considers the independence of its directors and committees, the availability of an engaged strong lead independent director, the strategic plan, and the leadership
of the CEO. It is important that our Board continue to be able to assess these relevant factors, in fulfillment of its fiduciary duty, to determine the leadership structure best suited to meet the
needs of AbbVie. Further, our Board is committed to periodically reviewing the Board's leadership structure. 
AbbVie's existing leadership structure and corporate governance practices provide strong independent oversight.
              AbbVie
has a robust lead independent director role. The lead independent director is chosen by and from the independent members of the full Board of Directors and has significant
authority and responsibilities to ensure meaningful independent leadership of the Board. Among other duties, our lead independent director:


 facilitates communication with the Board and presides over regularly conducted executive sessions of the independent directors or sessions
where the chairman of the Board is not present; 
 reviews and approves matters, such as agenda items, schedule sufficiency, and, where appropriate, information provided to other Board members;  
 serves as the liaison between the chairman of the Board and the independent directors; 
 has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; 
 if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication as needed; and  
 performs such other duties as the Board may determine from time to time. 

              All
directors, other than the CEO, are independent. All key committees and committee chairs are comprised completely of independent directors. Our independent directors meet regularly
in executive session, which is presided over by the lead director, as set forth in our Governance Guidelines available on our website. Our directors are subject to majority voting as set forth in our
By-Laws. 
The Board carefully considers AbbVie's leadership structure and has determined that the existing leadership structure best serves the needs of the company and its stockholders
at this time.
              In
light of the lead independent director authority and responsibilities and other corporate governance practices outlined above, the Board has determined that its current leadership
structure, in which the offices of chairman of the Board and chief executive officer are held by one individual and the chair of the nominations and governance committee serves as the lead director,
ensures that the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all Board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of AbbVie and its
stockholders.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 





​
              In
summary, the proposal would unnecessarily restrict the independent Board members' flexibility, regardless of circumstances, to appoint the individual they think is the most
appropriate person to serve as Chair, even with a balanced, strong lead independent director structure. These undue restrictions on the Board, in light of AbbVie's robust independent oversight
mechanisms, are not in the best interests of stockholders. 
              The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

Corporate Governance Materials 





              AbbVie's
corporate governance guidelines with the outline of directorship qualifications; director independence guidelines; code of business conduct; and audit
committee, compensation committee, nominations and governance committee, and public policy committee charters are all available in the corporate governance section of AbbVie's investor relations
website at www.abbvieinvestor.com. 
  
 
     


Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions 





              It
is AbbVie's policy that the nominations and governance committee review, approve, ratify or disapprove of all transactions in which AbbVie participates and in which
any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related person
transactions requiring review by the nominations and governance committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:


 questionnaires annually distributed to AbbVie's directors and executive officers; 
 certifications submitted annually by AbbVie executive officers related to their compliance with AbbVie's Code of Business Conduct; or  
 communications made directly by the related person to the chief financial officer or general counsel. 

              In
determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the nominations and governance committee will consider the following items, among
others:


 the related person's relationship to AbbVie and interest in the transaction; 
 the material facts of the transaction, including the aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of
principal involved; 
 the benefits to AbbVie of the transaction; 
 if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; 
 an assessment of whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees
generally; 
 whether a transaction has the potential to impair director independence; and 
 whether the transaction constitutes a conflict of interest. 

              This
process is included in the nominations and governance committee's written charter, which is available on the corporate governance section of AbbVie's investor relations website at  www.abbvieinvestor.com.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 





              AbbVie
believes that during 2016 its executive officers and directors timely complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, except that one Form 4 reporting the receipt of stock equivalent units for each director who received stock equivalent units during 2016 was not timely filed due to
administrative error by the company. 
  
 
     


Performance-Based Compensation Arrangements 





              The
Performance Incentive Plan and the Incentive Stock Program are intended to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) to permit deductibility of
performance-based compensation. 
              The
compensation committee reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The committee believes that stockholder
interests are best served by not restricting the committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation
expenses. Accordingly, the committee may from time to time approve components of compensation for certain executive officers that are not deductible. 
              While
the compensation committee does not anticipate there would ever be circumstances where a restatement of earnings upon which any incentive plan award decisions were based would
occur, the committee, in evaluating such circumstances, has discretion to take all actions necessary to protect the interests of stockholders up to and including actions to recover such incentive
awards. 
  
 
     


Exclusive Forum 





              AbbVie
is incorporated in the state of Delaware and Delaware law governs the relationship among its directors, officers, and stockholders (also known as the internal
affairs doctrine). To provide for the orderly, efficient and cost- effective resolution of Delaware-law issues affecting AbbVie, the company's Certificate of Incorporation provides that unless the
board of directors otherwise determines, Delaware courts are the exclusive forum for cases involving the internal affairs doctrine, derivative actions brought on behalf of the company, claims for
breach of fiduciary duty, and other matters concerning Delaware statutory and common law. The provision does not apply to any other cases brought against AbbVie. 
  
 
     


Other Matters 





              The
board of directors knows of no other business to be transacted at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, but if any other matters do come before the meeting, it
is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote or act with respect to them in accordance with their best judgment. 
  
 
     


Date for Receipt of Stockholder Proposals for the 2018 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement 





              Stockholder
proposals for presentation at the 2018 Annual Meeting must be received by AbbVie no later than November 21, 2017 and must otherwise comply with the
applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2018 meeting. 
  
 
     


Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting 





              A
stockholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the secretary of AbbVie. Recommendations
must be accompanied by certain information about both the nominee and the stockholder making the nomination, as set forth in AbbVie's Amended and Restated By-Laws. A nominee who is recommended by a
stockholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 





​
  
 
     


Householding of Proxy Materials 





              The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokers or banks) to satisfy the delivery requirements for
proxy statements with respect to two or more security holders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice or proxy statement addressed to those security holders. This process, which is
commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for security holders and cost savings for companies. 
              Several
brokers and banks with accountholders who are AbbVie stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. As indicated in the notice provided by these brokers to AbbVie
stockholders, a single proxy statement will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once you have
received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at
any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and you prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your broker, or contact Broadridge Financial Solutions at
1-866-540-7095, or write to us at Investor Relations, AbbVie Inc., 1 North Waukegan Road, North Chicago, Illinois 60064. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy
statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker or bank. 
  
 
     


Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 





              This
proxy statement contains certain forward-looking statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance and other matters. The
words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "project" and similar expressions, among others, generally identify "forward-looking statements," which speak only as of the date the statements were made. The
matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or
implied in the forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the
current plans and expectations of AbbVie management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be
achieved or accomplished. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include the matters described in AbbVie's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2016 under Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." AbbVie does not
undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements included in this proxy statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, unless AbbVie is required by applicable
securities law to do so. 
  
 
     


General 





              It
is important that proxies be returned promptly. Stockholders are urged to vote, regardless of the number of shares of AbbVie common stock owned. Stockholders may
vote by telephone, by Internet, or by mail if a printed version of the proxy card was received or requested. Stockholders who vote by telephone or the Internet do not need to return a proxy card. 
              The

    AbbVie Inc.  Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information  Year Ended December 31, 2016  (Unaudited) (In millions, except per share data)    

 
  



Non-GAAP Financial Results     
Financial
results are presented on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Reported results were prepared in accordance with GAAP and include all revenues and expenses recognized during the period.
Non-GAAP results adjust for certain non-cash items and for factors that are unusual or unpredictable, and exclude those costs, expenses, and other specified items. AbbVie's management believes
non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding AbbVie's results of operations and assist management, analysts, and investors in evaluating the performance of the
business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
