Abbott Laboratories  
 Proxy Statement  
Solicitation of Proxies  

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 27, 2001, at Abbott's headquarters, 100
Abbott Park Road, at the intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or about
March 13, 2001. 

 
 
Information about the Annual Meeting     
Who Can Vote 

Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2001, will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2001, Abbott had 1,546,586,357
outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other
matters. 
Cumulative Voting 

Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual
Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy 

All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting.
Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting
by telephone or the Internet can be found with your proxy card. 
Revoking a Proxy 

You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting: 
  by
delivering a written notice to the secretary of Abbott, 
  by
delivering an authorized proxy with a later date, or 
  by
voting by telephone or the Internet after you have given your proxy. 
1


 
Discretionary Voting Authority 

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 13 nominees named in Item 1
on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the judgment of
the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than
the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. 
Where
a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, or the approval of the shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder
has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as
auditors and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
The
board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted
in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
Quorum and Vote Required to Approve Each Item on the Proxy 

A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
Effect of Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions 

A proxy submitted by an institution such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not
being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not
present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on that matter, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares will not affect the
determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to abstain
from voting on that matter will have the effect of votes against that matter. 
Inspectors of Election 

The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
Cost of Soliciting Proxies 

Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott
has retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $17,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. 
Confidential Voting 

It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except: 
  where
disclosure may be required by law or regulation, 
  where
disclosure may be necessary in order for Abbott to assert or defend claims, 
  where
a shareholder provides comments with his or her proxy, 
  where
a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, 
  to
allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or 
  in
limited circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved and recommended by the board of directors.

Information Concerning Security Ownership     
On

Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are G. P. Coughlan, G. W. Linder, and T. M. Wascoe, officers of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares owned by the
Trust is held by and shared among the co-trustees. The co-trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions from the participants, if the co-trustees determine
that a matter to be voted on at a shareholder meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The co-trustees have not determined that any of the matters being considered at
the 2001 Annual Meeting would materially affect the interests of participants. The individual participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by the terms of the Trust. The Trust
Agreement is of unlimited duration. The co-trustees are also fiduciaries for certain other employee benefit trusts maintained by Abbott and have shared voting and/or investment power with
respect to the 3,099,610 common shares (approximately .2 percent of the outstanding shares of Abbott) held by those trusts.

Committees of the Board of Directors     
The
board of directors, which held six meetings in 2000, has five committees established in Abbott's bylaws: the executive committee, audit committee, compensation committee, nominations and board
affairs committee, and public policy committee. 
The
executive committee, whose members are M. D. White, chairman, H. L. Fuller, W. D. Smithburg, and J. R. Walter, did not hold any meetings in 2000. This committee may exercise all the
authority of the board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for board action. 
The
audit committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chairman, D. A. Jones, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell Jr., and J. R. Walter, held three meetings in 2000. This committee provides advice and
assistance regarding accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices of Abbott. Each year, it recommends to the board a firm of independent public accountants to serve as auditors. The audit
committee reviews with such auditors the scope and results of their audit, fees for services, and independence in servicing Abbott. The committee also meets with Abbott's internal auditors to evaluate
the effectiveness of the work they perform. The committee is governed by a written charter adopted by the board of directors, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement.
Each of the members of the audit committee is independent and financially literate, as required of audit committee members by the New York Stock Exchange. A copy of the report of the audit committee
is on page 17. 
The
compensation committee, whose members are H. L. Fuller, chairman, J. M. Greenberg, B. Powell Jr., A. B. Rand, and W. D. Smithburg, held two meetings in 2000. This committee is responsible for
setting and administering the policies and programs that govern both annual compensation and stock ownership programs. A copy of the report of the compensation committee is on pages 11
and 12. 
The
nominations and board affairs committee, whose members are D. A. Jones, chairman, D. A. L. Owen, A. B. Rand, W. A. Reynolds, and R. S. Roberts, held two meetings in 2000. This
committee develops general criteria regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, recommends candidates for such positions to the board of
directors, advises the board of directors with respect to the conduct of board activities, and assists the board in the evaluation of the board's own performance and the performance of the chairman of
the board and chief executive officer. A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by complying with the procedures on page 19. 
The
public policy committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, D. A. Jones, W. A. Reynolds, and R. S. Roberts, held three meetings in 2000. This committee has an advisory role with respect
to public policy, regulatory, and governmental affairs issues that affect Abbott. 
The
average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 2000 was 99 percent. 

 
 
Compensation of Directors     
Abbott
employees are not compensated for serving on the board or board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors'
Fee Plan in the amounts of $5,000 for each month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as a chairman of a board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of
the executive committee). Effective with the 2001 Annual Meeting, non-employee directors will be compensated $6,667 for each month of service as a director. 
Fees
earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form of non-qualified stock options, or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of Abbott or paid into a
grantor trust established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon retirement from the board of directors). If the fees are deferred, the director may elect to have the
fees credited to a stock equivalent account under which the fees accrue the same return they would have earned if invested in Abbott common shares. Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees not
credited to a stock equivalent account. 
Under
the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder meeting receives a restricted
stock award with a fair market value on the date of the award closest to, but not exceeding $52,000 in 2000, and $65,000 in 2001 and subsequent years. In 2000, this was 1,360 shares. The
non-employee directors are entitled to vote these shares and receive all dividends paid on the
shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of Abbott.

Executive Compensation     
Report of the Compensation Committee 

The Compensation Committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is responsible for setting and administering the
policies and programs that govern annual compensation, long-term incentives and stock ownership programs. 
The
foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values and management initiatives. The program: 
  Integrates
compensation programs which link total shareholder return with both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and measurement processes. 
  Supports
a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual performance that is related to both goals and performance of the corporation as compared to that of
industry performance levels. 
  Helps
attract and retain key executives who are critical to the long-term success of the corporation. 
The
key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive award, and long-term incentive awards comprised of equity participation. These components are administered with the
goal of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace, recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance, offers the opportunity to earn above average rewards when
merited by individual and corporate performance and links management's interest in the company with the interest of all shareholders. 
The
marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology emphasis. These companies are included in the
Standard and Poor's Healthcare Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of comparison. 
Using
compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total compensation and each of its elements  base, incentive and long-term equity-based
compensation  is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by the corporation's
performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation programs which are based upon achievement of the
corporation's goals. Each year the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall objectives
discussed above. 
In
2000, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual performance and on the extent to which the business plans for the corporation and their areas of responsibility were achieved or
exceeded. Performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and, therefore, compensation was paid accordingly. Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's performance, current salary in relation to the
salary range designated for the job, experience and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial terms,
the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools, including the development and execution of strategic
plans, the development of management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively taken into
account by management and the compensation committee in determining the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases. 
The
Abbott Performance Incentive Plan (PIP) and Management Incentive Plan (MIP) are designed to reward executives when the corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's
area of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial elements such as consolidated net earnings, profitability, total sales and earnings per share, and non-financial
elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and the successful development of human resources, including Abbott's diversity initiative. Each year, individual base award allocations
are established for PIP participants as a percentage of consolidated net earnings. For 2000, each PIP participant's final award allocation was based on the committee's overall assessment of each
participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. Each year, individual incentive targets are established for MIP participants based on competitive survey data from the group of
companies discussed above. As noted above, awards are paid at levels commensurate with performance of the company relative to peer group companies. Under the MIP, 40% of a participant's target
incentive award is attributable to corporate performance. The remainder of the incentive award is based on the 
11


 

committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the predetermined goals discussed above. 
To
motivate and reward its executives and managers and to directly align key employee and shareholder interests, the corporation has provided long-term incentives in the form of equity participation
for many years. Grants of stock options, replacement stock options and restricted stock awards are important parts of this relationship. To ensure this objective is achieved, executives follow fixed
stock ownership guidelines. 
Targeted
award ranges for stock options and restricted stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation
targets are set based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the target ranges are established such that equity awards are appropriately scaled to the performance of
the company within its peer group. 
Actual
individual awards are determined based on the established competitive target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance. The committee considers the amounts of
options and restricted stock previously granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional options and restricted stock. 
In
2000, the committee granted Mr. White, the corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 3.7%. As reflected in the corporation's financial statements,
Abbott's performance in 2000 included a 4.3% growth in sales, and a 13.2% growth in basic earnings per share. In light of this performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the
committee determined to award Mr. White a bonus and stock option grant. 
It
is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders in achieving the
corporation's long-term business objectives. To that end, the committee continues to assess the impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and take
action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

Table Footnotes  

(1)These
amounts assume hypothetical appreciation rates of 5% and 10% over the term of the option, as required by the SEC, and are not intended to forecast the appreciation of the
stock price. No gain to the named officers will occur unless the price of Abbott's common shares exceeds the options' exercise price.
(2)These
options contain a replacement option feature. When the option's exercise price is paid (or, in the case of a non-qualified stock option, when the option's exercise
price or the withholding taxes resulting on exercise of that option are paid) with shares of Abbott's common stock, a replacement option is granted for the number of shares used to make that payment.
The replacement option has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Abbott's common stock on the date the replacement option is granted, is exercisable in full six months after the date of
grant, and has a term expiring on the expiration date of the original option.
(3)One-third
of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.
(4)Amounts
were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 2000 of 1,545,934,133 and a December 31, 2000 closing market price of $48.4375 per share.

Pension and Retirement Arrangements 

Abbott and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension
benefits are generally based on service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120 months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits. 
The
following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life annuity basis without giving effect to Social
Security offsets and include supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 13. Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all
participants in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts established on behalf of the
officers who participate in that plan. During
2000, the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: M. D. White, $513,406; R. L.
Parkinson Jr., $27,957; G. P. Coughlan, $1,201,925; R. A. Gonzalez, $142,007; J. A. Amundson, $145,009; and W. G. Dempsey, $133,169. As
of December 31, 2000, the years of service credited under the Plan for the named officers were as follows: M. D. White - 16; R. L. Parkinson Jr. - 24; G. P. Coughlan - 10;
R. A. Gonzalez - 20; J. A. Amundson - 17; and W. G. Dempsey - 18. 
On
January 31, 2001, after nearly 25 years of exemplary service, R. L. Parkinson Jr. retired from Abbott. In recognition of his service, Abbott vested the restricted stock
awards Mr. Parkinson was granted in 1997 and 1998 (these shares are described in footnote 1 of the Summary Compensation Table on page 13) and gave him the option to take title to his
company car. Abbott also paid Mr. Parkinson his performance bonus for 2000 (this bonus is also shown on the Summary Compensation Table). Consistent with industry practice and recognizing that
he may consider other opportunities in the health care field, Abbott paid Mr. Parkinson $4,263,000 (equivalent to approximately two years of salary and bonus) in exchange for his agreement not
to compete with Abbott until July 31, 2002. 

Key Employee Retention 

Abbott has change in control arrangements with its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for other key management personnel. The
agreements with the named officers are described below. 
The
agreements with the named officers continue in effect until December 31, 2003, and at the end of each year will automatically be extended through the third year thereafter unless Abbott
notifies the officer that the agreement will not be extended. The agreements also automatically extend for two years following any change in control that occurs while they are in effect. The
agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for specified reasons or if the officer elects to terminate employment under certain circumstances during a potential change in control
or within two years following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 3 times the officer's annual salary and bonus (assuming for this purpose
that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last 3 years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the
pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (both based on the highest of the actual bonus earned, the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, or the average bonus for the past
3 years). The officer will also receive up to 3 years of additional employee benefits (including the value of 3 more years of pension accruals), payment of a portion of any excise taxes
and other related taxes and payments for which the officer is responsible as a result of the agreement, and reimbursement of certain legal, 
15


 

tax and audit fees. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's stock incentive programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the
remainder of their term. Independent
compensation consultants confirm that the level of payments provided under the agreements is consistent with current market practice. 
Under
the agreements, a "change in control" occurs on the earliest of the following dates: 
  The
date any entity or person (including a "group" as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) becomes the beneficial owner of, or
obtains voting control over, 20% or more of the outstanding common shares of Abbott. 
  The
date on which Abbott (A) merges or consolidates with or into another corporation, or merges another corporation into Abbott, in which Abbott is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which any common shares of Abbott are converted into cash, securities of another corporation, or other property, other than a merger or consolidation
of Abbott in which holders of common shares immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of common stock of the surviving corporation or its parent corporation immediately
after the merger as immediately before, or (B) sells or otherwise disposes of substantially all of Abbott's assets. 
  The
date on which there has been a change in a majority of the board of directors of Abbott within a 12 month period unless the nomination for election by Abbott's
shareholders of each new director was approved by the vote of two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were in office at the beginning of the 12 month period. 
A
potential change in control occurs if Abbott enters into an agreement which would result in a change in control, Abbott or anyone else publicly announces an intent to take or consider actions which
would constitute a change in control, any person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 10% or more of Abbott's common shares, or Abbott's board adopts a resolution that a potential change in
control exists. 
Abbott's
stock incentive programs provide that, as of the date of a change in control, all outstanding stock options and limited stock appreciation rights become fully exercisable and the terms and
conditions of any outstanding restricted stock awards are deemed satisfied. The stock incentive programs use a definition of change in control that is generally similar to the definition used in the
agreements except that a change in control is triggered when an entity or person, becomes the beneficial owner of, or obtains voting control over, 30% or more of the outstanding common shares of
Abbott.

Selection of Independent Public Accountants (Item 2 on Proxy Card)     
Abbott's
bylaws provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent public accountants to serve as auditors and that such
appointment shall be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board has appointed Arthur Andersen LLP to act as auditors for the current year. This firm has
served as Abbott's auditors since 1963. The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen LLP as independent public
accountants for 2001.
Representatives
of Arthur Andersen LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to
respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees 

For 2000, Arthur Andersen LLP and its affiliates billed or will bill Abbott an aggregate of $3.8 million for professional services rendered
for the audit of Abbott's 2000 financial statements and the review of Abbott's financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q
filed by Abbott in 2000. 
Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees 

For 2000, Arthur Andersen LLP did not render any professional services for Abbott in connection with Financial Information Systems Design and
Implementation. 
All Other Fees 

For 2000, Arthur Andersen LLP billed Abbott an aggregate of $6.2 million for all other non-audit services performed for Abbott. 

 
 
Report of the Audit Committee     
Management
is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an audit of Abbott's financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for expressing an opinion on those financial statements based on their audit. The audit committee reviews these processes on behalf of the
board of directors. In this context, the committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2000 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its
independent auditors. 
The
committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit
Committees), as amended. 
The
committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence
Discussions with Audit Committees), as amended, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence. The committee has also considered whether the provision of
the services described above under the captions "Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees" and "All Other Fees" is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
auditors. 
Based
on the review and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shareholder Proposal Relating to  Prescription Drug Pricing  (Item 3 on Proxy Card)     
A
shareholder proposal is included in this proxy statement. Abbott is advised that the proposal will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed resolution and the statement made in
support thereof are presented below. The names and addresses of the shareholders submitting the proposal will be furnished by Abbott to any person requesting such information.  The board of directors recommends that you vote
AGAINST the proposal.

 
 
Shareholder Proposal     
Whereas:
Important as prescription drugs are, not everyone has access to them. Millions of Americans have inadequate or no insurance coverage for drugs; 
Most
people without drug coverage purchase their needed drugs at a retail pharmacy; 
A
Report prepared for the President by the Department of Health and Human Services (Prescription Drug Coverage, Spending, Utilization, and Prices,
April 2000) found that: 
  Individuals
without drug coverage pay a higher price at the retail pharmacy than the total price paid on behalf of those with drug coverage. 
  In
1999, excluding the effects of rebates, the typical cash customer paid nearly 15% more than the customer with third-party coverage. For a quarter of the most common
drugs, the price difference between cash and third parties was even higher  over 20%. 
  For
the most commonly prescribed drugs, the price difference between cash customers and those with third-party coverage grew substantially larger between 1996 and 1999. 
This
same Report found that the markup added by the wholesaler, after purchase from the manufacturer, is "generally small, perhaps 2% - 4%." (ch. 3, p. 101); 
The
literature cited in the Report suggests that pharmacy margins have been falling in recent years; (p. 103) 
Pharmaceutical
manufacturers spent $1.9 billion on advertising in 1999  double the amount spent in 1997 (Business Week
May 22, 2000); 
RESOLVED:
Shareholders request the Board of Directors to: 

1.Create
and implement a policy of price restraint on prescription drugs, utilizing a combination of approaches to keep drug prices at reasonable levels.
2.Report
to shareholders by September, 2001 on changes in policies and pricing procedures for prescription drugs (withholding any competitive information, and at reasonable cost). 

 
 
Proponent's Statement in Support of Shareholder Proposal     
We
suggest that the policy include a restraint on each individual drug and that it not be based on averages which can mask tremendous disparities: a low price increase for one compound and a high
price increase for another; one price for a "favored customer" (usually low) and another for the retail customer (usually high). 
We
understand the need for ongoing research and appreciate the role that our company has played in the development of new medicines. We are also aware that the cost of research is only one determinant
for the final price of a drug. Advertising is another significant company expenditure. Thus, we believe that price restraint can be achieved without sacrificing necessary research efforts. 

 
 
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to Shareholder Proposal     
Abbott
Laboratories is committed to responsible pricing to ensure the broadest possible access to its products. The company shares the shareholders' concern that millions of Americans do not have
access to prescription drugs. Lack of insurance coverage, not prices, is the fundamental cause of inadequate access. Abbott supports efforts directed toward strengthening and improving current
insurance programs, particularly Medicare, so that senior citizens and others without adequate insurance may purchase the medicines needed to sustain a high quality of life. 
Abbott
continues to price all of its products responsibly and competitively. The company adjusts its prices based on a number of factors, including our responsibility to fund appropriate levels of
research and development to sustain future product development. This investment is particularly critical today as expanding scientific knowledge creates unprecedented opportunities to convert this
understanding into medical products of 
18


 

extraordinary value to patients. Many other related factors all influence pricing decisions including, currency exchange and global inflation rates; government regulatory requirements; patent life and
market exclusivity timeframes; added product value and scientific superiority; competitive landscape; and cost of goods. 
In
addition to the company's philosophy of responsible pricing, Abbott assists patients unable to afford medications. Abbott provides free prescriptions to thousands of patients. Our Early Access
Program for Kaletra is an example of how the company has provided free drug access to thousands of HIV/AIDS patients prior to approval. 
A
policy of price constraints will not address the issue of access or serve the best interests of patients, who rely on the company's significant investment in research and development to develop
innovative, cost-effective medicines that save and improve lives. 
The board of directors recommends you vote AGAINST the proposal.

 
 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership  Reporting Compliance     
Due
to administrative errors, three reports for Boone Powell Jr., a director of the corporation, were filed late. All three reports were related to the administration of his parents' estates: two
reporting inheritances of Abbott common stock and the other reporting a purchase of Abbott common stock from his father's estate. Due to a clerical oversight on the part of Abbott, one report of a
purchase of Abbott stock by Roxanne Austin, a director of Abbott, was filed late.  

 
 
Other Matters     
Five
shareholder derivative suits relating to alleged noncompliance with the United States Food and Drug Administration's Quality System Regulation at Abbott's Diagnostic Division facilities in Lake
County, Illinois have been filed against Abbott's current directors and, in two of these suits, against certain former directors. These derivative actions allege the defendants breached their
fiduciary duties by, among other things, allowing the alleged regulatory noncompliance and causing Abbott to pay $100 million to the federal government and withdraw certain medical diagnostic
kits from the U.S. market. The plaintiffs request unspecified monetary damages, including punitive and exemplary damages, to be paid to Abbott, reimbursement of their legal fees and costs, and various
forms of other relief. As required by its restated articles of incorporation, Abbott has advanced defense costs on behalf of the present and former directors named in these suits. 

 
 
Date for Receipt of Shareholder Proposals for the 2001 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement     
Shareholder
proposals for presentation at the 2002 Annual Meeting must be received by Abbott no later than November 13, 2001 and must otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and proxy for the 2002 meeting.  

 
 
Procedure for Recommendation and Nomination of Directors and Transaction of Business at Annual Meeting     
A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the chairman of the nominations and board affairs committee or the
secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. 
A
shareholder may directly nominate persons for director only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit the names of such persons in writing to the secretary of Abbott not
earlier than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. The nominations must be accompanied by a statement setting forth the name, age,
business address, residence address, principal occupation, qualifications, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the nominee and the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the
shareholder making the nomination. 
A
shareholder may properly bring business before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders only by complying with the following procedure: the shareholder must submit to the secretary of Abbott, not earlier
than October 1 nor later than the first business day of January prior to the date of the Annual Meeting, a written statement describing the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting
such business at the Annual Meeting, the name, record address, and number of shares of Abbott owned by the shareholder making the submission, and a description of any material interest of the
shareholder in such business.
