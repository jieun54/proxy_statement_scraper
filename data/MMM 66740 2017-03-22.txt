DIRECTOR NOMINEES
SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
The Nominating and Governance Committee
identifies, reviews, and recommends nominees to the Board for approval. The
Committee seeks individuals with distinguished records of leadership and success
and who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committee considers a wide
range of factors and experiences, including ensuring an experienced, qualified
Board with expertise in the following areas relevant to 3M. The numbers in
parentheses represent the number of director nominees who possess each of the
skills and experiences.

Table of Contents


Significant Corporate Governance
    Actions
We recently implemented several changes
that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong corporate governance
practices:
Board
Refreshment
We regularly add directors to infuse new
ideas and fresh perspectives into the boardroom. In the past four years, six new
independent directors have joined our Board. In recruiting directors, we focus
on how the experience and skill set of each individual complements those of
their fellow directors to create a balanced board with diverse viewpoints and
backgrounds, deep expertise, and strong leadership experience. Gregory R. Page
and Patricia A. Woertz joined the Board in February 2016. Both are accomplished
business leaders with significant experience directly relevant to 3Ms strategic
vision and business strategies. Gregory R. Page is the retired Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer of Cargill, Incorporated and brings
exceptional experience in running a complex global business. Patricia A. Woertz
is the retired Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company and brings considerable
experience in creating stockholder value, global operations, and risk
management.
Stockholder
Engagement
We maintain a vigorous stockholder
engagement program. During 2016, members of senior management met with a
cross-section of stockholders owning approximately 35 percent of our outstanding
shares. The meetings included an overview of the Company and a discussion of the
Companys practices on corporate governance. 3Ms Chief Sustainability Officer
also attended these meetings and summarized 3Ms more than 40 years of
environmental stewardship. The feedback from these meetings was shared with the
Board of Directors and helped inform the Board on corporate governance practices
and trends.
Executive Compensation


2016 Financial Performance and Business
      Highlights
For 3M, 2016 was a year of strong
financial performance achieved through disciplined execution in a challenging
macro environment.

was in the top one-third of our executive compensation peer group for the one-,
three-, and five-year periods ending on December 31, 2016. For additional
information, see Total Stockholder Return on page 40 of this Proxy
Statement.

      Compensation
The illustration below shows how the target Total
Direct Compensation of the Named Executive Officers was apportioned among base
salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives for 2016.


CEO
     
Other NEOs (Average)





 




Compensation Policies and
  Practices
Our compensation program is designed to
provide appropriate performance incentives and avoid compensation practices that
do not promote the interests of our stockholders.


WE DO
     
WE DO NOT


 



✓Maintain a strong alignment
      between corporate performance and compensation by having a majority of
      Total Direct Compensation consist of performance-based
      compensation.
✓Conduct an annual assessment to
      identify and mitigate risks in the design of our incentive compensation
      programs.
✓Have a comprehensive clawback
      policy.
✓Use an independent compensation
      consultant retained by, and reporting directly to, the Compensation
      Committee.
✓Limit the number and amount of
      executive perquisites.
✓Prohibit our executive officers
      from hedging or pledging 3M common stock.
✓Maintain robust stock ownership
      guidelines applicable to all of our executive
officers.
✓Conduct competitive benchmarking
      to align executive compensation with the market.


✗Have employment, severance, or
      change in control agreements with any of our executive
      officers.
✗Provide tax gross-ups on
      executive perquisites.
✗Have agreements that would
      provide automatic single-trigger accelerated vesting of equity
      compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our executive
      officers in the event of a change in control. 
✗Provide dividends or dividend
      equivalents on unearned equity awards. 
✗Reprice stock options without
      the approval of 3M stockholders, except for anti-dilution adjustments
      (such as adjustments in connection with a stock split, spinoff,
      etc.)

Table of Contents


Noteworthy
      Compensation Actions During 2016
During 2016, we implemented the
following changes with respect to our executive compensation program:


●

Amended the definition of
      Retirement in our Annual Incentive Plan and our 2008 Long-Term Incentive
      Plan effective as of January 1, 2016, to mean a termination of employment
      with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least 10 years of service.
      Prior to this change, the term Retirement meant a termination of
      employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least five
      years of service. This change was made to better align the benefits of
      long-term service to the Company with the commitment required to earn
      them. The previous definition continues to apply to awards granted under
      our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan before January 1,
      2016.

●

Recalculated the number of shares
      required to be beneficially owned by our executive officers in order to
      maintain compliance with our stock ownership guidelines, effective
      December 31, 2016.

CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE AT 3M
Proposal No. 1: Elect the Eleven
Directors Identified in this Proxy Statement
At the 2017 Annual Meeting, eleven
directors are to be elected to hold office until the 2018 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. All
nominees are presently 3M directors who were elected by stockholders at the 2016
Annual Meeting. We expect each nominee for election as a director to be able to
serve if elected. If any nominee is not able to serve, proxies will be voted in
favor of the remainder of those nominated and may be voted for substitute
nominees, unless the Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on
the Board. Each nominee elected as a director will continue in office until his

Following each nominees biographical information, we have provided information

that led the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board to determine that
each nominee should serve as a director. In addition, the majority of our

them with additional board leadership and governance experience, exposure to
best practices, and substantial knowledge and skills that further enhance the

Board Membership
Criteria
3Ms Corporate Governance Guidelines
contain Board Membership Criteria which include a list of skills and
characteristics expected to be represented on 3Ms Board. The Nominating and
Governance Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills
and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board
composition. It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a
high performance organization creating competitive advantage for the Company. To
perform as such, the Board will be composed of individuals who have
distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena of activity and
who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committees and the Boards
assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of:


●

Roles in and contributions
      valuable to the business community;

●

Personal qualities of leadership,
      character, judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and maintains
      throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community at large of
      integrity, trust, respect, competence, and adherence to the highest
      ethical standards;

●

Relevant knowledge and diversity
      of background and experience in business, manufacturing, technology,
      finance and accounting, marketing, international business, government, and
      other areas; and

●

Whether the candidate is free of
      conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation, and
      attendance at all meetings.
In addition to these minimum
requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominees skills are
complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for
particular expertise in certain areas, and will assess the nominees impact on
Board dynamics, effectiveness, and diversity of experience and
perspectives.

2017 Proxy Statement  |  13


Table of Contents


Diversity
The Board of Directors values diversity
as a factor in selecting nominees to serve on the Board because its experience
is that diversity provides significant benefit to the Board and the Company.
Although there is no specific policy on diversity, the Committee considers the
Board Membership Criteria in selecting nominees
for directors, including diversity of background and experience. Such
considerations may include gender, race, national origin, functional background,
executive or professional experience, and international experience.


Identification, Evaluation, and
Selection of Nominees
The Committee periodically reviews the
appropriate size and composition of the Board and anticipates future vacancies
and needs of the Board. In the event the Committee recommends an increase in the
size of the Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified
nominees from several sources, including current Board members and nominees
recommended by stockholders and other persons.
The Committee may from time to time
retain a director search firm to help the Committee identify qualified director
nominees for consideration by the Committee. 
The Committee retained Spencer Stuart
in 2016 to help identify future Board candidates.
The Committee evaluates qualified
director nominees at regular or special Committee meetings against the Board
Membership Criteria described above then in effect and reviews qualified
director nominees with the Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board
interview candidates that meet the Board Membership Criteria and the Committee
selects nominees that best suit the Boards current needs and recommends one or
more of such individuals for election to the Board.


Director
Independence
The Board has adopted a formal set of
Director Independence Guidelines with respect to the determination of director
independence, which either conform to or are more exacting than the independence
requirements of the NYSE listing standards, and the full text of which is
available on our Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations 
Governance. In accordance with these Guidelines, a director or nominee for
director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company
other than as a director. The Guidelines specify the criteria by which the
independence of our directors will be determined, including strict guidelines
for directors and their immediate family members with respect to past employment
or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting
firm. The Guidelines also prohibit Audit and Compensation Committee members from
having any direct or indirect financial relationship with the Company, and
restrict both commercial and not-for-profit relationships of all directors with
the Company. Directors may not be given personal loans or extensions of credit
by the Company, and all directors are required to deal at arms length with the
Company and its subsidiaries, and to disclose any circumstance that might be
perceived as a conflict of interest.
In accordance with these Guidelines,
the Board undertook its annual review of director independence. During this
review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each
director, or any member of his or her immediate
family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in each of the most
recent three completed fiscal years. The Board also considered whether there
were any transactions or relationships between the Company and a director or any
members of a directors immediate family (or any entity of which a director or
an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or
significant equity holder). The Board considered that in the ordinary course of
business, transactions may occur between the Company and its subsidiaries and
companies at which some of our directors are or have been officers. In
particular, the Board considered the annual amount of sales to 3M for each of
the most recent three completed fiscal years by each of the companies where
directors serve or have served as an executive officer, as well as purchases by
those companies from 3M. The Board determined that the amount of sales and
purchases in each fiscal year was below one percent of the annual revenues of
each of those companies, the threshold set forth in the Director Independence
Guidelines. The Board also considered charitable contributions to not-for-profit
organizations with which our directors or immediate family members are
affiliated, none of which approached the threshold set forth in our Director
Independence Guidelines.
As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively
determined that the following directors are independent under these Guidelines:
Sondra L. Barbour, Thomas Tony K. Brown, Vance D. Coffman, David B. Dillon,

14  |  3M


Table of Contents
Michael L. Eskew, Herbert L. Henkel,
Muhtar Kent, Edward M. Liddy, Gregory R. Page, Robert J. Ulrich, and Patricia A.
Woertz. The Board has also determined that members of the Audit Committee and
Compensation Committee received no compensation from the Company other than for service as a director. Inge G. Thulin, Chairman
of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is considered to not be
independent because of his employment by the Company.


Nominees Proposed by Stockholders

The Committee has a policy to consider
properly submitted stockholder recommendations for candidates for membership on
the Board of Directors. Stockholders proposing individuals for consideration by
the Committee must include at least the following information about the proposed
nominee: the proposed nominees name, age, business or residence address,
principal occupation or employment, and whether such person has given written
consent to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected. Stockholders should send the required information about the
proposed nominee to:


 
Corporate Secretary

3M Company

St. Paul, MN
  55144-1000.
In order for an individual proposed by
a stockholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation as a Board
nominee for the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Corporate Secretary must receive the
proposal by November 22, 2017. Such proposals must be sent via registered,
certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the stockholder to
determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The Corporate
Secretary will send properly submitted stockholder proposed nominations to the
Committee Chair for consideration at a future Committee meeting. Individuals
proposed by stockholders in accordance with these procedures will receive the
same consideration received by individuals identified to the Committee through
other means.


Stockholder Nominations - Advance
Notice Bylaw
In addition, 3Ms Bylaws permit
stockholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of stockholders or at a
special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with the
notice of meeting. Stockholders intending to nominate a person for election as a
director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Companys Bylaws.
With respect to nominations to be acted upon at our 2018 Annual Meeting, our
Bylaws would require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary receive written notice from the record stockholder
no earlier than November 22, 2017, and no later than December 22, 2017. The

access nomination notices must be received by the Company no earlier than
November 22, 2017, and no later than December 22, 2017. The notice must contain

Role of the Nominating and
Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee
identifies individuals who the Committee believes are qualified to become Board
members in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria set forth above, and
recommends selected individuals to the Board for nomination to stand for
election at the next meeting of stockholders of the Company in which directors
will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on the Board between
meetings  of stockholders, the Committee
seeks to identify individuals who the Committee believes are qualified to become
Board members in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria, and may
recommend one or more of such individuals for appointment to the Board. The
Nominating and Governance Committee also focuses on overall Board-level
succession planning at the director level.

Board Approved Long-Term Strategic
Plans and Capital Allocation Strategies


✓Each year management presents to the Board, and the Board discusses
      and approves, detailed long-term strategic plans for the Company, the
      international business, and each of the Companys business groups. Each
      presentation includes an overview of the business group, the financial
      performance, an assessment of the portfolio for growth opportunities using
      a SWOT analysis (i.e., strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats);
      strategic priorities to drive the three key value creation
      leversPortfolio Management, Investing in Innovation, and Business
      Transformation; plans to drive the four corporate fundamental
      strengthsTechnology, Manufacturing, Global Capabilities, and Brand; and
      the projected long-term financial performance.
✓The Board also approves the long-term capital structure of the
      Company to ensure that there is sufficient capital to invest for future
      growth.
●The Company is committed to
      investing in organic growth, most notably through capital expenditures and
      research and development. The Company has invested over $16 billion in
      capital expenditures and research and development to support and fund
      organic growth over the past five years. 3M has opened six customer
      technical centers around the world, and a new, state-of-the-art research
      and development laboratory in the United States.
●The capital allocation
      plans have flexibility to respond quickly to strategic
      acquisition opportunities that can strengthen the
      Companys portfolio. Over the past five years, 3M has
      invested approximately $5 billion in strategic
      acquisitions to build upon and strengthen its business
      portfolio for continued future growth.
●The Company has a long
      history of returning cash to stockholders, having paid
      approximately $11 billion in dividends over the past
      five years.

      approximately $22 billion to stockholders
      via share repurchases.

      skills and knowledge necessary for the
performance of their duties. These programs may

Corporate
      Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted Corporate
Governance Guidelines which provide a framework for the effective governance of
the Company. The guidelines address matters such as the respective roles and
responsibilities of the Board and management, the Boards leadership structure,
the responsibilities of the independent Lead Director, director independence,
the Board Membership Criteria, Board committees, and Board and management
evaluation. The Boards Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for
overseeing and reviewing the Guidelines at least
annually and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for approval. The
Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
the charters of the Board committees, the Director Independence Guidelines, and
the Codes of Conduct provide the framework for the governance of the Company and
are available on our Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations 
Governance.


Boards
      Role in Risk Oversight
The Board has delegated to the Audit
Committee through its charter the primary responsibility for the oversight of
risks facing the Company including cybersecurity. The Audit Committees charter
provides that the Audit Committee shall discuss policies and procedures with
respect to risk assessment and risk management, the Companys major risk
exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such
exposures.
The Vice President and General Auditor,
Corporate Auditing (the Auditor), whose appointment and performance is
reviewed and evaluated by the Audit Committee and who has direct reporting
obligations to the Committee, is responsible for leading the formal risk
assessment and management process within the Company. The Auditor, through
consultation with the Companys senior management, periodically assesses the
major risks facing the Company and works with those executives responsible for
managing each specific risk. The Auditor periodically reviews with the Audit
Committee the major risks facing the Company and
the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. The
Auditors risk management report, which is provided in advance of the meeting,
is reviewed with the entire Board by either the chair of the Audit Committee or
the Auditor. The executive responsible for managing a particular risk may also
report to the full Board on how the risk is being managed and
mitigated.
While the Boards oversight of risk
primarily is performed by the Audit Committee, the Board has delegated to other
committees the oversight of risks within their areas of responsibility and
expertise. For example, the Compensation Committee oversees risks associated
with the Companys compensation practices, including by performing an annual
review of the Companys risk assessment of its compensation policies and
practices for its employees. The Finance Committee oversees risks associated
with the Companys capital structure, credit ratings and cost of capital,
long-term benefit obligations, and use of or investment in financial 
2017 Proxy Statement  |  19


Table of Contents
products, such as derivatives to manage
risk related to foreign currencies, commodities, and interest rates. The
Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks associated with the Companys
overall governance and its succession planning process to ensure that the
Company has a slate of future, qualified candidates for key management
positions.
The Board believes that its oversight
of risks, primarily through delegation to the Audit Committee, but also through
delegation to other committees to oversee specific risks within their areas of
responsibility and expertise, and the sharing of information with the full
Board, is appropriate for a diversified technology and manufacturing company like 3M. The chair of each committee that oversees
risk provides a summary of the matters discussed with the committee to the full
Board following each committee meeting. The minutes of each committee meeting
are also provided to all Board members. The Board also believes its oversight of
risk is enhanced by its current leadership structure (further discussed below)
because the CEO, who is ultimately responsible for the Companys management of
risk, also chairs regular Board meetings. Given his in-depth knowledge and
understanding of the Company, the CEO is best able to bring key business issues
and risks to the Boards attention.


Management Succession
Planning
The Board plans the succession to the
position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management positions. To assist the
Board, the Chairman/CEO and Senior Vice President
of Human Resources annually assess senior managers and their succession
potential for the position of Chairman/CEO and other senior management
positions.


Communication with
Directors
The Board of Directors has adopted the
following process for stockholders and other interested parties to send
communications to members of the Board. Stockholders and other interested
parties may communicate with the Lead Director, the chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees of the Board, or with any of our other independent directors,
or all of them as a group, by sending a letter to the following address:
Corporate Secretary, 3M Company, 3M Center, Building 220-14W-06, St. Paul, MN
55144-1000.
Compliance


3Ms
      Codes of Conduct
More than a century of operating with
uncompromising integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility
with our communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our employees,
including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief
Accounting Officer, are required to abide by 3Ms Code of Conduct to ensure that
our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. These
policies form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes compliance
with corporate policies and procedures and a Company-wide focus on
uncompromising integrity in every aspect of our operations. Our Code of Conduct
covers many topics, including antitrust and competition law, conflicts of
interest, financial reporting, protection of confidential information, and
compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of our
business.
Employees are required to report any
conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of
the Code of Conduct. The Audit Committee has
adopted procedures to receive, retain, and treat complaints received regarding
accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for
the confidential and anonymous submission by employees or others of concerns
regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Information on how to
submit any such communications can be found on 3Ms Investor Relations Web site,
under Governance  Governance Documents  Employee Business Conduct Policies 
Report a concern or ask a question. Our Chief Compliance Officer, who has
direct reporting obligations to the Audit Committee, periodically reports to the
Audit Committee on compliance with the Companys Code of Conduct, including the
effectiveness of the Companys compliance program.
The Board also has adopted a Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors of the Company. This Code incorporates
long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure
the Companys

business and the activities of the
Board are conducted with integrity and adherence to the highest ethical
standards, and in compliance with the law.

employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors are
available on our Web site at www.3M.com under Investor Relations 
Governance  Governance Documents.


Public
      Policy Engagement
The Company believes that transparency
with respect to the consideration, processes, and oversight of our engagement
with lawmakers is important to our stockholders, and continuously makes efforts
to give our stockholders useful information about our public policy engagement.
Since 2007 (and updated several times since then), the Company has voluntarily
published a detailed explanation of the Companys political activities which is
available on our Web site at www.3M.com under Investor Relations 
Governance  Governance Documents  Political Activities and Issue Advocacy.
There, the Company sets out in detail its positions on important public policy
issues, the factors we consider when making political contributions, and the
processes we use for legal, financial, executive, and Board oversight of
our political activities and contributions. We
also provide links to the reports the 3M Political Action Committee files
monthly with the Federal Election Commission and the Companys quarterly
Lobbying Disclosure reports, as well as a detailed list of our contributions to
state candidates and political parties, and contributions to 527 political
organizations. The Company also discloses on its Web site the trade associations
the Company joined where $25,000 or more of the dues are allocated for lobbying
purposes by the trade association. The Company believes that these disclosures
on our Web site, which exceed the disclosures required by law, offer
transparency respecting the Companys public policy engagement and political
activities.


Commitment to the Environment and
      Sustainability
At 3M, we are working hard to help
create a better world for people everywhere. We apply our ingenuity, our
expertise, and our technology to solve problems innovatively, and with a focus
on solutions for the longer term. Sustainability is fundamental to our business
philosophy  from product development and manufacturing to how customers use our
products.
For more than 40 years, 3M has been a
leader among global corporations in sustainability actions and measures,
beginning with the creation of its groundbreaking Pollution Prevention Pays (3P)
Program in 1975 to a broad portfolio of sustainable products today. As a global
corporation, we believe that we have a significant responsibility to society in
general, and especially to the communities in which we live and work. Fulfilling
our responsibility is important both from an environmental stewardship
perspective and as a key competitive strategy. Our corporate vision states: 3M
technology advancing every company... 3M products enhancing every home... and 3M
innovation improving every life. It is that vision  that focuses on our
customers needs and well-being  that guides our sustainability strategies and
goals, and the respect we demonstrate for our social and physical
environments.
We have created hundreds of sustainable
solutions and product platforms to help our customers manage their environmental
footprint  from paint systems that reduce the need for cleaning solvents and
window films that ease energy consumption to a greener tape that is made with
plant-based adhesive and film.
In January 2013, our CEO formed the
Sustainability Center of Excellence to focus on developing and commercializing
products which help our customers solve their sustainability challenges and on
ensuring sustainability within 3M operations and supply chain. The Vice
President of Environment, Health, Safety, and Sustainability reports to the
Senior Vice President of 3M Supply Chain, who reports to the CEO. The formation
of the Sustainability Center of Excellence demonstrates the Companys commitment
to integrate innovation and sustainability into our products and operations for
the benefit of our customers and our communities. The primary role of the Center
is to develop strategy, set significant goals to track progress, and drive
sustainable actions throughout 3M. Sustainability will continue to be a vital
focus as we work to truly advance every company, enhance every home, and improve
every life.
As part of our sustainability efforts,
we are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights  a
policy initiative for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to ten
principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and
anti-corruption. We will report annually on these corporate responsibility
efforts in our Sustainability Report. To learn more about our sustainability
efforts, please view our Sustainability Report which is available on our Web
site at www.3M.com under About 3M  Sustainability.

Related
      Person Transaction Policy and
Procedures
The Board of Directors has adopted a
written Related Person Transaction Policy and Procedures which is administered
by the Nominating and Governance Committee. This Policy applies to any
transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a
participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person (as that
term is defined in the Policy) has a direct or indirect material interest and
which is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.
Transactions that fall within this definition are referred to the Committee for
approval, ratification, or other action. Based on its consideration of all of
the relevant facts and circumstances, the Committee decides whether or not to
approve a transaction and approves only those transactions that are in the best
interests of the Company. In the course of its review and approval or
ratification of a transaction, the Committee considers: 
●the nature of the Related
Persons interest in the transaction;
●the material terms of the
transaction, including whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable
than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or
similar circumstances;
●the significance of the
transaction to the Related Person;
●the significance of the
transaction to the Company;
●whether the transaction would
impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best
interest of the Company; and
●any other matters the Committee
deems appropriate.
Any Committee member who is a Related
Person with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the
deliberations or vote respecting such approval or ratification, except that such
a director may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
at which the Committee considers the transaction.


Policy on
      Adoption of a Rights Plan
In 2002 and 2003, a 3M stockholder
submitted a stockholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for
adopting a stockholders rights plan (also known as a poison pill). 3M does
not have a rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board
continues to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which
adoption of a rights plan would give the Board the negotiating power and
leverage necessary to obtain the best result for 3M stockholders in the context
of a takeover effort.
Following consideration of the
favorable vote the stockholder proposal received and in light of this belief,
the Board adopted and has reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The
Boards policy is that it will only adopt a
rights plan if either (1) stockholders have approved adoption of the rights plan
or (2) the Board (including a majority of the independent members of the Board),
in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, makes a determination that,
under the circumstances existing at the time, it is in the best interests of
3Ms stockholders to adopt a rights plan without the delay in adoption resulting
from seeking stockholder approval.
The Board has directed the Nominating
and Governance Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and
to report to the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy.
The terms of the policy, as in effect, are included in 3Ms published Corporate
Governance Guidelines and its Proxy Statement.
Board Structure and
Processes


Boards
      Leadership Structure
The Boards leadership structure is
characterized by: 
●a combined Chairman of the Board
and CEO;
●a strong, independent, and highly
experienced Lead Director with well-defined responsibilities that support the
Boards oversight responsibilities;
●a robust committee structure
consisting entirely of independent directors with oversight of various types of
risks; and
●an engaged and independent
Board.
The Board of Directors believes that
this leadership structure provides independent board leadership and engagement
while deriving the benefits of having our CEO also serve as Chairman of the
Board. As the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Companys
day-to-day operations and with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the
Company, our CEO is best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the
directors discuss key business and strategic issues. Coupled with an independent
Lead Director, 
22  |  3M



Table of Contents
this combined structure provides
independent oversight while avoiding unnecessary confusion regarding the Boards
oversight responsibilities and the day-to-day management of business
operations.
The Board believes that adopting a
rigid policy on whether to separate or combine the positions of Chairman of the
Board and CEO would inhibit the Boards ability to provide for a leadership
structure that would best serve stockholders. As a result, the Board has
rejected adopting a policy permanently separating or combining the positions of
Chairman and CEO in its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed at
least annually and available on our Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor
Relations  Governance. Instead, the Board adopted an approach that allows it,
in representing the stockholders best interests, to decide who should serve as
Chairman or CEO, or both, under present or anticipated future
circumstances.
The Board believes that combining the
roles of CEO and Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective Board. The
Board believes that to drive change and continuous improvement within the
Company, tempered by respect for 3Ms traditions and values, the CEO must have
maximum authority. The CEO is primarily responsible for effectively leading
significant change, improving operational efficiency, driving growth, managing
the Companys day-to-day business, managing the various risks facing the
Company, and reinforcing the expectation for all employees of continuing to
build on 3Ms century-old tradition of uncompromising integrity and doing
business the right way.
The Board believes that the Companys
corporate governance measures ensure that strong, independent directors continue
to effectively oversee the Companys management and key issues related to
executive compensation, CEO evaluation and succession planning, strategy, risk,
and integrity. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide, in part,
that:


●

Independent directors comprise a
      substantial majority of the Board;

●

Directors are elected annually by
      a majority vote in uncontested director elections;

●

Only independent directors serve
      on the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance
      Committees;

●

The committee chairs establish
      their respective agendas;

●

The Board and committees may
      retain their own advisors;

●

The independent directors have
      complete access to management and employees;

●

The independent directors meet in
      executive session without the CEO or other employees during each regular
      Board meeting; and

●

The Board and each committee
      regularly conduct a self-evaluation to determine whether it and its
      committees function effectively.
The Board has also designated one of
its members to serve as Lead Director, with responsibilities (described in the
next section) that are similar to those typically performed by an independent
chairman.


Independent Lead
      Director
The Board has designated one of its
members to serve as a Lead Director, with responsibilities that are similar to
those typically performed by an independent chairman (Lead Director). Michael
L. Eskew was appointed Lead Director by the independent directors effective
November 12, 2012, succeeding Dr. Vance Coffman who had served as Lead Director
since 2006. Michael Eskew is a highly experienced director, currently serving on
the boards of The Allstate Corporation, Eli Lilly and Company, and International
Business Machines Corporation, and
was the former Chairman and CEO of United
Parcel Service, Inc. His responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the
following:


●

Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not
      present, including executive sessions of the independent
      directors;

●

Acts as a key liaison between the
      Chairman/CEO and the independent directors;

●

Approves the meeting agendas for
      the Board, and approves the meeting schedules to assure that there is
      sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;

●

Has the authority to approve the
      materials to be delivered to the directors in advance of each Board
      meeting and provides feedback regarding the quality, quantity, and
      timeliness of those materials (this duty not only gives the Lead Director
      approval authority with respect to materials to be delivered to the
      directors in advance of each Board meeting but also provides a feedback
      mechanism so that the materials may be improved for future
      meetings);

●

Has the authority to call
      meetings of the independent directors;

●

Communicates Board member
      feedback to the Chairman/CEO (except that the chair of the Compensation
      Committee leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEOs performance and
      communicates the Boards evaluation of that performance to the
      Chairman/CEO);

●

If requested by major
      stockholders, ensures that he is available, when appropriate, for
      consultation and direct communication; and

●

Performs such other duties as
      requested by the independent directors.

and Governance Committee solicits and receives comments from all directors and
shares those comments with the Board. Based on the comments and further
discussion and reflection, the Board makes an assessment reviewing areas in
which the Board believes improvements could be made to increase the
effectiveness of the Board and its committees as well as identifying existing
practices which have contributed to high effectiveness and accordingly should be
continued. Self-evaluation items requiring follow-up and/or the development and
execution of implementation and action plans are monitored on a going-forward
basis by the full Board, as well as by individual
committees and the chairs thereof, as applicable. While this formal
self-evaluation is conducted on an annual basis, directors share perspectives,
feedback, and suggestions year-round. The Board and each committee conducted an
evaluation of its performance in 2016.
Before the November Board meeting, the
Chairman/CEO, Lead Director, and chair of the Nominating and Governance
Committee meet to discuss the performance and contributions of each director. As
part of the nomination process, the Nominating and Governance Committee
considers the performance and contributions of each director and evaluates each
of the directors to ensure our directors continue to possess the necessary
skills and experience to effectively oversee the Company.


Board and
      Committee Information
The Board currently has twelve
directors and the following four committees: Audit, Compensation, Finance, and
Nominating and Governance. The membership and the function of each committee are
described below.
During 2016, the Board of Directors held five regularly
scheduled meetings and one telephonic meeting. Overall attendance at Board and
committee meetings was 99 percent. During 2016, all of our directors attended at
least 75% of all Board and Committee meetings on which they served.
The Company has a long-standing policy
that directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless
extenuating circumstances prevent them from attending. Eleven directors attended
last years Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which constituted all directors who
were members of the Board as of the 2016 Annual Meeting date, except for one
director who had a family medical emergency and was unable to attend the 2016
Annual Meeting.

Director
Compensation and Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Nominating and Governance Committee
periodically receives reports on the status of Board compensation in relation to
other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending to the Board
changes in compensation for non-employee directors. In developing its
recommendations, the Committee is guided by the following goals:


●
Compensation should fairly pay directors for work required in a
      company of 3Ms size and scope;

●
A significant portion of the total compensation should be paid
      in common stock to align directors interests with the long-term interests
      of stockholders; and

●
The structure of the
      compensation should be simple and transparent.
Periodically, at the request of the
Committee, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. conducts a survey of director
compensation at other large U.S. companies and provides expert advisory support
to the Committee on the compensation of non-employee directors. Neither the
Company nor the Nominating and Governance Committee has any arrangement with any
other compensation consultant who has a role in determining or recommending the
amount or form of director compensation. Non-employee directors compensation
includes the following compensation elements:
Annual
Compensation  In May 2016, the Nominating and
Governance Committee considered a board compensation study prepared by Frederic
W. Cook & Co., Inc. After reviewing that study, the Committee recommended
and the Board approved an increase of $5,000 in the annual compensation for
non-employee directors from $280,000 to $285,000, effective January 1, 2016. All
of the $5,000 increase was allocated to an increase in the annual cash retainer
(from $120,000 to $125,000). The annual stock retainer of $160,000 remains
unchanged. Approximately 44 percent of the annual compensation (or $125,000) is
payable in cash in four quarterly installments and approximately 56 percent of
the annual compensation (or $160,000) is payable in common stock after the
Annual Meeting. In addition, the chair of the Audit Committee receives an
additional annual fee of $25,000 and the chair of the Compensation Committee
receives an additional annual fee of $20,000. The chairs of the Finance and Nominating and Governance Committees
each receive an additional annual fee of $15,000. The Lead Director receives an
additional annual fee of $30,000. There are no meeting fees. In lieu of the cash
fees, a director may elect to receive common stock of the Company. Non-employee
directors may also voluntarily defer all or part of their annual cash fees or
stock awards until they cease to be members of the Board.
Deferred
Stock  For directors who have elected to defer
their annual stock awards or annual cash fees into a common stock equivalents
account (Deferred Stock), the Company credits their accounts with a number of
3M common stock equivalents (including fractional share equivalents) equal to
the number of actual shares of 3M common stock which could have been purchased
with such deferred amounts on the first day of the calendar quarter, using the
closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on the last business day
immediately preceding such date. In addition, on each payment date for dividends
on 3M common stock, the Company credits to the directors accounts a number of
3M common stock equivalents having a value equal to the dividend, determined by
using the closing price of 3M common stock on the NYSE on the sixth business day
preceding the dividend record date. The Deferred Stock is fully vested upon
grant but does not have voting rights. Appropriate adjustments to the amount of
Deferred Stock shall be made to the accounts for stock splits, stock dividends,
merger, consolidation, payment of dividends other than in cash, and similar
circumstances affecting 3M common stock. The Deferred Stock will be distributed
in 3M common stock to non-employee directors beginning on January 1 of the year
following the year in which they leave the Board, either in a lump sum or in up
to ten annual installments pursuant to their deferral elections.
All Other
Compensation  The column below showing All
Other Compensation includes the incremental cost of complimentary products and
matching gifts. The non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the
Companys matching gift program on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this
program, the 3M Foundation will match up to a total of $5,000 a year in
contributions by the director to eligible institutions of higher
education.

AUDIT
COMMITTEEMATTERS
Proposal No. 2:
Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
for 2017
The Audit Committee is directly
responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of all fees),
retention, and oversight of the Companys independent registered public
accounting firm (Independent Accounting Firm) retained to perform the audit of
our financial statements and our internal control over financial
reporting.
The Audit Committee has appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to serve as 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm
for 2017. PwC has been 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm since 1998. Prior to
that, 3Ms Independent Accounting Firm was Coopers & Lybrand (until its
merger with Price Waterhouse in 1998). In accordance with SEC rules and PwC
policy, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number
of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to our Company.
For lead and concurring audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years
of service in that capacity is five years. The process for selection of the
Companys lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting
between the Chair of the Audit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well
as discussion by the full Committee and with management. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews
PwCs independence and performance in connection with the Audit Committees
determination of whether to retain PwC or engage another firm as our Independent
Accounting Firm. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers,
among other things:


●
PwCs historical and recent performance on the 3M audit,
      including input from those 3M employees with substantial contact with PwC
      throughout the year about PwCs quality of service provided, and the
      independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism demonstrated
      throughout the engagement by PwC and its audit team;

●
an analysis of PwCs known legal risks and significant
      proceedings;

●
external data relating to audit quality and performance,
      including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
      reports on PwC and its peer firms;

●
PwCs independence;

●
the appropriateness of PwCs fees, on both an absolute basis
      and as compared to its peer firms;

●
PwCs tenure as our independent auditor and its familiarity
      with our global operations and businesses, accounting policies and
      practices and internal control over financial reporting; and

●
PwCs capability and expertise
      in handling the breadth and complexity of our global operations, including
      the Companys phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning
      system on a worldwide basis over the next several
  years.
Based on this evaluation, the Audit
Committee believes that PwC is independent and that it is in the best interests
of the Company and our stockholders to retain PwC to serve as our Independent
Accounting Firm for 2017.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of PwC as our Independent Accounting Firm for 2017. Although ratification is not required
by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to our
stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. If the
selection of PwC is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it
is appropriate to select another Independent Accounting Firm. Even if the
selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may in its discretion select a
different Independent Accounting Firm at any time during the year if it
determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and
our stockholders.
PwC representatives are expected to
attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to appropriate
questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.



RECOMMENDATION
      OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

 



The Audit Committee of the Board
      of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the
      appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys independent
      registered public accounting firm for 2017. Proxies solicited by the Board
      of Directors will be voted FOR ratification unless a stockholder
      indicates otherwise in voting the
proxy.

Audit Committee
Report
The Audit Committee oversees the
Companys financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The
management of the Company is responsible for (i) the preparation of complete and
accurate annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements (financial
statements) in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States, (ii) maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting
principles and policies and internal controls designed to assure compliance with
accounting standards and laws and regulations, and (iii) an assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Independent
Accounting Firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) an
audit of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements and a review of
the Companys quarterly financial statements and expressing opinions on the
Companys financial statements and internal control over financial reporting

In this context, the Audit Committee has met and
held discussions with management and the Independent Accounting Firm regarding
the fair and complete presentation of the Companys results and the assessment
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee
has discussed significant accounting policies applied by the Company in its
financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has
represented to the Audit Committee that the Companys consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and
discussed the consolidated audited financial statements with management and the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the
Independent Accounting Firm matters required to be discussed pursuant to the
PCAOBs Auditing Standards on Communications with Audit Committees, as currently
in effect.
In addition, the Audit Committee has
reviewed and discussed with the Independent Accounting Firm the auditors
independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the
Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters required by
applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the Independent Accounting Firms
communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit
Committee has discussed the Independent Accounting Firms independence from the
Company.
The Audit Committee also has considered
whether the Independent Accounting Firms provision of non-audit services to the
Company is compatible with the auditors independence. The Audit Committee has
concluded that the Independent Accounting Firm is independent from the Company
and its management.
The Audit Committee has discussed with
the Companys Internal Audit Department and Independent Accounting Firm the
overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee
meets with the Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance Officer, the General Counsel,
and representatives of the Independent Accounting Firm in regular and executive
sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the
Companys internal controls, and the overall quality of the Companys financial
reporting and compliance programs.
In reliance on the reviews and
discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board
of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements
be included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, for filing with the SEC.

Audit Committee Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and
      Permissible Non-Audit Services of theIndependent Accounting
      Firm
The Audit Committee is responsible for
appointing and overseeing the work of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Audit
Committee has established the following procedures for the pre-approval of all
audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting
Firm. 
Before engagement of the Independent
Accounting Firm for the next years audit, the Independent Accounting Firm will
submit to the Audit Committee for approval a detailed description of services it
expects to render to the Company during that year for each of the following
categories of services:



●
Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation
      of consolidated financial statements, as well as work that generally only
      the Independent Accounting Firm can reasonably be expected to provide,
      including comfort letters, statutory audits, attest services, and
      consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting
      standards;

●
Audit-related services are for assurance and related services
      that are traditionally performed by the Independent Accounting Firm,
      including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions or
      dispositions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures
      required to meet certain regulatory requirements;

●
Tax services include all services performed by the Independent
      Accounting Firms tax personnel except those services specifically related
      to the audit of the financial statements, and include fees in the areas of
      tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice; and 

●
Other services are those
      services not captured in the other
categories.
Before engagement, the Audit Committee
pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and
the Audit Committee requires the Independent Accounting Firm to report actual
fees in comparison to the budget periodically throughout the year by category of
service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary
to engage the Independent Accounting Firm for additional services not
contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit
Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the Independent
Accounting Firm.
The Audit Committee has delegated
pre-approval authority to the chair of the Committee. The chair must report, for
informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee
at its next scheduled meeting.


Fees of the Independent Accounting
    Firm
The following table represents fees
billed for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC)
for the audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, and
fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during those periods.

EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION
Proposal No. 3: Advisory Approval of
Executive Compensation
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange
Act provides our stockholders with the opportunity to approve, on an advisory
basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this
Proxy Statement. This is the sixth year that the Company is asking stockholders
to vote on this type of proposal, known as a say-on-pay proposal. As required
by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, the Company anticipates providing
its stockholders with the opportunity at its 2017 Annual Meeting to cast an
advisory vote on the frequency with which stockholders will be offered the
chance to vote on future say-on-pay proposals.
We believe that our executive
compensation program is consistent with our core compensation principles and is
structured to assure that those principles are implemented. At the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders held on May 10, 2016, approximately 96 percent of the
votes cast on this issue voted to approve the compensation of the Companys
named executive officers as disclosed in last years Proxy Statement. Although
the vote was non-binding, the Compensation Committee believes this level of
approval percentage indicates that our stockholders strongly support our core
compensation principles and our executive compensation program, and we believe
our stockholders as a whole should support them as well. 
Thus, the Company is submitting to
stockholders the following resolution for their consideration and approval:

RESOLVED, that the stockholders
approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Companys Named Executive
Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation
disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (including in the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and
related narrative). 
As described in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M delivered another
year of strong financial performance in 2016. These results reflected the strong
performance of the Companys leadership team, including the Named Executive
Officers, which impacted their annual and long-term incentive compensation
earned during 2016. 
While the Board of Directors and the
Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of the voting on
this proposal when making future decisions regarding executive compensation, the
vote is not binding on the Company or the Board and is advisory in nature. The
Company currently holds advisory votes on the compensation of named executive
officers annually. Accordingly, the next such advisory vote is expected to occur
at the 2018 Annual Meeting.



RECOMMENDATION
      OF THE BOARD

 



The Board of Directors
      unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal for the reasons
      discussed above. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted
      FOR this proposal unless a stockholder indicates otherwise in voting the
      proxy.
2017 Proxy Statement  |  35

Proposal No. 4: Advisory Approval on
the Frequency of Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation
As required by Section 14A of the
Securities Exchange Act, the Company is providing its stockholders with the
opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency with which stockholders
will be offered the opportunity to cast future advisory votes on the
compensation of its named executive officers. Stockholders may choose from the
following alternatives: 1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years, or to abstain from voting on
this proposal. 
After careful consideration, the Board
of Directors recommends annual (1 Year) advisory votes on the compensation of
the Companys executives. It continues to believe that annual votes will provide
the clearest and most useful feedback from stockholders to the Company
and the Compensation Committee in this important
area, and will confirm the Companys commitment to frequent and transparent
communications with investors. 
Stockholders are not voting to approve
or disapprove of the Boards recommendation. Instead, stockholders have four
choices with respect to this proposal: 1 Year, 2 Years, 3 Years, or
Abstain. For the reasons discussed above, we are asking our stockholders to
vote for a frequency of 1 Year when voting on this proposal.
While the Board of Directors and
especially the Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results
of the voting on this proposal, the vote is not binding on the Company or the
Board and is advisory in nature.



RECOMMENDATION
      OF THE BOARD

 



The Board of Directors
      unanimously recommends a vote in favor of conducting an advisory vote on
      executive compensation every 1 year. Proxies solicited by the Board of
      Directors will be voted in favor of conducting an advisory vote on
      executive compensation every 1 year unless a stockholder indicates
      otherwise in voting the proxy.

Table of Contents
We believe that our ability to deliver
consistent results over time is reflected in our total stockholder return, which
was in the top one-third of our executive compensation peer group for the one-,
three-, and five-year periods ending on December 31, 2016. For additional
information, see Total Stockholder Return on page 40 of this Proxy
Statement.
Other noteworthy accomplishments
include the following:


●

Celebrated the grand opening of
      our new $150 million laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota;

●

Achieved 100 consecutive years of
      paying dividends to stockholders;

●

Awarded 668 patents in The United
      States and 3,770 globally, bringing the total to more than 109,000 patents
      awarded to 3M throughout its corporate history;

●

Returned $6.4 billion to
      stockholders via dividends and gross share repurchases; 

●

Improved our employment brand by
      earning recognition as the Top Dream Company in the 2016 Millennial
      Career Survey conducted by the National Society of High School Scholars;
      and

●

Continued progress on our three
      key levers: Portfolio Management, Investing in Innovation, and Business
      Transformation. 



Factors Creating Alignment
Between Pay and Performance
3Ms executive compensation program is
designed to maintain a strong alignment between corporate performance and
executive compensation by tying
incentive compensation to the achievement of performance metrics that we believe
increase the Companys long-term value. Highlights of the program
include:


●

A large portion of each
      executives target Total Direct Compensation (cash plus long-term
      incentives) is performance-based, varying from 90 percent for Chief
      Executive Officer Inge Thulin to a range of
      79-85 percent for the other Named Executive Officers; and

●

The incentive compensation
      opportunities provided to the Named Executive Officers are based on
      multiple performance-based metrics focused primarily on growth in revenue
      and earnings, increase in 3Ms common stock price, efficient use of
      capital, and free cash flow conversion.

Impact of Company Performance on Incentive Compensation
The Companys performance directly
impacted incentive compensation decisions and pay outcomes for our Named
Executive Officers as follows:
2016 Annual
Incentive Compensation
For the Named Executive Officers paid
on the basis of the Companys overall performance, the 2016 annual incentive
compensation payout (before any adjustment for individual performance) averaged
98 percent of the target amount. The payouts reflect our solid performance
against the goals established for 2016:


●

Local currency sales achieved 98
      percent of plan;

●

3M economic profit achieved 101
      percent of plan; and

●

3Ms 2016 economic profit
      represented 97 percent of its 2015 results.
Performance Share
Awards (Long-Term Incentive
Compensation)
The number of shares delivered pursuant
to the performance share awards issued to the Named Executive Officers for the
2014-2016 performance period equaled 123 percent of the target number of shares
awarded. The actual number of shares issued exceeded the target number of
performance shares awarded due to solid performance against the performance
goals established for these awards in February 2014, as shown below.

After considering the appreciation in
the price of 3Ms common stock over the three-year performance period, the value
of the 3M shares delivered to the Named Executive Officers in settlement of
these awards (determined using the closing price of a share of 3M common stock
on the NYSE for December 30, 2016) equaled 179 percent of the value of the
target number of performance shares subject to such awards (determined using the
closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for March 3, 2014, the
initial grant date of 2014 performance share awards).

Stock and Long-Term
Incentive Compensation
The performance of 3Ms stock has a
material impact on the amount of compensation actually realized by our Named
Executive Officers. Our stock ownership guidelines require covered executives,
including the Named Executive Officers, to own amounts of Company stock having a
value exceeding a specified multiple of their base salary. If the market price
of 3Ms stock declines, so does the value of the stock they own.
Similarly, stock options and other
long-term incentive awards held by our Named Executive Officers increase or
decrease in value along with increases and decreases in the value of 3Ms common
stock. The stock options and other long-term incentive compensation granted to
our Named Executive Officers during and in years prior to 2016 increased in
value as the closing price for a share of the Companys common stock on the NYSE
increased from $150.64 on December 31, 2015, to $178.57 on December 30,
2016.


Total Stockholder
Return
As reflected in the following table, 3Ms stock performance (annualized total
stockholder return of 11 percent over the
three-year period ending on December 31, 2016) continues to compare favorably with the
stock performance of the peer companies included in the Companys
executive peer group (for which the median total
stockholder return over the same three-year period was nine percent), as
described under Competitive Pay on page 46 of this Proxy Statement.

2016 Say
      on Pay
In 2016, approximately 96 percent of
the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named
executive officers as disclosed in last years Proxy Statement. Although the
vote was non-binding, the Committee believes this level of approval indicates
that stockholders strongly support our executive compensation programs and
policies. The Committee will consider the results
of this years say-on-pay proposal, as well as feedback from our stockholders,
when making future executive compensation decisions.
For information concerning our investor
outreach efforts, please refer to the section entitled Stockholder Outreach and
Engagement on page 17 of this Proxy Statement.


Noteworthy Compensation Actions for
  2016
During 2016, we implemented the
following changes with respect to our executive compensation program:
●Amended the definition of Retirement in our Annual Incentive
Plan and our 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan effective as of January 1, 2016, to
mean a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at
least 10 years of service. Prior to this change, the term Retirement meant a
termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with at least
five years of service. This change was made to better align the benefits of
long-term service to the Company with the commitment required to earn them. The
previous definition continues to apply to awards granted under our 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan before January 1, 2016.
●Recalculated the number of shares required to be beneficially
owned by our executive officers in order to maintain compliance with our stock
ownership guidelines, effective December 31, 2016.


Compensation Policies
      and Practices
Our compensation program is designed to
provide appropriate performance incentives and avoid compensation practices that
do not promote the interests of our stockholders.



WE DO
     
WE DO NOT


 



✓Maintain a strong alignment
      between corporate performance and compensation by having a majority of
      Total Direct Compensation consist of performance-based
      compensation.
✓Conduct an annual assessment to
      identify and mitigate risks in the design of our incentive compensation
      programs.
✓Have a comprehensive clawback
      policy.
✓Use an independent compensation
      consultant retained by, and reporting directly to, the
      Committee.
✓Limit the number and amount of
      executive perquisites.
✓Prohibit our executive officers
      from hedging or pledging 3M common stock.
✓Maintain robust stock ownership
      guidelines applicable to all of our executive
officers.

      to align executive compensation with the market.


✗Have employment, severance, or
      change in control agreements with any of our executive
      officers.
✗Provide tax gross-ups on
      executive perquisites.
✗Have agreements that would
      provide automatic single-trigger accelerated vesting of equity
      compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to any of our executive
      officers in the event of a change in control. 
✗Provide dividends or dividend
      equivalents on unearned equity awards. 
✗Reprice
      stock options without the approval of 3M stockholders, except for
      anti-dilution adjustments (such as adjustments in connection with a
      stock split, spinoff,
etc.)

SECTION II: How We Determine
      Compensation


Principles of Our Executive Compensation
      Program
3M believes that the compensation of
its executives should be closely tied to the performance of the Company, so that
their interests are aligned with the interests of long-term 3M stockholders.
Consistent with this philosophy, the following core principles provide a
framework for the Companys executive compensation program:


●
Total Direct Compensation should be competitive to attract the
best talent to 3M, motivate executives to perform at their highest levels,
reward individual contributions that improve the Companys ability to deliver
outstanding performance, and retain those executives with the leadership
abilities and skills necessary for building long-term stockholder
value;

●
The portion of Total Direct Compensation that is
performance-based and is, therefore, at risk should increase with the level of
an individuals responsibility;

●
The program should balance incentives for delivering
outstanding long-term, sustainable performance against the potential risk of
encouraging inappropriate risk-taking;

●
The metrics and targets for earning performance-based
incentives should be consistent with, and aligned to, increasing stockholder
value over the long term; and

●
Executives are most effectively motivated to build long-term
stockholder value when a significant portion of their personal net worth is tied
to the value of 3M common stock.


Roles and
      Responsibilities
The Company believes that a
collaborative process best ensures that compensation decisions reflect the
principles of our executive compensation program. Set forth below is a summary
of the roles and responsibilities of the key
participants that were involved in making decisions relating to the compensation
that our Named Executive Officers earned in 2016.

* During 2016, the Committee was
assisted by its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of
Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook). Other than the support that it
provided to the Committee, FW Cook provided no other services to the Company or
3M management, with the exception of independent advisory support to the
Nominating and Governance Committee on the compensation of 3Ms non-employee
directors so that valuation methodologies and peer groups are consistent with
those used for executives and other employees. During the year, the Committee
conducted an evaluation of the independence of Mr. Paulin and his firm
considering the relevant regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the NYSE listing standards. The Committee concluded that the services
performed by Mr. Paulin and his firm raised no conflicts of
interest.

3M pays each of its executives a base
salary in cash on a monthly basis. The amount of this base salary is reviewed at
least annually, and does not vary with the performance of the Company. Base
salaries are designed to compensate the
executives for their normal day-to-day responsibilities, and it is the only
component of their compensation that is considered to be fixed rather than
variable in nature.

3M provides its executives with annual
incentive compensation through plans that are intended to align a significant
portion of their Total Cash Compensation with the financial performance of the
Company and its business units. Each executive is assigned a target amount of
annual incentive compensation as part of his or her Total Cash Compensation, but
the amount of annual incentive compensation actually paid depends on the
performance of 3M and its relevant business units as well as the executives
individual performance.
3Ms AIP offers eligible employees an
opportunity to earn short-term incentive compensation based on three performance
metrics, which were weighted as indicated for 2016:


●
Local Currency Sales
      (of 3M or a business unit, as applicable) vs. plan for the current year
      (50 percent);

●
Economic Profit (of 3M or a
      business unit, as applicable) vs. plan for the current year (20 percent);
      and

●
3M Economic Profit vs. actual
      results for the prior year (30 percent).
The actual amount paid to an eligible
employee for a particular year may range from 0 percent to 200 percent of the
employees target amount for that year, depending on the performance of the
Company and its business units compared to the performance goals approved by the
Compensation Committee. The amount of annual incentive compensation paid to an
eligible employee also may be increased by up to 30 percent or be reduced by up
to 100 percent based on the employees individual performance during that year.
Individual performance takes into account both quantitative (financial results,
for example) and qualitative (market and economic
circumstances, for example) factors. In no event, however, may the total amount
paid to an eligible employee exceed 200 percent of the employees target amount
for the year.
In determining the amount of annual
incentive compensation paid to a Named Executive Officer, the Named Executive
Officers individual performance is considered based upon the annual performance
evaluation that Mr. Thulin, assisted by 3Ms Senior Vice President, Human
Resources, does for each Named Executive Officer (other than himself) and the
annual performance evaluation that the Compensation Committee (acting through
its Chairman) does for Mr. Thulin. These performance evaluations are done
according to 3Ms overall performance assessment and management processes, which
involve setting annual financial and non-financial goals and objectives for each
individual and then assessing the individuals overall performance against these
goals and objectives at the end of the year. While the annual incentive
compensation earned by most 3M executives is determined under the AIP, the
annual incentive compensation earned by 3Ms Named Executive Officers, as well
as the other senior executives whose compensation is decided by the Committee,
is determined under the Executive Plan approved by 3Ms stockholders at the 2007
Annual Meeting. A total of 18 senior executives participated in this Executive
Plan during 2016. This Executive Plan, which is intended to provide compensation
that is exempt from the $1 million annual deduction limit of Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code, provides performance-based compensation for which the
performance goal is the Companys Adjusted Net Income.
44  |  3M


Table of
Contents
Assuming the Company meets the Adjusted
Net Income goal, the Executive Plan provides the Committee with discretion to
determine the amount of annual incentive compensation paid to 3Ms Named
Executive Officers and its other senior executives. The Executive Plan
establishes a maximum amount of annual incentive compensation that may be earned
by each covered executive for a year (a percentage of the Companys Adjusted Net
Income for such year) and then the Committee
utilizes this discretion to pay each covered executive less than this maximum
amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since the Executive Plan was
first adopted in 2007, the Committee has rarely used this discretion to pay a
covered executive (other than our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than
the same amount such executive would have received had he or she been
participating in the broad-based AIP (including the individual performance
multiplier).

3M provides long-term incentive
compensation to its executives through an incentive plan approved by the
Companys stockholders. This is a typical omnibus-type plan that authorizes the
Committee to grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights, performance shares, and other stock awards to
employees of the Company. The Company provides its executives with this
long-term incentive compensation based on 3M common stock in order to
effectively motivate such executives to build long-term stockholder
value.
In determining the initial target grant
value of the stock options and performance shares provided to our Named
Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considers the individual
performance of our Named Executive Officers using the performance evaluations
described under Annual Incentive above.
Our Named Executive Officers also may
receive special equity awards on an ad hoc basis as new hires or for recognition
and retention, promotions, or other purposes.



Benefits
      and Perquisites
Our Named Executive Officers
participate in the same health care, disability, life insurance, pension, and
401(k) benefit plans available to most of the Companys U.S. employees.

They are also eligible to receive
certain additional benefits and perquisites that are provided for the
convenience (financial planning assistance, for example), financial security
(nonqualified deferred compensation plans and premiums for additional life
insurance coverage, for example), or personal security (travel on corporate
aircraft and home security equipment/monitoring, for example) of the executives.

Subject to a few exceptions (travel on
corporate aircraft, for example), 3M generally provides these additional
benefits and perquisites to all of our executives on a consistent basis, although the type of additional life insurance coverage
provided varies based on the date the executive was first appointed to an
executive position. Individuals first appointed to an executive position on or
before February 28, 2003, receive additional life insurance coverage that is
provided through a whole life insurance policy or a universal life insurance
policy. Individuals first appointed on or after March 1, 2003, receive group
term life insurance coverage.
These additional benefits are described
in the All Other Compensation Table. No tax gross-ups are provided on any of
these additional benefits and perquisites. The entire program applied to
approximately 100 members of senior management during 2016, including all of the
Named Executive Officers.

Competitive Pay
We compete for executive talent in a
global market. In order to ensure that we are providing Total Direct
Compensation that is competitive, the Committee annually conducts a rigorous
benchmarking process with the help of its independent compensation consultant,
FW Cook. During this process, the Committee considers available pay data for two
peer groups: an executive peer group and a survey peer group.
Executive Peer
Group
For 2016, the executive peer group
consisted of the 18 companies identified below (which remained the same as in
the previous year, except for the elimination of Covidien due to its merger with Medtronic), as recommended by the
Committees independent compensation consultant and approved by the Committee.
The companies in this executive peer group were selected because (1) their
performance was monitored regularly by the same market analysts who monitor the
performance of 3M (investment peers), and/or (2) they met criteria based on
similarity of their business and pay models, market capitalization (based on an
eight-quarter rolling average), and annual revenues.

The Committee periodically reviews the
composition of the executive peer group to determine whether any changes are
appropriate. At the recommendation of its independent compensation consultant,
the Committee replaced Parker-Hannifin Corporation with General Electric Company
in August 2016 to more closely align the composition of the executive peer group
with our investment peers. Following the completion of Tyco Internationals
combination with Johnson Controls and its related restructuring, the Committee
also replaced Tyco International with Johnson Controls International plc in January 2017, as recommended by the
Committees independent compensation consultant. These changes did not affect
2016 compensation decisions made by the Committee.
The Company receives pay data and
information on the executive compensation practices at the companies in 3Ms
executive peer group from Aon Hewitt and FW Cook.

Table of Contents
Survey Peer
Group
For 2016, there are approximately 170
comparator companies in the survey peer group. Although the number and identity
of the companies varies from year to year and from survey to survey, each of the
companies included in the survey peer group are either part of the Standard
& Poors 500 Index or have annual revenue
exceeding $20 billion. All of the companies in the survey peer group also
participate in one or more executive compensation surveys obtained from three
consulting firms (Aon Hewitt, FW Cook, and Willis Towers Watson). Pay data for
the survey peer group is statistically regressed to recognize the different
sizes of the comparator companies (based on annual revenues) as compared to the
size of 3M. The Committee does not review the identity of the companies in the
survey peer group.
How the Committee
Uses Competitive Pay Data
The Committee considers the pay data
from the Peer Groups as a reference point when establishing the target Total
Cash Compensation and the initial target value of long-term incentive
compensation to be provided to our executives in any given year. For each
executive, the Committee generally tries to set such amounts at or near the
median for the corresponding items of compensation provided to similarly
situated executives in the executive peer group. In situations where the
Committee believes that there is insufficient market data for one or more
positions, the Committee starts with the median amount for a similar position and adjusts that amount up or down (generally not
more than 15 percent) to arrive at a number that it uses as the median for
that position. The final target amounts established by the Committee for each
executive may vary (generally between 80 and 120 percent of the relevant median)
based on individual circumstances. When setting the target amounts for any
individual executive, the Committee may consider the breadth and complexity of
the executives duties and responsibilities, the scores assigned to the
executive for his or her leadership behaviors (e.g., customer focus, strategic
mindset, operational leadership), the financial and operational performance of
the business activities for which the executive is responsible, experience and
time in their current position, internal pay equity, individual performance, and
such other factors as the Committee determines to be appropriate. The pay data
for the survey peer group is used by the Committee to assess the reasonableness
of the benchmarking results for each executive position benchmarked, helping to
ensure that the Companys compensation objectives are being met.
The Committee
also uses information on the executive compensation practices at companies in
the executive peer group when considering design changes to the Companys
executive compensation program. Overall, the Company believes that use of this
information from the Peer Groups enables the Committee to create better
alignment between executive pay and performance and to help ensure that 3M can
attract and retain high-performing executive leaders.


Tally Sheets
The Committee periodically reviews a
report comparing the amounts of compensation actually received by the Companys
Named Executive Officers to the amounts reported in its annual proxy statement
and summarizing the compensation that would be owed to such individuals in the
event of the termination of their employment under various circumstances.
Reviewing this report helps the Committee better
understand the Companys potential obligations to the Named Executive Officers
following the termination of their employment. It also helps the Committee
better assess the risk of any of the Named Executive Officers leaving the
Company prematurely because the Company is not providing sufficient retention
incentives.


Tax Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue
Code prohibits a company from deducting compensation in excess of $1 million
paid in any year to any Covered Employee, but this limit does not apply to
performance-based compensation that meets certain requirements under Section
162(m). For this purpose, the term Covered Employee means our Chief Executive
Officer and each other Named Executive Officer whose compensation is reported in
the Summary Compensation Table for the preceding year by reason of being among
the three most highly compensated officers for that year, but does not include
the Chief Financial Officer. The Committee
continues to emphasize performance-based compensation for executives. However,
the Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a
compensation program that attracts, retains, and rewards the executive talent
necessary for the Companys success. Consequently, in any year, the Committee
may authorize compensation in excess of $1 million that is not considered
performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m). The Committee
recognizes that the loss of the tax deduction may be unavoidable under these
circumstances.

Say-on-Pay Advisory Approval of Executive
      Compensation
At our 2016 Annual Meeting, we
conducted an advisory vote of stockholders with respect to the compensation of
our named executive officers as disclosed in last years Proxy Statement.
Approximately 96 percent of votes cast on this item approved the compensation of
our named executive officers as disclosed in the 2016 Proxy Statement. While the
approval was advisory in nature, the Committee believes the outcome of this vote
serves as confirmation that an overwhelming
majority of our stockholders believe that the pay of the named executive
officers was appropriately aligned with the performance of the Company as well
as the interests of our stockholders. As a result, the Committee chose not to
make any changes in our executive compensation programs or policies or the
compensation of any Named Executive Officer based on the favorable outcome of
this vote.

SECTION III: How We Paid Our Named Executive Officers
      In 2016


2016 Base Salary and Target Total Cash
      Compensation
The Committee considers changes in the
base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation of the Named Executive Officers
at least annually. As part of its normal process to progress senior executives
to a level of compensation that is commensurate with their responsibilities, the
Committee also periodically considers adjustments to the base salaries and
target Total Cash Compensation of senior executives whose rate of pay is set
below the market median. All adjustments are made only after considering the
most recent compensation data available to the Committee for executives with
similar responsibilities at companies in the Peer Groups, each individuals
place in the salary range for his or her position, and the individuals job
performance.
At the time Mr. Gangestad and Mr. Roman
were appointed to their current positions, and consistent with our normal
process, each executive was given a base salary and target Total Cash
Compensation below the median for such elements paid to executives serving in
similar positions at companies in the Peer Groups. Since that time, the
Committee has periodically reviewed each executives performance and approved
increases that are intended to bring his base salary and target Total Cash
Compensation closer to the median. In January 2016, the Committee approved the
following increases in the base salary and target Total Cash Compensation shown
below for Mr. Gangestad and Mr. Roman.

As a result of these increases, Mr.
Gangestads and Mr. Romans target Total Cash Compensation was at or near 85
percent and 95 percent, respectively, of the median value of the corresponding
compensation provided to executives with similar responsibilities at companies
in the executive peer group.
In February 2016, the Committee
approved (and in the case of Mr. Thulin, the independent members of the Board of
Directors ratified) the increases in the base salaries and target Total Cash Compensation shown below for the Named Executive
Officers following completion of their annual performance evaluations. Mr.
Delgados and Mr. Vales increases were both based on a combination of strong
operational performance and market adjustment to bring their target Total Cash
Compensation closer to the median paid to executives serving in similar
positions at companies in the executive peer group.

2016 Annual
Incentive
During 2016, the Committee provided the
Named Executive Officers with the opportunity to earn short-term incentive
compensation under the Executive Plan. Each Named Executive Officers target
annual incentive for the year was equal to the difference between his or her
target Total Cash Compensation and annual base salary. Each of the Named
Executive Officers was assigned to an appropriate business unit (the entire
Company, in some cases) established under the AIP for the purpose of measuring
business performance during 2016 and converting
that performance into a payout based on the AIPs formulas. While none of the
Named Executive Officers are covered by the AIP, the Committee rarely uses its
discretion under the Executive Plan to pay the covered executives (other than
our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive
would have received had he or she been participating in the AIP (including the
individual performance multiplier).
The amounts payable under the AIP for
2016 were based on the following performance results for the Company and, as
applicable, the respective business units to which the Named Executive Officers
were assigned:

Since the Company satisfied the
Executive Plans performance objective by earning Adjusted Net Income of $5.05
billion for 2016, the plan authorized the Committee to approve payments of
annual incentive compensation to each Named Executive Officer equal to
one-quarter of one percent of such Adjusted Net Income ($12,625,000). As
explained above, however, the Executive Plan authorizes the Committee to pay
each covered executive less than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. At its meeting in
February 2017 and consistent with its past practice, the Committee approved (and
with respect to Mr. Thulin, the independent members of the Board of Directors
ratified) a payment to each executive equal to the amount such executive would
have received had he or she been participating in the broad-based AIP (including
the individual performance multiplier), as shown below.

Long-Term Incentives  2016 Annual
      Grants
After considering the most recent
long-term incentive compensation data available from companies in the Peer
Groups and after taking into account its evaluation of their individual
performance during 2015, the Committee approved (and in the case of Mr. Thulin,
the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified) the following target
compensation values for the Named Executive Officers 2016 long-term incentive compensation awards. For ease of
comparison, the following table also shows the target compensation values of the
Named Executive Officers 2015 long-term incentive compensation
awards.

Consistent with market practices at
companies in the Peer Groups, during 2016, the Committee chose to deliver
one-half of the initial estimated value of the annual long-term incentive
compensation awards provided to 3Ms Named Executive Officers in the form of
stock options and the remaining one-half in the form of performance
shares.
2016 Stock
Options
Stock options granted to the Named
Executive Officers in 2016 as part of their long-term incentive compensation
have the following features:


●

an exercise price equal to the
      closing price of a share of 3M common stock on the NYSE for the date of
      grant;

●

a ratable three-year vesting
      schedule; and

●

a maximum term of 10
      years.
2016 Performance
Share Awards
Performance shares awarded in 2016 will
result in the issuance of actual shares of 3M common stock to 3Ms Named
Executive Officers if the Company achieves certain financial goals over the
years 2016, 2017, and 2018. The number of shares of 3M common stock that will be
issued for each 2016 performance share is linked to the Companys performance as
measured by the criteria of Relative Organic Volume Growth (40 percent
weighting), Return on Invested Capital (20 percent weighting), Free Cash Flow
Conversion (20 percent weighting), and Earnings Per Share Growth (20 percent
weighting). These performance criteria were selected because they are aligned
with 3Ms operating plan and the financial objectives communicated to stockholders and the Committee believes that they are
important drivers of long-term stockholder value. Attainment of these four
independent performance criteria is measured separately for each calendar year
during the three-year measurement period, with each year weighted as follows:
2016  50 percent; 2017  30 percent; and 2018  20 percent. However, the
formulas by which the Companys performance is measured do not change over the
three-year performance period.
The actual number of shares of 3M
common stock that will be delivered at the end of the three-year performance
period ending on December 31, 2018, may be anywhere from 0 percent to 200
percent of the target number of performance shares awarded, depending on the
performance of the Company during the performance period. However, an executive
may forfeit all or a portion of such shares if he or she does not remain
employed by the Company throughout the three-year performance period.
For awards tied to the achievement of
performance goals over the years 2016, 2017, and 2018, the Committee approved
the following formulas for determining the number of shares of 3M common stock
to be delivered for each performance share awarded, with the total number of
shares actually delivered being the sum of the number of shares earned as a
result of the Companys achievement of each of the four financial goals. In the
event that the Companys performance as measured by any of these performance
criteria falls between any of the percentages listed below, the number of shares
of 3M common stock earned will be determined by linear interpolation.

The above formulas are not a
prediction of how 3M will perform during the years 2016 through 2018 or any
other period in the future. The sole purpose of these formulas, which were
approved by the Committee in February 2016, is to establish a method for
determining the number of shares of 3M common stock to be delivered for the
performance share awards described above. 3M is not providing any guidance, nor
updating any prior guidance, of its future performance with the disclosure of
these formulas, and you are cautioned not to rely on these formulas as a
prediction of 3Ms future performance.

Long-Term
      Incentives  All Outstanding Performance Share
  Awards
The Companys annual award cycle and
three-year performance periods result in an overlap of awards. For example, the
performance goals for 2016 performance share awards relate to the years 2016,
2017, and 2018. Similarly, the performance goals for 2015 performance share
awards relate to the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, and so on, as shown below.
Performance against the goals established for each award are measured separately
for each calendar year during the measurement period, with each year weighted as
shown below in parenthesis. The Committee believes this structure reduces
motivation to maximize performance in any one period by providing the highest
level rewards only by building sustainable long-term results.

      Governance


Stock Ownership
      Guidelines
The Company maintains robust stock
ownership guidelines that apply to all Section 16 officers of the Company and
are designed to increase an executives equity stake in 3M and more closely
align his or her financial interests with those of 3Ms stockholders. The
following table shows the stock ownership guideline for each Named Executive
Officer and their compliance status as of December 31, 2016:

* In accordance with the terms of
the stock ownership guidelines, the number of shares required to be beneficially
owned by each Named Executive Officer in order to maintain compliance was
recalculated as of December 31, 2016, using the closing price of a share of 3M
common stock on the NYSE for December 30, 2016. Although each of the Named
Executive Officers has until December 31, 2019, to acquire beneficial ownership
of any additional shares required as a result of the recalculation, each
individual beneficially owned a sufficient number of shares on December 31,
2016, to comply with the new ownership levels required.
The stock ownership guidelines provide
that the number of shares required to be beneficially owned by each covered
executive will be calculated using such executives annual base salary at the
time of his or her initial appointment to a Section 16 position and again at the
time of a position change from one multiple level to another multiple level, and
the fair market value of 3M common stock at that time. The number of shares
required to be beneficially owned also is recalculated every three years
measured from December 31, 2013, using their annual base salary and the fair
market value of 3M common stock at the recalculation date.
Each covered executive is expected to
attain beneficial ownership of the number of shares of 3M stock determined by
the guidelines within five years of his or her initial appointment to a position
covered by the guidelines or a position change from one multiple level to
another multiple level. The guidelines also provide that each covered executive
whose required level of ownership increases as a result of a periodic
recalculation will have three years from the recalculation date (or the balance
of the five-year period since the date of their initial appointment or latest
position change, if longer) to acquire beneficial ownership of any additional
shares required as a result of the recalculation. However, if a covered
executive is not making adequate progress to meet the required level of
ownership within the applicable time period, the guidelines provide that he or
she will be required to hold and not sell a sufficient number of the after-tax
3M shares received upon the next payout of performance shares to be on track to
satisfy the required ownership level.
For purposes of these guidelines,
shares owned directly by a covered executive or by members of the covered
executives immediate family, shares owned indirectly through a covered
executives account in the Companys 401(k) plan or another deferred
compensation plan, unvested shares of restricted stock owned by a covered
executive, and shares represented by unvested restricted stock units granted to
a covered executive are all considered to be beneficially owned by the covered
executive and are counted in determining attainment of the required beneficial
ownership level.
For more information concerning the 3M
stock ownership of the Named Executive Officers, see the section entitled
Security Ownership of Management beginning on page 72 of this Proxy
Statement.

Prohibition of
      Hedging and Pledging
The Companys stock trading policies
prohibit the Companys executive officers from (1) purchasing any financial
instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value
of the Companys common stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts,
equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds; (2) engaging in short sales related
to the Companys common stock; (3) placing standing orders; (4) maintaining
margin accounts; and (5) pledging 3M securities as collateral for a loan. All
transactions in 3M securities by directors and executive officers must be
pre-cleared with the Companys Deputy General Counsel.


Policy on
      Reimbursement of Incentive Payments
(Clawback)
The Companys Board of Directors has
adopted a policy requiring the reimbursement of excess incentive compensation
payments made to an executive in the event that 3M is required to make a
material restatement of its financial statements. This policy applies to all
senior executives of the Company including all of the Named Executive Officers.
This policy does not require any misconduct on the part of the covered executive
whose excess incentive compensation payment is being reimbursed. As long as the
Company is required to make a material restatement of its financial statements
that causes an incentive compensation payout to be higher than it should have
been, the Company may seek to recover the overpayment from all affected
executives irrespective of whether their conduct contributed to the need for the
restatement. The Company established this policy prior to the passage of the
Dodd-Frank Act, which establishes new requirements for such policies. Upon
issuance by the Securities and Exchange Commission of final implementing
regulations for the Dodd-Frank Acts requirements, the Company will make any
changes to its existing policy as may be required to comply with those
regulations.


Assessment of
      Risk Related to Compensation Programs
Based on the Companys recent
assessment, the Company has determined that none of its compensation policies
and practices is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company. To conduct this assessment, the Company completed an inventory of its
executive and non-executive compensation programs globally, with particular
emphasis on incentive compensation plans or programs. Furthermore, recent market
events have brought heightened attention to plan design, and whether the design,
oversight, and controls have the potential to create not only financial risk,
but reputational risk as well. As a result, we expanded the scope of our fiscal
2016 risk assessment to account for these evolving concerns. Based on this
expanded assessment, the Company evaluated the primary components of its
compensation plans and practices to identify whether those components, either
alone or in combination, properly balanced compensation opportunities and risk.

The Company believes that our overall
cash versus equity pay mix, balance of shorter-term versus longer-term
performance focus, balance of revenue versus profit focused performance
measures, stock ownership guidelines, and clawback policy all work together to
provide our employees and executives with incentives to deliver outstanding
performance to build long-term stockholder value, while taking only necessary
and prudent risks. In this regard, the Companys strong ethics and its corporate
compliance systems, which are overseen by the Audit Committee, further mitigate
against excessive or inappropriate risk taking. In addition, our employee sales
plans are designed under global guidelines, where oversight of plan terms,
administration, and operation is strong and governance roles are
segregated.
The Compensation Committee, with
assistance from its independent compensation consultant, George B. Paulin of FW
Cook, reviewed the Companys risk assessment and a separate risk assessment that
Mr. Paulin conducted for the Committee on the Companys executive compensation
policies and practices. Based on its consideration of these assessments, the
Committee concurred with the Companys determination that none of its
compensation policies and practices is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

Compensation Committee
Report
In accordance with the Securities and
Exchange Commissions disclosure requirements for executive compensation, the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of 3M Company (the Committee)
has reviewed and discussed with 3M Management the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis. Based on this review and these discussions with 3M Management, the

Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2017.
The amounts included in this column for the performance share awards made during
2016 are calculated based on the probable satisfaction of the performance
conditions for such awards. If the highest level of performance is achieved for
these performance share awards, the maximum value of these awards at the grant
date would be as follows: Mr. Thulin  $11,000,220; Mr. Gangestad  $3,124,134;
Mr. Roman  $2,163,402; Mr. Delgado  $2,563,972; and Mr. Vale 
$2,633,554.

statement reporting purposes. See Note 11 to the Companys audited financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, included in the
Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 9, 2017. There were no above-market earnings on deferred
compensation under the Companys nonqualified deferred compensation
programs.
(5) See the All Other Compensation
table below for details.
(6) No amounts are reported for Mr.
Roman for the years 2014 and 2015, or for Mr. Delgado for the year 2014, since

(1) The amounts shown reflect 3M
matching and additional automatic contributions under the tax-qualified 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan. All eligible
employees under this plan may receive 3M matching contributions on their pre-tax
or Roth 401(k) contributions to the plan on up to five percent of their eligible
pay. Eligible employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, also receive
additional automatic 3M retirement income contributions equal to three percent
of their eligible pay.
(2) The amounts shown reflect 3M
matching contributions under the VIP Excess Plan, a nonqualified defined
contribution plan. Eligibility for this plan and its matching contributions is
limited to employees whose compensation exceeds a limit established by Federal
income tax laws for tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The plan permits
eligible employees to save additional amounts from their current cash
compensation beyond the contribution limits established by Federal tax laws, and
to receive Company matching contributions similar to the matching contributions
provided under the tax-qualified 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan.
(3) The amounts shown reflect the
amount of premiums paid by the Company on behalf of each individual with respect
to their respective universal life or term life insurance policies obtained for
them under the Executive Life Insurance Plan.
(4) These amounts reflect fees for
personal financial planning and tax return preparation services paid by the
Company on behalf of each individual.
(5) This amount reflects the aggregate
incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Thulins personal use of corporate
aircraft during 2016. This aggregate incremental cost was calculated by
combining the variable operating costs of such travel, including the cost of
fuel, landing fees, parking fees, trip preparation fees, enroute communication
charges, enroute navigation charges, on-board catering, and crew travel
expenses. The Compensation Committee requires Mr. Thulin to use the corporate
aircraft for all business and personal travel.
(6) This amount reflects the
expenses incurred by 3M during 2016 for home security equipment and monitoring
services at the personal residence of Mr. Thulin.
(7) This amount reflects the
aggregate incremental cost to the Company for Mr. Thulins personal use of a
Company-provided automobile and local ground transportation. These costs include
lease payments for the vehicle, fuel, insurance premiums, repairs, and
maintenance.
(8) This amount reflects the
aggregate incremental cost to the Company for meals provided to Mr. Romans
spouse while accompanying the executive on a business trip at the Companys
request.


Grants of Plan-Based
  Awards
The following table reflects the
various equity and non-equity plan awards granted to the Named Executive
Officers during 2016. With the exception of the annual incentive compensation
earned by such Named Executive Officers under the Executive Annual Incentive
Plan, all of the awards referred to in this table were granted under the 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan.

(1) Abbreviations for the Type of
Grant: 16PS = 2016 performance shares; Option = stock options; AIP = annual
incentive.
(2) The amounts shown as the
Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards reflect the
target and maximum amounts that may be earned by each individual during 2016
under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. This plan establishes a maximum
amount of annual incentive compensation that may be earned by each covered
executive during a plan year (established for purposes of complying with Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code), which for each of the Named Executive
Officers was one-quarter of one percent of the Companys Adjusted Net Income for
2016, and then permits the Compensation Committee to pay each covered executive
less than this maximum amount based on such factors as it deems relevant. Since
the Executive Annual Incentive Plan was first adopted in 2007, the Compensation
Committee has rarely used this discretion to pay a covered executive (other than
our Chief Executive Officer) anything other than the same amount such executive
would have received had he or she been participating in the Companys
broad-based Annual Incentive Plan (see Elements of Target 2016 Total Direct
Compensation Annual Incentive portion of the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis in this Proxy Statement).
(3) The amounts shown as the
Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards with respect to 2016
performance shares reflect the threshold, target, and maximum number of shares
of 3M common stock that may be earned by each individual as a result of the 2016
performance shares granted to each individual during 2016 under the 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The actual number of shares of 3M common stock to be
delivered as a result of these performance shares will be determined by the
performance of the Company during the three-year performance period of 2016,
2017, and 2018, as measured against four performance criteria selected by the
Compensation Committee (Relative Organic Volume Growth, Return on Invested
Capital, Earnings Per Share Growth and Free Cash Flow Conversion). For more
information on these performance criteria and the formulas for determining the
number of shares of 3M common stock payable as a result of these performance
shares, please refer to the Long-Term Incentives  2016 Annual Grants portion
of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy
Statement.
(4) The amounts shown as the All
Other Option Awards reflect the number of shares of 3M common stock subject to
nonqualified stock options granted to each individual during 2016 under the 2008
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The options granted on February 2, 2016, were part of
the Companys annual grant of stock options to the approximately 6,000 employees
participating in the plan, and they vest in installments of one-third on each of
the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
(5) The exercise price for all stock
options granted under the Companys 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is set at the
closing price at which 3M common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange on
the option grant date.
(6) The amounts in the Grant Date
Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards column were determined in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic
718, Compensation  Stock Compensation, excluding the effect of estimated
forfeitures, and, in the case of performance share awards, are based upon the
probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions. Assumptions made in
the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 15 to the Companys
audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016,
included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2017.

* A portion of Mr.
      Thulins benefits will actually be paid by a pension plan maintained by
      the Companys subsidiary in Sweden (based on the years he was employed in
      Sweden before transferring to the United States), and the amount paid by
      this plan in Sweden will reduce the amount paid by the Employee Retirement
      Income Plan.
The Employee Retirement Income Plan
(ERIP) is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan maintained by 3M for
its eligible employees in the United States. Effective January 1, 2001, the
Company amended the ERIP to include a pension equity formula for (1) employees
hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily
elected the pension equity formula during the one-time choice election period in
2001. The ERIP was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009, meaning
that employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2009, do not participate
in the plan. Of the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Gangestad, Mr.
Roman, and Mr. Delgado participate under the non-pension equity formula of the
ERIP (the Portfolio I Plan), while Mr. Vale participates under the pension
equity formula of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Plan). Retirement benefits under
the ERIP are based on an employees years of service and average annual earnings
during the employees four highest-paid consecutive years of service. As applied
to the Named Executive Officers, earnings for purposes of the ERIP include base
salary and target annual incentive compensation. All benefits earned under the
ERIP by the Named Executive Officers will be payable in the form of life
annuities, unless an individual elects at the time their employment ends to
receive the entire amount of his or her earned pension benefits in the form of a
single lump-sum cash payment.
Under the Portfolio I Plan, employees
earn annual benefits payable at retirement generally equal to 1.15 percent of
their high-four average annual earnings multiplied by their years of service
plus 0.35 percent of their high-four average annual earnings in excess of a
Social Security breakpoint multiplied by their years of service (up to a maximum
of 35 years). The Social Security breakpoint is an average of the Social
Security taxable wage bases for each of the 35 years ending with the year each
employee qualifies for receiving unreduced Social Security retirement benefits.
Under the Portfolio I Plan, an employee may retire with an unreduced pension at
age 60 (61 or 62 for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively). If the
employees age and service at the time of retirement total at least 90 (91 or 92
for employees born after 1942 and 1959, respectively) the employee also would
receive a Social Security bridge payment until age 62. Mr. Thulin is eligible to
retire with unreduced early retirement benefits. Each of Mr. Delgado and Mr.
Roman are eligible to retire with reduced early retirement benefits, with the
reduction being equal to 5 percent of the pension otherwise payable for each
year that he retires prior to age 62. 
Under the Portfolio II Plan, employees
earn pension credits (from 3 percent to 12 percent) for each year of employment
based on their age and accumulated years 
64  |  3M



Table of Contents
of service under the plan. Once their
employment ends, these accumulated pension credits are multiplied by their
high-four average annual earnings and added to an amount determined by
multiplying one-half of these accumulated pension credits by their high-four
average annual earnings in excess of a Social Security integration level (70
percent of the Social Security taxable wage base in the year employment ends).
The sum of these two amounts is then converted into an annuity payable over the
lifetime of the employee using fixed conversion factors. The Portfolio II Plan
does not provide any subsidies for early retirement.
As a tax-qualified plan, the ERIP is
subject to a variety of limits that apply to both the amount of any employees
earnings that may be considered when determining the benefits earned under the
plan as well as the maximum amount of benefits that any employee may earn. The
Nonqualified Pension Plan is designed to provide
additional benefits to employees, including the Named Executive Officers,
affected by these limits. The amount of benefits earned under this Nonqualified
Pension Plan generally equals the amount of benefits an employee was not able to
earn under the ERIP as a result of the limits imposed by Federal tax laws. The
benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan are generally paid in the
form of a single lump-sum cash payment following the termination of their
employment (subject to any applicable delay under Federal tax laws). Current
employees were given a one-time opportunity during 2008 to elect to receive
their benefits earned under this Nonqualified Pension Plan in the form of a life
annuity following their retirement, and none of the Named Executive Officers
elected to receive their benefits in the form of a life annuity.


Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation
The following table reflects the
participation during 2016 by the Named Executive Officers in three nonqualified
deferred compensation plans offered by the Company. The Deferred Compensation
Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or until
retirement from the Company the receipt of base salary and the portion of their
annual incentive compensation paid in cash. The Performance Awards Deferred
Compensation Plan allows eligible employees to defer for a number of years or
until retirement from the Company the payout of their performance share or
performance unit awards under the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2016
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The VIP Excess Plan allows eligible employees to defer
until retirement from the Company the receipt of base salary and the portion of
their annual incentive compensation paid in cash. All three
plans generally allow the eligible employees to elect to receive payment of
their account balances in the form of either a single lump sum payment or in up
to ten annual installments. With the exception of deferrals of performance
shares under the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan, earnings are
credited to the amounts deferred under all three plans based on the returns paid
on the investment funds available to participants in 3Ms qualified 401(k) plan
or a fixed rate of return based on corporate bond yields (as selected by each
participant). Earnings are credited to the deferrals of performance shares under
the Performance Awards Deferred Compensation Plan based on the return on shares
of 3M common stock, including reinvested dividends.

FOOTNOTES TO 2016 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED
COMPENSATION TABLE
(1) With the exception of the
amounts contributed by Mr. Roman from the payout of his annual incentive earned
during 2015, all amounts contributed by these individuals during 2016 have
been included in the Summary Compensation Table as Salary, Stock Awards, or
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation earned in 2014, 2015, or 2016. Since Mr.
Roman was not a named executive officer for 2015, the Summary Compensation Table
does not reflect any of his 2015 annual incentive compensation from which this
contribution was made during 2016. 
(2) All amounts contributed by the
Company on behalf of these individuals during 2016 are included in the All
Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table.
(3) None of these amounts is
included in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation earned in 2016, since
none of the Companys nonqualified deferred compensation plans provide
above-market or preferential earnings.
(4) Includes the following amounts
that were reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for prior
years: Mr. Thulin  $9,364,341; Mr. Gangestad  $390,236; Mr. Roman  $0; Mr.
Delgado  $150,274; and Mr. Vale  $212,661.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in
      Control
As reflected in the Compensation
Discussion and Analysis portion of this Proxy Statement, 3M has no employment
agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers nor does it have any
severance or change in control plans or arrangements that would provide
severance benefits to any of the Named Executive Officers in the event of the
termination of their employment or a change in control of the Company. We also
do not have any agreements that would provide automatic single-trigger
accelerated vesting of equity compensation or excise tax gross-up payments to
any of our Named Executive Officers in the event of a change in control of the
Company. However, certain of the Companys executive compensation and benefit
plans provide all participants (including the Named Executive Officers) with
certain rights or the right to receive payments in the event of the termination
of their employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The terms
applicable to these potential rights or payments in various situations are
described below. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that
are generally provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated
employees of the Company upon the termination of their employment are not
described, including (a) accrued base salary; (b) annual incentive earned with
respect to completed performance periods; (c) retiree welfare benefits provided
to substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees, including retiree medical
benefits; (d) distribution of vested account balances under the Companys
qualified 401(k) plan; (e) accrued pension benefits under the Companys defined
benefit pension plans payable following an employees retirement or other
termination of employment (the amounts of these benefits earned by the Named
Executive Officers are reported in the 2016 Pension Benefits Table); (f) life
insurance benefits generally available to all salaried employees; and (g)
distribution of account balances under the Companys nonqualified deferred
compensation plans (the amount of these account balances of the Named Executive
Officers are reported in the 2016 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Table).
Rights and Payments Upon
Retirement
Following retirement (as
described below), the Named Executive Officers are entitled to
receive:


●
continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the
      Companys stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock
      options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the
      original term (up to 10 years) of such options;

●
for those Named Executive Officers whose initial appointment to
      a 3M executive position occurred prior to January 1, 2006, payment for all
      previously granted performance shares upon completion of the respective
      three-year performance period (prorated to reflect the portion of the year
      worked only with respect to the performance shares granted in the year of
      retirement) and based on actual performance; and

●
for those Named Executive Officers whose initial
appointment to a 3M executive position occurred on
or after January 1, 2006, payment for all previously
granted performance shares upon completion of the
respective three-year performance period (prorated to
reflect the portion of the three-year performance period
that occurred prior to the date of the Named Executive
Officers retirement) and based on actual performance.

For this purpose, the term Retirement
means a termination of employment with the Company after attaining age 55 with
at least 10 years of service (age 55 with at least five years of service for
awards granted before January 1, 2016).
Rights and Payments Upon
Termination Due to Disability
In the event of the termination of
their employment due to disability, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to
receive:


●
continued vesting of stock options previously granted under the
      Companys stock plans, and the opportunity to exercise vested stock
      options previously granted under such plans during the remainder of the
      original term (up to 10 years) of such options;

●
immediate vesting of all restricted stock units previously
      granted under the Companys stock plans; and

●
payment for all previously
      granted performance shares upon completion of the respective three-year
      performance period, based on actual
performance.
Rights and Payments Upon
Termination Due to Death
In the event of the termination of
their employment due to death, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to
receive:


●
immediate vesting of all
      unvested stock options and restricted stock units previously granted under
      the Companys stock plans, and the opportunity for the Named Executive
      Officers estate or beneficiaries to exercise all vested stock options
      during the two-year period following the date of death (but not beyond the
      original expiration date of any such stock
option);
2017 Proxy
Statement  |  67


Table of Contents


●
payment to
      the Named Executive Officers estate or beneficiaries no later than March
      15 of the year following the year in which the Named Executive Officer
      died for all previously granted performance shares (in the same amount as
      paid for the performance shares granted to other Named Executive Officers
      if the date of death occurs after the end of the three-year performance
      period for such shares, and at the lesser of the target value or such
      other amount as determined by the Committee in its discretion if the date
      of death occurs before the end of the three-year performance period for
      such shares); and

●
payment to the
      Named Executive Officers beneficiaries of the proceeds from the life
      insurance policies provided for such Named Executive Officer pursuant to
      the Companys Executive Life Insurance
Plan.
Rights and Payments Upon Termination
for Any Other Reason
In the event of the termination of
their employment for any reason other than retirement, death, or disability (and
other than in connection with a change in control, as described further
below):


●
the Named
      Executive Officers will have the opportunity to exercise vested stock
      options granted under the Companys stock plans within the first 90 days
      following the termination date (but not beyond the original expiration
      date of any such stock option), at which time any remaining vested stock
      options are forfeited; and

●
all unvested
      stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares granted to
      the Named Executive Officers are forfeited
  immediately.
Rights and Payments Upon a Change in
Control
If the Company terminates a Named
Executive Officers employment for Misconduct (for awards granted prior to May
10, 2016, without Cause) or if a Named Executive Officer resigns for Good Reason
within 18 months following a change in control event of the Company (as
defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), all of the
Named Executive Officers outstanding unvested stock options and restricted
stock units granted under the Companys stock plans will be immediately vested
and all of such Named Executive Officers outstanding performance shares will be
prorated and settled in accordance with the terms of the plan.
For purposes of our outstanding
long-term incentive awards, the terms Misconduct, Cause, and Good Reason
mean the following:
Misconduct means (i) the Named
Executive Officers willful failure to substantially perform his or her duties
(other than a failure resulting from his or her disability); (ii) the Named
Executive Officers willful failure to carry out, or comply with any lawful and
reasonable directive of the Board or his or her immediate supervisor; (iii) the
occurrence of any act or omission by the Named Executive Officer that could
reasonably be expected to result in (or has resulted in) his or her conviction,
plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere, or imposition of unadjudicated
probation for any felony or indictable offense or crime involving moral
turpitude; (iv) the Named Executive Officers commission of an act of fraud,
embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct, or breach of fiduciary duty against
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their officers,
directors, employees, customers, suppliers, insurers or agents; (v) the Named
Executive Officers material breach of any material provision of any written
agreement with the Company or any subsidiary; or (vi) any other intentional
misconduct by the Named Executive Officer that significantly affects the
business or affairs of the Company or any subsidiary in an adverse
manner.
Cause means a material violation of
any policy of the Company, or embezzlement or theft of property belonging to the
Company.
Good Reason means (i) a material
diminution in the Named Executive Officers position, authority, duties, or
responsibilities as in effect immediately prior to the change in control; (ii) a
material diminution in the Named Executive Officers base salary or annual
planned cash compensation; or (iii) a material change in the geographic location
at which the Named Executive Officer is required to perform services for the
Company.
The amounts payable to or on behalf of
each of the Named Executive Officers in each of the above situations (other than
amounts relating to payments or benefits generally provided on a
non-discriminatory basis to all similarly situated employees) is reflected in
the following table, assuming that each individuals employment had terminated
and/or a change in control of the Company had occurred on December 31, 2016. As
of December 31, 2016, Mr. Thulin, Mr. Roman, and Mr. Delgado were eligible to
retire (as that term is defined for purposes of 3Ms stock plans).

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL
Proposal No. 5:
Stockholder Proposal on Implementation of Holy Land Principles 
3M has received a stockholder proposal
from the Holy Land Principles, Inc., P.O. Box 15128, Washington, D.C. 20003, the
owner of 21 shares of 3M common stock (the Proponent). The Proponent has
requested that the Company include the following proposal and supporting
statement (in italics) in its proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if
properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponents qualified representative.
For the reasons set forth following the Proponents statement, your Board of
Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
American Principles Following
American Investment 
HOLY LAND PRINCIPLES 3M RESOLUTION 
WHEREAS, 3M has operations in Palestine/Israel; 
WHEREAS, achieving a lasting
peace in the Holy Land --with security for Israel and justice for Palestinians
--encourages us to promote a means for establishing justice and equality; 
WHEREAS, fair employment should be the hallmark of any American company at home
or abroad and is a requisite for any just society; 
WHEREAS, Holy Land Principles
Inc., a non-profit organization, has proposed a set of equal opportunity
employment principles to serve as guidelines for corporations in
Palestine/Israel.
These are: 


1.
Adhere to equal and fair employment practices in hiring,
      compensation, training, professional education, advancement and governance
      without discrimination based on national, racial, ethnic or religious
      identity.

2.
Identify underrepresented employee groups and initiate
      active recruitment efforts to increase the number of underrepresented
      employees.

3.
Develop training programs that will prepare substantial
      numbers of current minority employees for skilled jobs, including the
      expansion of existing programs and the creation of new programs to train,
      upgrade, and improve the skills of minority employees.

4.
Maintain a work environment that is respectful of all
      national, racial, ethnic and religious groups.

5.
Ensure that layoff, recall and termination procedures do
      not favor a particular national, racial, ethnic or religious
      group.

6.
Not make military service a precondition or
      qualification for employment for any position, other than those positions
      that specifically require such experience, for the fulfillment of an
      employees particular responsibilities.

7.
Not accept subsidies, tax incentives or other benefits
      that lead to the direct advantage of one national, racial, ethnic or
      religious group over another.

8.
Appoint staff to monitor,
      oversee, set timetables, and publicly report on their progress in
      implementing the Holy Land Principles.
RESOLVED: Shareholders request the
Board of Directors to: Make all possible lawful efforts to implement and/or
increase activity on each of the eight Holy Land Principles. 
SUPPORTING
STATEMENT
The proponent believes that
3M benefits by hiring from the widest available talent pool. An employees
ability to do the job should be the primary consideration in hiring and
promotion decisions. 
Implementation of the Holy Land
Principles--which are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian and pro-company --will
demonstrate concern for human rights and equality of opportunity in its
international operations. 
Please vote your proxy FOR these
concerns.

Table of Contents


Boards
      Statement Opposing the Proposal
After careful consideration, and for
the reasons set forth below, the Board believes it is not in the best interests
of 3M or its stockholders for the Board to adopt the Holy Land
Principles.


1.
3M already has established
      solidly its commitment to upholding human and workplace rights in all 3M
      operations. 3Ms Global Human Rights Policy statement, which was adopted
      in 2013, reinforces the Companys commitment to providing a workplace that
      is safe, healthy, free from violence, harassment, or discrimination, and
      compliant with applicable laws relating to wages, work hours, and work
      conditions. Similarly, 3M became a member of the U.N. Global Compact
      (UNGC) in early 2014, thereby committing to align our operations and
      strategies with the UNGC principles on human rights. While 3M has always
      acted in accordance with the core values represented by the UNGC, we
      remain proud to formalize our commitment to its 10 principles, including
      the areas of human rights, labor, and environmental, and to grow our
      partnership with the organization. 3Ms approach to managing and ensuring
      human rights aligns with 3Ms Code of Conduct, (available in various
      languages on our Company website, at
      www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/about-3m/), which recognizes the right of
      all employees globally to have a respectful workplace. Likewise, our
      commitment is embodied in 3Ms Human Resource Principles, which respect
      the dignity and worth of all individuals, encourage the initiative of each
      employee, challenge individual capabilities, and provide equal opportunity
      for development for all. Importantly, unlike the practices set forth in
      the Holy Land Principles, which emphasize only one area of the world, our
      commitments transcend a single area and apply to all our operations
      globally.

2.
Our Company also places great
      value on ethical conduct and sustainability around the world, with
      initiatives that far outreach the training and development guidelines
      identified in the Holy Land Principles. We have been recognized four years
      in a row by The Ethisphere® Institute as one of The Worlds Most Ethical Companies®
      (2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017). Our
      Sustainability goals, which can be found in our annual Sustainability
      Report on our Company website at
      www.3m.com/3M/en_US/sustainability-report/, and on which our progress is
      measured on an ongoing basis, include actions in support of the education
      and development of our employees and our communities. We will continue to
      invest in increasing access for people worldwide to science, technology,
      engineering, math, and business skills. We are committed to improving
      lives through investments in environment, health and safety programs, and
      to strengthening our pipeline of diverse talent in every region in which
      we operate as a core part of our sustainability strategy. We aspire to
      provide training to 5 million people globally on worker and patient
      safety. The ethical treatment of people inside and outside 3M is a clearly
      established priority for our Company.


3.
3M values diversity in the
      workforce and in the global markets and communities we serve. At 3M,
      diversity is essential to innovation. We are fortunate to have a global
      workforce, and we celebrate this diversity every day. It is an integral
      part of who we are as a company. We recruit, hire, retain, and advance the
      best talent globally, while offering an inclusive environment where each
      individual can be and give their best. 3M has formed strategic
      partnerships with many professional associations, colleges, and
      universities to help identify diverse, well qualified candidates. We
      actively support career enrichment opportunities for people from diverse
      backgrounds. We have a long history of providing financial and in-kind
      donations, including product donations and volunteer support, to
      diversity-targeted institutions and nonprofit organizations. Our
      community investments enhance community vibrancy by improving standards of
      living, preparing youth for success, supporting the arts, and contributing
      to global humanitarian relief efforts. In short, we believe that our deep
      commitment to diversity brings business, social, cultural, and economic
      benefits, and it is pervasive in all we do.
For all these reasons, the adoption of
the regionally focused Holy Land Principles and the administrative requirements
contained therein is unnecessary, burdensome, and not in the best interests of
3M or its stockholders.



RECOMMENDATION
      OF THE BOARD

 



The Board of Directors
      unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. Proxies solicited
      by the Board of Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a
      stockholder indicates otherwise in voting the
  proxy.

Information About the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
      Materials
Why did I receive a Notice of
Internet Availability of the proxy materials and not the printed proxy
materials?
The Securities and Exchange Commission
allows companies to furnish their proxy materials to stockholders over the
Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many of our stockholders a Notice of
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy
materials. In addition, we are providing the notice and proxy materials by
e-mail to some of our stockholders who previously consented to electronic
delivery of proxy materials. Those stockholders should have received an e-mail
containing a link to the Web site where the proxy materials are available, as
well as a link to the proxy voting Web site. All stockholders receiving the
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will have the ability to
access the proxy materials over the Internet and to request to receive a paper
copy of the proxy materials by mail. Instructions on how to access the proxy
materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in the
notice. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request to
receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or to access them electronically
in connection with future distributions of proxy materials. Distributing proxy
materials electronically conserves natural resources and reduces the costs of
printing and distributing our proxy materials.
Why did I receive a printed copy of
the proxy materials and not the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy
Materials?
We are providing some of our
stockholders, including stockholders who have previously requested to receive
paper copies of the proxy materials, with paper copies of the proxy materials
instead of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
How do I view the proxy materials
online?
Go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the
instructions to view the materials. You will need to provide the control number
printed in the box marked by the arrow located on your Notice of Internet
Availability of Proxy Materials (see example below  the information in the box
is an example only  your number will be different and is unique to
you).

What if I prefer to receive a paper
copy of the proxy materials?
You can easily request a paper copy of
the proxy materials (including the Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement,
and 2016 Annual Report) at no cost by using one of the three methods below. You
will need to provide the control number printed in the box marked by the arrow
located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (see example
above  the information in the box is an example only  your number will be
different and is unique to you).



●
By INTERNET at www.proxyvote.com;


●
By TELEPHONE, toll-free at 1-800-579-1639;
      or


●
By sending an E-MAIL to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com
    (simply        provide in the subject line the control number printed in the box marked        by the arrow from your Notice
    of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials;        no other information is  necessary).
Can I request to receive my Notice
of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by e-mail rather than by
mail?
You may request to receive proxy
materials for future meetings by e-mail via www.proxyvote.com or www.investordelivery.com
and follow the electronic delivery enrollment instructions. If you choose to
access future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail with
instructions containing a link to the Web site where those materials are
available and a link to the proxy voting Web site. Your election to access proxy
materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.

Please note that you MAY NOT USE your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to vote your shares; it is NOT a form for voting. If you return the
Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in an attempt to vote your shares, that vote will not count.

of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, please visit: www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters/e-proxy.shtml

Stockholders Entitled to
  Vote
Each share of our common stock
outstanding as of the close of business on March 14, 2017, the record date, is
entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought
before the meeting. As of that date, there were 597,596,831 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding.
Most 3M stockholders hold their shares
through a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee (which for simplicity we refer
to as a broker or other nominee) rather than directly in their own name. As
summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and
those owned beneficially:


STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD
     

If your shares are registered
      directly in your name with 3Ms transfer agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
      you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares and the
      Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or if you requested
      paper delivery, a copy of these proxy materials are being sent directly to
      you by 3M. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your
      voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting. You may
      also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in the Notice of
      Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading
      Voting Methods. 

BENEFICIAL OWNER
 

If your shares are held by a
      broker or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares
      held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you
      by your broker or other nominee who is considered the stockholder of
      record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to
      direct your broker or other nominee on how to vote and are also invited to
      attend the meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record,
      you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting, unless you obtain
      a legal proxy from the broker or other nominee. Your broker or other
      nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for you
      to use. You may also vote on the Internet or by telephone, as described in
      the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the
      heading Voting Methods. If you fail to provide voting instructions to
      your broker or other nominee, it will have discretion to vote your shares
      with respect to Proposal 2, but not with respect to Proposals 1, 3, 4, or
      5, as described below under Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and
      Approve Each of the Proposals Described in this Proxy Statement.
      

PLAN ACCOUNTS


If your shares are held in your
      account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
      Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of
      these shares and the trustee of the plans is considered the stockholder of
      record. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock
      Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may direct the trustee on how to
      vote the shares allocated to their account via the Internet, by telephone,
      or by signing and submitting the proxy card as described in the Notice of
      Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and below under the heading
      Voting Methods. Participants in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and
      Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan may also direct the
      trustee how to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares of common
      stock for which it has not received direction by following the same voting
      instructions. If you fail to direct the trustee how to vote your shares by
      following these instructions, the trustee will vote your shares as
      described in the proxy card.


Proposals you are Asked to Vote on and the Boards Voting
      Recommendations
The following proposals are included in
this Proxy Statement and are scheduled to be voted on at the meeting. 3Ms Board

Other than the proposals described in
this Proxy Statement, the Board is not aware of any other matters to be
presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy by telephone,
Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the persons
appointed by the Board as proxy holders  Nicholas C. Gangestad, Gregg M.
Larson, and Inge G. Thulin  will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly
presented for a vote at the meeting. If any of our nominees is unavailable as a
candidate for director, the above-named proxy holders will vote your proxy for
another candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board of
Directors.


Voting Requirements to Elect Directors and Approve Each
      Of The Proposals Described In This Proxy
  Statement


QUORUM
     

The presence of the holders of a
      majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the
      Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to
      constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as
      present for purposes of determining a quorum. As discussed below, a
      broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for
      a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the
      broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that
      proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial
      owner.

BROKER VOTING
 

Under New York Stock Exchange
      (NYSE) rules, brokers have discretionary authority to vote their
      clients shares in routine matters (including Proposal 2, the
      ratification of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm)
      so long as the beneficial owner of those shares did not provide voting
      instructions to the broker at least ten days before the stockholder
      meeting. Director elections, stockholder proposals, and executive
      compensation matters, including say-on-pay proposals and the equity
      compensation plan, are not considered routine matters for these
      purposes. As a result, if you do not provide your broker with instructions
      as to how to vote your shares, your broker will be prohibited from voting
      on Proposals 1, 3, 4, and 5, resulting in a broker non-vote with respect
      to those proposals.
If you are a beneficial owner
      (other than as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and
      Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan), your broker or
      other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting
      firm for 2017, even if it does not receive voting instructions from
      you.

ELECTION OFDIRECTORS
     

In accordance with 3Ms Bylaws, each director is elected
      by the vote of the majority of votes cast (which means the number of votes
      cast for a directors election exceeds the number of votes cast
      against that directors election, with abstentions and broker
      non-votes not counted as a vote cast either for or against that
      directors election) with respect to that directors election at any
      meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.
      However, if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be
      elected (a Contested Election) as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the
      date the Company first mails its notice of the meeting to its
      stockholders, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of
      the votes cast (which means that the nominees who receive the most
      affirmative votes will be elected to serve as directors).
For an election where the majority vote standard applies,
      the Nominating and Governance Committee has established procedures under
      which any incumbent director who is not elected shall offer to tender his
      or her resignation to the Board. In the event an incumbent director fails
      to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a
      Contested Election, the Nominating and Governance Committee, or such other
      committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall make a
      recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject
      the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should
      be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into
      account the Committees recommendation, and publicly disclose (by issuing
      a press release and filing appropriate disclosure with the Securities and
      Exchange Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and, if such
      resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision within ninety
      (90) days following certification of the election results. The Nominating
      and Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of
      Directors in making its decision each may consider any factors and other
      information that they consider appropriate and relevant. 
An incumbent director who fails to receive a majority of
      the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election (as defined
      above) and who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the procedures
      described above shall remain active and engaged in Board activities while
      the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board decide whether to
      accept or reject such resignation, or whether other action should be
      taken. However, it is expected that such incumbent director shall not
      participate in any proceedings by the Nominating and Governance Committee
      or the Board regarding whether to accept or reject such directors
      resignation, or whether to take other action with respect to such
      director.
If the Board of Directors accepts a directors
      resignation, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee
      is not an incumbent director, then the Board of Directors may fill the
      resulting vacancy pursuant to the Bylaws.

ALL OTHERPROPOSALS
 
The
      affirmative FOR vote of a majority of those shares present in person or
      represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is
      required to approve Proposals 2, 3, and 5. Proposal 4, with multiple
      choices, is subject to a plurality vote standard. In tabulating the voting
      result for any particular proposal, abstentions and, if applicable,
      broker non-votes are not counted as votes FOR or AGAINST the
      proposal. An abstention will, however, be counted as entitled to vote on a
      proposal and will, therefore, have the effect of a vote
    AGAINST.


Voting Methods
If you hold shares directly as the
stockholder of record, you may vote by granting a proxy or by voting in person
at the Annual Meeting by requesting a ballot. If you hold shares beneficially in
street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or
other nominee or in person at the Annual Meeting by requesting a legal proxy
from your broker or other nominee. If you own shares beneficially as a
participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to
the trustee. In most instances, you will be able
to do this over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Even if you plan to
attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as
described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to
attend the Annual Meeting. 
Please refer to the summary
instructions below and those included on your Notice of Internet Availability of
Proxy Materials or proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting
instruction card provided by your broker or other nominee.

Counting the
Vote
In the election of directors, you may
vote FOR or AGAINST one or more of the nominees or you may ABSTAIN.
Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For
Proposals 2, 3, and 5, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN, but please
note that abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST. Proposal 4,
with multiple choices, is subject to a plurality vote standard. If you sign your
proxy card or broker voting instruction card but provide no voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance
with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account in the 3M
Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings
Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in Stockholders Entitled to
Vote beginning on page 77.
Representatives of Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspectors of
election.


Confidentiality
The Companys Board of Directors has a
policy that all stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations that identify
stockholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document will be
available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder will not
be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow the inspectors of election to certify the results of the
stockholder vote. The policy also provides that inspectors of election for
stockholder votes must be independent and cannot be employees of the Company.
Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card that may
be forwarded to 3M management.


Results of the
Vote
We will issue a press release
announcing the preliminary voting results for items of business properly
presented at the meeting and will disclose the results for those items in a
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days of the Annual Meeting
date. The press release with voting results will also be available on our Web
site at www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml.


Delivery of Documents to Stockholders Sharing an
      Address
Securities and Exchange Commission
rules allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement
to any household not participating in electronic proxy material delivery at
which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the stockholders are
members of the same family (a practice called householding). We believe that
householding benefits both you and the Company by eliminating duplicate mailings
to stockholders living at the same address and by reducing our printing and
mailing costs. Each stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card
or voting instruction card. 
Your household may have received a
single set of proxy materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy
now or in future years, please request a duplicate set by calling
1-800-579-1639, by going to www.proxyvote.com, by e-mailing
sendmaterial@proxyvote.com, or by writing to 3M Company, c/o Broadridge, 51
Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Alternatively,
if your household received multiple sets of proxy materials this year, and
members of your household who are entitled to receive proxy materials would all
prefer to receive only a single set of proxy materials, you may submit such a
request as specified in the preceding sentence. 
If a broker or other nominee holds your
shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain brokers
will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing stockholders to consent to
such elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does not request
continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and nominees may offer
stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate duplicate mailings, you may
need to contact your broker or other nominee directly to discontinue duplicate
mailings to your household.

solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson
Shareholder Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy
materials and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder
Communications, Inc. a fee of $20,000 plus expenses for these services. We will
also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries

Alternatively,
stockholders intending to present a proposal at next years Annual Meeting
without having it included in the Companys Proxy Statement must comply with the

November 22, 2017, and no later than the close of business on December 22, 2017.
The notice must contain the information required by our Bylaws.

(a) Free cash flow and free cash
flow conversion are not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, they should not be
considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with
U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating
activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be
inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary
expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow
divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow
and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they function as
useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an
indication of the strength of the Company and its ability to generate
cash.

net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax
interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The
Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder
value creation.
