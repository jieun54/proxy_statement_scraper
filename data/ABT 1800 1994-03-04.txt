ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES

The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 29,
1994 at the corporation's headquarters, One Abbott Park Road, at the
intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. The
corporation will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and
may enlist the help of banks and brokerage firms in soliciting proxies from
their customers. The corporation will reimburse these institutions for
out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited by mail or in person by
directors, officers, or employees of the corporation and its subsidiaries. The
corporation has also retained Georgeson & Company Inc. to aid in the
solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $10,000 plus reimbursement for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE

Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 2, 1994 will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of January 31,
1994, the corporation had 819,811,254 outstanding common shares, which are the
only outstanding voting securities.

- --------------------------------------------------

VOTING OF PROXIES

A shareholder may vote in person, by a duly executed proxy, or through an
authorized representative. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize
no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies
may be revoked at any time prior to the meeting. This may be done by written
notice delivered to the secretary of the corporation, or by signing and
delivering a proxy with a later date.

All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected.

Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive
to elect the 13 nominees hereinafter named. These shares may be voted
cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than
the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee become unavailable to
serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the board of
directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy
holders, such action is necessary or desirable.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against ratification of Arthur
Andersen & Co. as auditors, the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, or
either or both of the shareholder proposals, or has abstained on these matters,
the shares represented by the proxy will be voted as specified. Where no choice
has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR ratification of Arthur Andersen
& Co. as auditors, FOR the amendment of the Articles of Incorporation, and
AGAINST both shareholder proposals. A proxy may indicate that all or a portion
of the shares represented by such proxy are not being voted with respect to a
particular matter. This could occur, for example, when a broker or bank is not
permitted to vote stock held in street name on certain matters in the absence of
instructions from the beneficial owner of the stock. These "non-voted shares"
will be considered shares not present and entitled to vote on such matter,
although such shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other
purposes and will count for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on
any matter to be decided at the meeting.

The affirmative vote by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding common
shares entitled to vote at the meeting is required for adoption of the proposal
to amend the Articles of Incorporation. With respect to all other matters, a
favorable vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and
entitled to vote on these matters are required for approval. Abstentions and
withheld votes have the effect of votes against all of these matters.

The board of directors is not aware of any other issue to be brought before the
meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the
accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy
holders.

- --------------------------------------------------

INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY OWNERSHIP

Laboratories, One Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500, held

the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan. The trustees of the Stock
Retirement Trust are G. P. Coughlan, T. C. Freyman, and E. M. Walvoord, officers
of the corporation. The trustees share voting power with respect to the shares
owned by the Trust. The trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions
from the participants if the trustees determine that a matter to be voted on at
a shareholder meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The
individual participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by
the terms of the Trust. The Trust Agreement is of unlimited duration.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The board of directors, which held six meetings in 1993, has four committees
established in the corporation's bylaws: the executive committee, audit
committee, compensation committee, and nominations committee.

The executive committee, whose members are D. L. Burnham, chairman, H. L.
Fuller, W. D. Smithburg, J. R. Walter, and W. L. Weiss, held one meeting in
1993. This committee may exercise all the authority of the board in the
management of the corporation except for matters expressly reserved by law for
board action.

The audit committee, whose members are J. R. Walter, chairman, K. F. Austen, H.
L. Fuller, The Lord Hayhoe PC, A. F. Jacobson, and W. L. Weiss, held two
meetings in 1993. This committee provides advice and assistance regarding
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices of the corporation. Each
year, it recommends to the board a firm of independent public accountants to
serve as auditors. The audit committee reviews with such auditors the scope and
results of their audit, fees for services, and independence in servicing the
corporation. The committee also meets with the corporation's internal auditors
to evaluate the effectiveness of the work they perform.

The compensation committee, whose members are W. D. Smithburg, chairman, H. L.
Fuller, A. F. Jacobson, D. A. Jones, B. Powell, Jr., A. B. Rand, W. A. Reynolds,
and J. R. Walter, held five meetings in 1993. This committee is responsible for
setting and administering the policies and programs that govern both annual
compensation and stock ownership programs.

The nominations committee, whose members are W. A. Reynolds, chairman, K. F.
Austen, D. A. Jones, B. Powell, Jr., A. B. Rand, W. D. Smithburg, and W. L.
Weiss, held two meetings in 1993. This committee develops general criteria
regarding the qualifications and selection of board members and officers, and
recommends candidates for such positions to the board of directors. A
shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for director or directly
nominate persons for director by complying with the procedures on pages 15 and
16.

The average attendance of all directors at board and committee meetings in 1993
was 97 percent.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Report of the Compensation Committee

The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.

The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:

    - Integrates compensation programs with both the corporation's annual and
      long-term strategic planning and measurement processes.

    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.

    - Helps attract and retain key executives critical to the long-term success
      of the corporation.

The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.

The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies include the majority of companies in the Standard and
Poor's Healthcare Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies
chosen for size and performance comparability to the corporation is used as a
secondary source of comparison.

Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements, base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.

In 1993, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.

Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves.

The Abbott Management Incentive Plan is designed to reward executives when the
corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's area
of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial
elements such as profitability, total sales, and earnings per share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Among these goals the committee
gives particular weight to the achievement of overall profitability and earnings
per share targets as documented in the corporation's business plans.

The corporation has provided forms of equity participation as a key part of its
total program for motivating and rewarding executives and managers for many
years. Grants of stock options and restricted stock have provided an important
part of the equity link to shareholders. Through these vehicles, the corporation
has encouraged its executives to obtain and hold the corporation's stock.

Targeted award ranges for stock options and restricted stock opportunities are
determined taking into account competitive marketplace practice. Actual
individual awards are determined based on the established competitive target and
individual performance. The committee considers the amounts of options and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7

restricted stock previously granted and the aggregate size of current awards in
deciding to award additional options and restricted stock.

The committee believes that equity participation helps create a long-term
partnership between management/ owners and other shareholders. The policy of
granting stock options on a regular basis and encouraging stock ownership has
played a strong part in retaining an excellent team of executives and managers.
As reflected in the corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in
1993 included 7.1% growth in sales, and 15.0% growth in earnings per share. This
performance is in the upper range of performance level among peer companies. In
light of this performance and competitive evaluation, the committee determined
to grant Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a
2.8% increase in base salary, a 6.2% increase in bonus, a restricted stock award
and stock option grants.

Preliminary regulations interpreting The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 were issued in late December, 1993. The committee intends during 1994 to
review the impact of this act on the corporation's executive remuneration once
final regulations are issued.

(1) Limited stock appreciation rights have been granted in tandem with these
    options.

(2) One-third of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one
    year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years.

(3) The dollar amounts under these columns are the result of calculations at the
    5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and,
    therefore, are not intended to forecast possible future appreciation, if
    any, of the stock price.
(4) Amounts were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 1993
    of 821,129,684 and December 31, 1993 closing market price of $29.625 per

Annuity Retirement Plan

The corporation and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan
known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees
in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on
service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120
months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are offset for Social Security benefits.

The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis and include Social Security off-sets and supplemental benefits
under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan. The supplemental pension plan
provides benefits not available under the Annuity Retirement Plan. The
compensation considered in determining the pensions payable to the named
officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the
Summary Compensation Table on page 8.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. Pensions accrued under the
Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through a trust known as the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all participants
in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan
with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts
established on behalf of the participants in that plan. During 1993, the
following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such
individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: D. L. Burnham,
$1,279,254; T. R. Hodgson, $1,119,675; P. N. Clark, $51,271; and D. A. Thompson,
$446,871. As of December 31, 1993, the years of service credited under the Plan
for the named officers were as follows: D. L. Burnham - 11; T. R. Hodgson - 21;
P. N. Clark - 9; G. P. Coughlan - 3; and D. A. Thompson - 22.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compensation of Directors

Employees of the corporation are not compensated for serving on the board or on
board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each
month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as chairman of a
board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee).

Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, or deferred (as a
non-funded obligation of the corporation or paid into a secular trust
established by the director) until payments commence (generally at age 65 or
upon retirement from the board of directors). If the fees are deferred, the
director may elect to have the fees credited to a stock equivalent account under
which the fees accrue the same return they would have earned if invested in
common shares of the corporation. Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees
not credited to a stock equivalent account.

Under the Plan, the corporation may grant a director who retires from the board
a retirement benefit, and such benefit will be payable to the surviving spouse
of any director who dies while serving as a director. The retirement benefit
consists of payment of an amount equal to the monthly director's fee in effect
on the date the director retires (or, for a director who dies, the fee in effect
on the date of death) for a period equal to his or her service on the board to a
maximum of 120 months. In return for the retirement benefit, the director agrees
to provide consulting services to the board.

In 1993, each non-employee director was granted a restricted stock award of 790
shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination, retirement from the
board, death, or a change in control of the corporation. The non-employee
directors are entitled to vote the shares and receive all dividends paid on the
shares.

K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services during 1993 for the
corporation under a consulting agreement. The consulting agreement provides that
the fees he earns under the agreement may receive the same treatment as fees
earned under the Abbott Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. Dr.
Austen served as Chairman of the corporation's Scientific Advisory Council until
March 31, 1993 and provided consultation in the areas of research and
development, new technology and immunopharmacology throughout 1993. In 1993, Dr.
Austen received $50,000 for his consulting services.

COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

The corporation believes that during 1993 its officers and directors complied
with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 except as described below. Thomas R. Hodgson, an officer of the
corporation, filed late Initial Statements of Beneficial Ownership of Securities
for two trusts of which he is the trustee (reporting the trusts' ownership of
1,440 shares and 960 shares, respectively). A third party gave these shares to
these two trusts. The gift of these 960 shares to one of these two trusts was
also reported late by Mr. Hodgson on his Annual Statement of Beneficial
Ownership of Securities. Gary R. Byers, an officer of the corporation, corrected
an error made on his Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities
form by increasing by 68 shares the number of shares shown as owned on that
Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities form.

- --------------------------------------------------

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (ITEM NO. 2 ON PROXY CARD)

The bylaws of the corporation provide that, upon the recommendation of the audit
committee, the board of directors shall appoint annually a firm of independent
public accountants to serve as auditors, and that such appointment shall be
submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The board
has appointed Arthur Andersen & Co. to act as auditors for the current year.
This firm has served as auditors of the corporation since 1963. The board of
directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the selection of Arthur Andersen
& Co. as independent public accountants for 1994.

Representatives of Arthur Andersen & Co. are expected to be present at the
Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they
desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate
questions.

- --------------------------------------------------

AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION CONCERNING LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION
(ITEM NO. 3 ON PROXY CARD)

In 1993 the Illinois legislature adopted an amendment to the Illinois Business
Corporation Act (the "Illinois Act") that is similar to amendments adopted to
the Delaware General Corporation Law in 1986. This amendment to the Illinois Act
allows the limitation of personal liability of directors to the corporation and
its shareholders for monetary damages in certain circumstances, and makes
changes in the procedure for directors, officers and employees of the
corporation to obtain indemnification from the corporation.

The board of directors recommends that the corporation's Articles of
Incorporation be amended to (a) limit the personal liability of directors to the
corporation and its shareholders for monetary damages, as permitted by the
amendment to the Illinois Act, and (b) change the procedure with respect to
advancement and repayment of litigation expenses of persons covered under the
indemnification provisions of the Articles of Incorporation. Article R-VI of the
Articles of Incorporation, as it is proposed to be amended, is set forth in full
in Exhibit A attached hereto.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Consistent with the 1993 amendment to the Illinois Act, the proposed amendment
to Article R-VI provides that directors will not be personally liable to the
corporation or its shareholders for monetary damages except in the case of: (a)
breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its shareholders,
(b) acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or
knowing violation of the law, (c) illegal payment of dividends and certain
illegal acts in connection with a dissolution of the corporation, or (d) any
transaction in which the director derived an improper personal benefit. The
effect of the proposed amendment to Article R-VI is to absolve directors from
monetary liability to the corporation or its shareholders for breach of the duty
of care, even if the breach involved gross negligence.

The proposed amendment to Article R-VI does not limit the liability of directors
for acts or omissions occurring before its adoption. The amendment applies only
to the monetary liability of directors arising from a breach of their fiduciary
duty to the corporation or its shareholders in connection with their acts or
omissions as a director and not to liability arising in other capacities such as
an officer. The amendment does not limit the director's liability to parties
other than the corporation or its shareholders or liabilities under any other
law, including the federal securities laws, or the ability of the corporation
and its shareholders to seek equitable relief for a breach of fiduciary duty.

Adoption of the proposed amendment will make the corporation's standard for
director's liability consistent with the prevailing standard for director
liability and the standard applicable to most other publicly-held corporations.
The board of directors also believes that the limitation of personal liability
as provided in the

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              12

amendment will enhance the director's decision-making process by encouraging
entrepreneurial decisions which may be in the best interests of the corporation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13

CHANGES IN INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE

The proposed amendment to Article R-VI also makes certain changes in the
procedure for obtaining indemnification from the corporation.

Consistent with the 1993 amendment to the Illinois Act, the amendment provides
for advancement of litigation expenses without prior approval of the board of
directors, but upon receipt of an undertaking by the person receiving the
advance to repay the amount of the advance if it shall ultimately be determined
that he or she is not entitled to indemnification.

Under prior law, a corporation could advance litigation expenses to the person
entitled to indemnification prior to ultimate disposition of the case, provided
the board of directors approved each such advance and the person entitled to
indemnification submitted an undertaking agreeing to repay the advance unless
that person proved that he or she was entitled to indemnification. The amendment
to the Illinois Act dispensed with the requirement of prior approval of each
advance and shifted the burden to the corporation to prove that the person
receiving the advance was not entitled to indemnification.

Since the corporation's present directors and officers will benefit from the
added protection of the amendment, they have a personal interest in its
adoption. The changes made to the procedure with respect to advancement and
repayment of litigation expenses will apply to proceedings commenced before or
after adoption of the amendment, including a pending shareholder derivative
action relating to alleged improper marketing practices with respect to the
corporation's infant formula products in which all present directors (other than
Allen F. Jacobson) and Lael F. Johnson, an officer, of the corporation have been
made defendants. As of January 31, 1994 the corporation has advanced litigation
expenses aggregating $12,414 on behalf of such directors and officer in
connection with such action.

VOTE REQUIRED

An affirmative vote by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding common
shares entitled to vote at the meeting is required for adoption of this proposal
to amend the Articles of Incorporation.

The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR this proposal.

- --------------------------------------------------

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Two shareholder proposals have been received. The corporation is advised that
the proposals will be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. The proposed
resolutions and statement made in support thereof are presented below. The names
and addresses of the shareholders submitting these proposals will be furnished
by the corporation to any person requesting such information. The board of
directors recommends that you vote AGAINST both proposals.

- --------------------------------------------------

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING (ITEM NO. 4 ON PROXY CARD)

WHEREAS:

We believe all U.S. citizens and corporate entities are being called to
sacrifice and to do their part in bringing about a more just and equitable
health care system.

During the 1980s, prescription drug prices increased at almost three times the
rate of general inflation in the United States.

The burden of these cost increases has been borne by individual consumers such
as the elderly and the underinsured in the retail market as well as increased
costs for the institutional health care facilities.

The drug companies have been criticized by citizens, organizations, and U.S.
government agencies as being unjust in the reaping of "excessive profits at the
expense of millions of U.S. citizens".

The price of drugs is consistently higher in the U.S. retail market than in
other industrialized countries.

The drug companies have argued that the higher prices in the U. S. are necessary
to recoup research and development costs. While all persons who receive these
drugs benefit from the research and development, U.S. consumers bear the burden
of these costs.

Pharmaceutical companies' recent efforts to limit overall price increases to
inflation have failed to significantly benefit retail consumers due to
discounted prices offered to volume purchasers such as HMOs and large purchasing
groups.

We believe U.S. citizens want reasonable limits on pharmaceutical prices.

RESOLVED: The shareholders request the Board to create and implement a policy of
price restraint of pharmaceutical products for both the average individual
consumer and the institutional purchasers utilizing a combination of approaches
to keep drug prices to a reasonable level.

The Board will report to shareholders on positive changes in policies and
pricing procedures for our pharmaceutical products by September, 1994.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              14

- --------------------------------------------------

PROPONENTS' STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON PHARMACEUTICAL
PRICING

In creating this policy the Board should consider a formula whereby the
individual price on each of the top five prescription drugs for the retail
market based on dollar volume in the U.S. for our company be no higher than 10%
of the average price for each of the five drugs in the top five markets of these
same drugs in the industrialized world. If the price differential is more than
10% for any one of the drugs, that a voluntary cap be immediately placed on the
price of said drug in the U.S. until the differential is within the 10%.

Drug pricing has been a controversial topic for the last few years. Now that we
are facing major reforms in our health care system in the U.S. it seems most
appropriate that all pharmaceutical companies take their share of the
responsibility in this reform effort.

- --------------------------------------------------

BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON
PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING (ITEM NO. 4 ON PROXY CARD)

Your Board of Directors opposes the shareholders' proposal and recommends that
you vote AGAINST it.

As a global health care company operating in over one hundred geographic markets
with a diverse mix of businesses, Abbott supports the goal of improving the
access of people worldwide to a high quality of health care while reducing the
rate of growth of health care costs.

Abbott has established itself as a leader in the global health care industry by
consistently introducing innovative products that improve the quality of health
care for patients, offer user efficiencies and reduce the cost of patient
therapy.

The Company has priced its products responsibly and adjusted prices in response
to changing market conditions. In 1993, the Company's net prices for its
products (including pharmaceuticals) increased .9 percent.

We do not believe that it is in the best interests of Abbott shareholders to
adopt rigid pricing structures for any specific geographic location, any
specific category of products, or any class of customer.

Pricing decisions for all products developed, manufactured and sold by Abbott
must be flexible in order to respond to market dynamics in product and
geographic market segments, and to assure the Company's continued ability to
invest in research and development across our product lines. It is from this
investment that innovation will be reaped to allow the best chance for the
United States and other countries to accomplish the difficult goals of expanding
access, increasing quality and reducing the rate of growth of health care costs.

Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

- --------------------------------------------------

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT FORMULA (ITEM NO. 5 ON PROXY CARD)

WHEREAS - the misuse of infant formula is a serious health problem. When formula
is mixed with impure water or inadequate amounts of formula are used in
preparation, infants often become sick and many die. In fact UNICEF's Director,
James Grant has estimated that over one million babies lives could be saved
annually if their mothers breastfed instead of bottlefed. Thus, it is vitally
important that infant formula companies do not engage in marketing or promotion
practices which undermine breast-feeding and promote formula instead. We are
pleased that our company has stated publicly that it endorses breast-feeding as
the superior form of infant nutrition and is committed to the principle that its
marketing practices do not discourage breast-feeding.

Hiroshi Nakajima, M. D., Ph.D., Director-General of the World Health
Organization (WHO) and James P. Grant, Executive Director of UNICEF urge that
infant formula companies, "within the context of legal instruments and
requirements within countries, comply with the principles of the International
Code (of Marketing for Breast-Milk Substitutes) in all countries to the fullest
extent possible."

Dr. Nakajima and Mr. Grant further state that "adherence to the International
Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes in its entirety in all countries is
a minimum requirement and only one of several important actions required in
order to protect healthy practices in respect of infant and young child
feeding."

However, Abbott Ross has still not ended its practice of providing free supplies
of formula to hospitals as a marketing tool to encourage that hospital to buy
Ross formula unless forbidden to do so by government regulation. This is a clear
Code violation. In addition, Abbott continues to face other complaints that it
internationally violates the Code.

Our company also faces domestic controversy re. infant formula price fixing and
paid $140 million in settlement of a court case, and faces other cases that
could be very costly.

THEREFORE be it resolved that the shareholders request the Board of Directors to
endorse and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15

implement, within any country's legal context, the International Code of
Marketing for Breast-Milk Substitutes wherever it sells infant formula.

- --------------------------------------------------

PROPONENTS' STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT FORMULA

Adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1981 to protect infant health from
inappropriate commercial pressures, the WHO/UNICEF Code is a reasonable standard
and minimum requirement for infant formula industry behavior.

Addressing the "universality of the Code," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, M.D.,
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), says there is no label
such as developed or developing when it comes to promoting breast-feeding. He
says the Code has "universal relevance."

"Breast is best" means the preferred feeding for infants in all countries. There
should be no national boundaries for the best nutrition and healthiest babies.
We want Abbott to commit to following the Code wherever it does business.

We ask you to support this resolution requesting that company policy be
consistent with internationally agreed upon health care practices and the aim of
the Code "to promote and protect breast-feeding."

- --------------------------------------------------

BOARD OF DIRECTORS STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL ON INFANT
FORMULA
(ITEM NO. 5 ON PROXY CARD)

Your Board of Directors opposes the shareholder proposal, and recommends that
you vote AGAINST the proposal.

The WHO Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes was adopted in May, 1981 by
the World Health Assembly as a "resolution and not as a regulation." Governments
are urged to give effect to the Code according to the "social and legislative
framework" of member nations. (Article 11.1) The application of the Code varies
widely from country to country. The United States government voted against the
Code in 1981.

Abbott supports the Aims and Principles of the WHO Code,

    ". . . to contribute to the provision and adequate nutrition for infants, by
    the protection and promotion of breast-feeding, and by ensuring the proper
    use of breast-milk substitutes, when these are necessary, on the basis of
    adequate information and through appropriate marketing and distribution."
    (Article 1)

In 1983, Abbott agreed to follow the WHO Code in its entirety in DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES.

A series of WHO resolutions subsequent to 1981 clarified the intent of the World
Health Assembly that free and low cost formulas for institutions (Article 6.6)
should be provided through "normal procurement channels." Abbott has instructed
its international field management to eliminate free and low cost supplies to
institutions whenever government legislation has been passed, whenever a
hospital or group of hospitals request elimination of free supplies, or whenever
common business practice in a local area follows that pattern.

We believe that the promotion of our infant formula products to hospitals is
appropriate. Hospitals are obliged to instruct mothers of newborns in proper
feeding techniques at discharge whether the infant is breastfed or bottlefed,
including a branded name when appropriate.

Furthermore, breastfeeding in the United States has been INCREASING
significantly for the past three years in all demographic groups, and hospitals
specifically.

Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.
