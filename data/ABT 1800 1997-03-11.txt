ABBOTT LABORATORIES
PROXY STATEMENT
 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
 
The accompanying proxy is solicited on behalf of the board of directors for use
at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The meeting will be held on April 25,
1997 at the corporation's headquarters, 100 Abbott Park Road, at the
intersection of Route 137 and Waukegan Road, Lake County, Illinois. This proxy
statement and the accompanying proxy card are being mailed to shareholders on or
about March 11, 1997. The corporation will bear the cost of making solicitations
from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies
may also be solicited by mail or in person by directors, officers, or employees
of the corporation and its subsidiaries. The corporation has also retained
Georgeson & Company Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated
cost of $14,000 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING SECURITIES AND RECORD DATE
 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 1997 will be
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of January 31,
1997, the corporation had 774,437,884 outstanding common shares, which are the
only outstanding voting securities.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
VOTING OF PROXIES
 
A shareholder may vote in person, by a duly executed proxy, or through an
authorized representative. The bylaws provide that a shareholder may authorize
no more than three persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Proxies
may be revoked at any time prior to the meeting. This may be done by written
notice delivered to the secretary of the corporation, or by signing and
delivering a proxy with a later date.
 
All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and
one vote per share on all other matters. Cumulative voting allows a shareholder
to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected
and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees
as the shareholder desires. Nominees who receive the greatest number of votes
will be elected.
 
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with instructions on the proxy, the
persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive
to elect the 12 nominees hereinafter named. These
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1

shares may be voted cumulatively so that one or more of the nominees may receive
fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all). Should a nominee
become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute
designated by the board of directors, or for fewer than 12 nominees if, in the
judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable.
 
Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against approval of the
ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors, the shares represented by the
proxy will be voted as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy
will be voted FOR ratification of Arthur Andersen LLP as auditors.
 
A majority of the outstanding shares, entitled to vote on a matter, represented
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for consideration of such
matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares
represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of
the shareholders with respect to that matter. Abstentions and withheld votes
have the effect of votes against a matter.
 
A proxy may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by such
proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur,
for example, when a broker or bank is not permitted to vote stock held in street
name on certain matters in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner
of the stock. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present
and, therefore, not entitled to vote on such matter, although these shares may
be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Non-voted shares
will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be
decided at the meeting.
 
It is the corporation's policy that all proxies, ballots and voting tabulations
that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not
be disclosed except: (i) where disclosure may be required by law or regulation,
(ii) where disclosure may be necessary in order for the corporation to assert or
defend claims, (iii) where a shareholder writes comments on his or her proxy
card, (iv) where a shareholder expressly requests disclosure, (v) to allow the
inspectors of election to certify the results of a vote, or (vi) in limited
circumstances, such as a contested election or proxy solicitation not approved
and recommended by the board of directors.
 
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots and voting
tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not employees of
the corporation.
 
The board of directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be
brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the
meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of
the proxy holders.
 
- --------------------------------------------------
 
INFORMATION CONCERNING SECURITY OWNERSHIP
 
On January 31, 1997, the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust, c/o Abbott
Laboratories, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064-3500, held
60,423,224 common shares (approximately 7.8 percent of the outstanding common
shares) of the corporation. These shares were held for the individual accounts
of approximately 37,342 employees and other plan participants who participate in
the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan. The Stock Retirement Trust is
administered by both a trustee and three co-trustees. The trustee of the Trust
is Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company. The co-trustees are G. P. Coughlan, T. C.
Freyman, and E. M. Walvoord, officers of the corporation. The voting power with
respect to the shares owned by the Trust is held by and shared among the
co-trustees. The co-trustees must solicit and follow voting instructions from
the participants, if the co-trustees determine that a matter to be voted on at a
shareholder meeting could materially affect the interests of participants. The
individual participants have investment power over these shares, as provided by
the terms of the Trust. The Trust Agreement is of unlimited duration. The
co-trustees are also fiduciaries for certain other employee benefit trusts
maintained by the corporation and have shared voting and/or investment power
with respect to the 209,652 common shares (approximately .03 percent of the
outstanding shares of the corporation) held by those trusts.

Jones, D. A. L. Owen, B. Powell, Jr., and A. B. Rand. This committee develops

and advises the board of directors with respect to the conduct of board
activities, including assisting the board in the evaluation of the board's own
performance. A shareholder may recommend persons as potential nominees for
director or directly nominate persons for director by complying with the
procedures on page 14.
 
The board affairs committee, whose members were W. L. Weiss, chairman, K. F.
Austen, H. L. Fuller, A. F. Jacobson, and D. A. Jones, held one meeting in 1996.

to the conduct of board activities. In cooperation with the nominations

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 
Report of the Compensation Committee
 
The compensation committee of the board of directors is composed entirely of
directors who have never been employees of the corporation. The committee is
responsible for setting and administering the policies and programs that govern
both annual compensation and stock ownership programs.
 
The foundation of the executive compensation program is based on principles
designed to align compensation with the corporation's business strategy, values
and management initiatives. The program:
 
    - Integrates compensation programs which link total shareholder return with
      both the corporation's annual and long-term strategic planning and
      measurement processes.
 
    - Supports a performance-oriented environment that rewards actual
      performance that is related to both goals and performance of the
      corporation as compared to that of industry performance levels.
 
    - Helps attract and retain key executives critical to the long-term success
      of the corporation.
 
The key components of the compensation program are base salary, annual incentive
award, and equity participation. These components are administered with the goal
of providing total compensation that is competitive in the marketplace,
recognizes meaningful differences in individual performance and offers the
opportunity to earn above average rewards when merited by individual and
corporate performance.
 
The marketplace is defined by comparing the corporation to a group of major
corporations with similar characteristics, including industry and technology
emphasis. These companies are included in the Standard and Poor's Healthcare
Composite Index. A select group of non-healthcare companies chosen for size and
performance comparability to the corporation is used as a secondary source of
comparison.
 
Using compensation survey data from the comparison groups, a target for total
compensation and each of its elements -- base, incentive, and equity-based
compensation -- is established. The intent is to deliver total compensation that
will be in the upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
the corporation's performance. To achieve this objective, a substantial portion
of executive pay is delivered through performance-related variable compensation
programs which are based upon achievement of the corporation's goals. Each year
the committee reviews the elements of executive compensation to ensure that the
total compensation program, and each of its elements, meets the overall
objectives discussed above.
 
In 1996, total compensation was paid to executives based on individual
performance and on the extent to which the business plans for their areas of
responsibility were achieved or exceeded. On balance, performance goals were
substantially met or exceeded and therefore compensation was paid accordingly.
 
Base compensation was determined by an assessment of each executive's
performance, current salary in relation to the salary range designated for the
job, experience, and potential for advancement as well as by the performance of
the corporation. While many aspects of performance can be measured in financial
terms, the committee also evaluated the success of the management team in areas
of performance that cannot be measured by traditional accounting tools,
including the development and execution of strategic plans, the development of
management and employees, and the exercise of leadership within the industry and
in the communities that Abbott serves. All of these factors were collectively
taken into account by management and the compensation committee in determining
the appropriate level of base compensation and annual increases.
 
The Abbott Management Incentive Plan is designed to reward executives when the
corporation achieves certain financial objectives and when each executive's area
of responsibility meets its predetermined goals. These goals include financial
elements such as profitability, total sales, and earnings per share and
non-financial elements such as the achievement of selected strategic goals and
the successful development of human resources. Each year, individual incentive
targets are established for incentive plan participants based on competitive
survey data from the group of companies discussed above. As noted above, targets
are set to deliver total compensation between the mid and upper range of
competitive practice as warranted by corporate performance. For 1996, 40% of the
target award was earned for achievement of the corporation's earning per share
goal. The remainder of the targeted incentive was earned based on the
committee's overall assessment of each participant's achievement of the
predetermined goals discussed above.
 
The corporation has provided forms of equity participation as a key part of its
total program for motivating and rewarding executives and managers for many
years. Grants of stock options and restricted stock
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               8

have provided an important part of the equity link to shareholders. Through
these vehicles, the corporation has encouraged its executives to obtain and hold
the corporation's stock. Targeted award ranges for stock options and restricted
stock opportunities are determined taking into account competitive practice
among the comparison companies noted above. Equity participation targets are set
based on established salary ranges and level of performance. As noted above, the
target ranges are established such that equity participation opportunities will
be in the mid-to-upper range of pay practices of peer companies when merited by
corporation and individual performance.
 
Actual individual awards are determined based on the established competitive
target range and the committee's overall assessment of individual performance.
The committee considers the amounts of options and restricted stock previously
granted and the aggregate size of current awards in deciding to award additional
options and restricted stock.
 
In 1996, the committee granted Mr. Burnham, the corporation's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, a base salary increase of 3.5% which was consistent with the
corporation's established merit increase program. As reflected in the
corporation's financial statements, Abbott's performance in 1996 included 10.0%
growth in sales and 13.7% growth in earnings per share. In light of this
performance and their overall assessment of his performance, the committee
determined to grant Mr. Burnham a bonus, stock option grant and restricted
stock.
 
It is the committee's policy to establish and maintain compensation programs for
executive officers which operate in the best interests of the corporation and
its stockholders in achieving the corporation's long-term business objectives.
To that end, the committee will continue to assess the impact of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on its executive compensation strategy and
take action to assure that appropriate levels of deductibility are maintained.

TABLE FOOTNOTES
 
(1) One-third of the shares covered by these options are exercisable after one
    year; two-thirds after two years; and all after three years. Limited stock
    appreciation rights have been granted in tandem with these options. These
    rights are only exercisable for sixty days following a change in control of
    the corporation. Upon exercise, the optionee must surrender the related
    option and will receive a payment, in cash, in an amount equal to the
    difference between the option's price and the fair market value of the
    shares subject to the option.
 
(2) The dollar amounts under these columns are the result of calculations at the
    5% and 10% rates required by the SEC and, therefore, are not intended to
    forecast possible future appreciation, if any, of the stock price.
 
(3) Amounts were determined using total shares outstanding at December 31, 1996
    of 774,449,226 and December 31, 1996 closing market price of $50.75 per
    share.

Annuity Retirement Plan
 
The corporation and certain subsidiaries maintain a defined benefit pension plan
known as the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan covering most employees
in the United States, age 21 or older. Pension benefits are generally based on
service and eligible earnings for the 60 consecutive months within the final 120
months of employment for which eligible earnings were highest. Pension benefits
are partially offset for Social Security benefits.
 
The following table shows the estimated annual benefits payable to employees
upon normal retirement. The amounts shown are computed on a straight life
annuity basis without giving effect to Social Security offsets and include
supplemental benefits under a nonqualified supplemental pension plan.

The table above covers the aggregate pension accrued under both the Annuity
Retirement Plan and the supplemental pension plan. The compensation considered
in determining the pensions payable to the named officers is the compensation
shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on
page 10 and, for D. L. Burnham and T. R. Hodgson, the restricted stock awards
vesting during the year ($262,500 and $157,500, respectively, for 1996).
Pensions accrued under the Annuity Retirement Plan are funded through the Abbott
Laboratories Annuity Retirement Trust, established on behalf of all participants
in that plan. Pensions accrued under the nonqualified supplemental pension plan
with present values exceeding $100,000 are funded through individual trusts
established on behalf of the officers who participate in that plan. During 1996,
the following amounts, less applicable tax withholdings, were deposited in such
individual trusts established on behalf of the named officers: D. L. Burnham,
$2,469,190; T. R. Hodgson, $2,813,898; P. N. Clark, $425,200; G. P. Coughlan,
$358,613; and J. G. Kringel, $860,538. As of December 31, 1996, the years of
service credited under the Plan for the named officers were as follows: D. L.
Burnham - 14; T. R. Hodgson - 24; P. N. Clark - 12; G. P. Coughlan - 6; and J.
G. Kringel - 16.

Compensation of Directors
 
Employees of the corporation are not compensated for serving on the board or on
board committees. Non-employee directors are compensated under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan in the amounts of $4,167 for each
month of service as director and $667 for each month of service as chairman of a
board committee ($1,600 for each month of service as chairman of the executive
committee).
 
Fees earned under this Plan are paid in cash to the director, paid in the form
of non-qualified stock options, or deferred (as a non-funded obligation of the
corporation or paid into a secular trust established by the director) until
payments commence (generally at age 65 or upon retirement from the board of
directors). If the fees are deferred, the director may elect to have the fees
credited to a stock equivalent account under which the fees accrue the same
return they would have earned if invested in common shares of the corporation.
Interest is accrued annually on deferred fees not credited to a stock equivalent
account.
 
If a non-employee director elects to receive any or all of his or her directors'
fees in the form of non-qualified stock options, the fees covered by that
election are converted into stock options based on an independent appraisal of
the value of the options. The options are granted on the date the corresponding
fees would otherwise be paid and at a purchase price equal to the fair market
value of the shares covered by the option on the grant date. Each such option is
fully exercisable after six months from the grant date and may be exercised
during the ten year period following its grant date.
 
Under the Plan, the corporation may grant a director who retires from the board
a retirement benefit, and such benefit will be payable to the surviving spouse
of any director who dies while serving as a director. The retirement benefit
consists of payment of an amount equal to the monthly director's fee in effect
on the date the director retires (or, for a director who dies, the fee in effect
on the date of death) for a period equal to his or her service on the board to a
maximum of 120 months. In return for the retirement benefit, the director agrees
to provide consulting services to the board.
 
Under the Abbott Laboratories 1996 Incentive Stock Program, each non-employee
director who is elected to the board of directors at the annual shareholder
meeting receives a restricted stock award with a fair market value on the date
of the award closest to, but not exceeding, twenty-two thousand dollars. In
1996, this was 537 shares. The shares are nontransferable prior to termination,
retirement from the board, death, or a change in control of the corporation. The
non-employee directors are entitled to vote the shares and receive all dividends
paid on the shares.
 
In 1996, K. F. Austen, a non-employee director, performed services for the
corporation pursuant to a consulting agreement in the areas of research and
development, new technology and immunopharmacology. The consulting agreement,
which expires on March 31, 1998, provides that the fees he earns under the
agreement may receive the same treatment as fees earned under the Abbott
Laboratories Non-Employee Directors' Fee Plan. In 1996, Dr. Austen received
$50,000 for his consulting services.
