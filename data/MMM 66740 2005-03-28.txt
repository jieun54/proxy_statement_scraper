By Order of the Board of Directors

GREGG M. LARSON
Associate General Counsel and Secretary
THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND PROXY CARD ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED ON OR ABOUT
MARCH 28, 2005.
iii




PROXY STATEMENT
The Board of Directors (the Board) of 3M Company (3M
or the Company) is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
You are receiving a proxy statement because you own shares of 3M common stock
that entitle you to vote at the meeting. By use of a proxy, you can vote
whether or not you attend the meeting. The proxy statement describes the
matters we would like you to vote on and provides information on those matters
so you can make an informed decision.
The information included in
this proxy statement relates to proposals to be voted on at the meeting (if
properly presented), voting process, compensation of directors and our most
highly paid officers, and other required information.
Purpose of the Annual Meeting
The purpose of the Annual
Meeting is to elect directors and to conduct the business described in the
Notice of Annual Meeting.
Annual Meeting Admission
Only stockholders are invited to attend the meeting. An admission ticket
or proof of ownership of 3M stock, along with personal identification, must be
presented in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. If you are a
stockholder of record, your admission ticket is on the back of this proxy
statement. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder
of record, you must bring a brokerage statement or other proof of ownership
with you to the Annual Meeting, or obtain an admission ticket in advance.
Tickets are also available on the Internet voting site  www.eproxy.com/mmm.
No
cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases, or
packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting.
Quorum
A quorum is the minimum number
of shares required to hold a meeting. Under 3Ms Bylaws, a quorum requires that
a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote at the meeting
must be represented in person or by proxy at the meeting. Both abstentions and
broker non-votes are counted as present for determining the presence of a
quorum. Broker non-votes, however, are not counted as shares present and
entitled to be voted with respect to the matter on which the broker has not
voted. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any of the matters
to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Generally, broker non-votes occur when
shares held by a broker for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a
particular proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting
instructions from the beneficial owner and (2) the broker lacks
discretionary voting power to vote such shares.
Stockholders Entitled to Vote
Each share of our common stock outstanding as of the
close of business on March 11, 2005, the record date, is entitled to one
vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought before the meeting.
As of that date, there were 772,204,170 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding.
Most 3M stockholders
hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, trustee, or other nominee rather
than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions
between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:
·       STOCKHOLDER
OF RECORD  If your shares are registered directly in your name with 3Ms
Transfer Agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of
record of those 
1 


shares and these proxy materials are being sent
directly to you by 3M. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to
grant your voting proxy directly to 3M or to vote in person at the meeting.
·       BENEFICIAL
OWNER  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, by a bank,
trustee, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares
held in street name and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by
your broker, trustee, or nominee who is considered the stockholder of record of
those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your
broker, trustee or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the
meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote
these shares in person at the meeting. Your broker, trustee, or nominee is
obligated to provide you with a voting instruction card for you to use.
·       If your shares are held in
your account in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership
Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you are considered the beneficial owner of these
shares and the trustee of the plans is the stockholder of record. Participants
in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M
Savings Plan may direct the trustee how to vote the shares allocated to their
account by following the voting instructions contained on the proxy card. Participants
in 3Ms Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan may also
direct the trustee how to vote a proportionate number of allocated shares of
common stock for which it has not received direction, and shares not allocated
to individual participant accounts by following the same voting instructions. If
you fail to direct the trustee how to vote your shares by following these
voting instructions, the trustee will vote your shares as described in the
voting instructions.
Proposals
You Are Asked to Vote On and the Boards Voting Recommendations
The
following proposals are scheduled to be voted on at the meeting. 3Ms Board
recommends that you vote your shares as indicated below.



Proposals:


The Boards
  Voting Recommendations:




 1.   The election of directors for a 3-year
  term.


FOR
  each nominee
  to the Board




 2.   The ratification of the appointment of
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as 3Ms independent registered public accounting
  firm.


FOR




 3.   Approve the adoption of the 2005 Management
  Stock Ownership Program.


FOR




 4.   Consideration of a stockholder proposal
  regarding animal testing.


AGAINST




 5.   Consideration of a stockholder proposal
  regarding 3Ms business operations in China.


AGAINST



 
Other than the proposals
described in this proxy statement, the Board is not aware of any other matters
to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy by telephone,
Internet, or by signing and returning your proxy card, any of the persons named
as proxy holders  W. James McNerney, Jr., 3Ms Chairman and CEO, Edward
A. Brennan, and Rozanne L. Ridgway ­­ will have the discretion to vote your
shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the 
2 


meeting. If
any of our nominees is unavailable as a candidate for director, the above-named
proxy holders will vote your proxy for another candidate or candidates as may
be nominated by the Board of Directors.
Required Vote
Director Nominees  The nominees for election as
directors at the Annual Meeting will be elected by a plurality of the votes
cast at the meeting. This means that the director nominee with the most votes
for a particular slot is elected for that slot. Votes withheld from one or more
director nominees will have no effect on the election of any director from whom
votes are withheld.
All other proposals require
the affirmative FOR vote of a majority of those shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. If you
are a beneficial owner and do not provide the stockholder of record with voting
instructions, your shares may constitute broker non-votes, as described in the
section above entitled Quorum.         In
tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that
constitute broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that
proposal. The stockholder proposals are presented as a request to the Board to
take action. Affirmative votes for these proposals will inform the Board about
the level of support for these proposals.
Voting Methods
If you hold shares directly as the stockholder of
record, you may vote by granting a proxy or, if you hold shares beneficially in
street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. If
you own shares beneficially as a participant in the 3M Voluntary Investment
Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M Savings Plan, you may vote by
submitting voting instructions to the trustee. In most instances, you will be
able to do this over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail. Please refer to
the summary instructions below and those included on your proxy card or, for
shares held in street name, the voting instruction card included by your broker
or nominee.
The Internet and
telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by use of
a control number and to allow you to confirm that your instructions have been
properly recorded. If you vote by telephone or on the Internet, you do not need
to return your proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting for stockholders of
record will be available 24 hours a day, and will close at 12:00 p.m.
(Central Time) on the day before the Annual Meeting. Participants in 3Ms
Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the 3M Savings
Plan may instruct the trustee how to vote their shares via the Internet, by
telephone, or by signing and returning the proxy card by 5:00 p.m.
(Central Time) on May 5, 2005.
·       VOTE
BY INTERNET  www.eproxy.com/mmm  If you have Internet access, you may
submit your proxy from any location in the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Have your proxy card and the last four digits of your Social Security Number in
hand when you access the Web site. When prompted, enter the last four digits of
your Social Security Number, your 3-digit company number and the 7-digit
number from the upper right corner of the proxy card to create an electronic
ballot.
·       VOTE
BY TELEPHONE  1-800-560-1965  If you live in the United
States, you may use any touch-tone telephone to vote your proxy toll-free 24
hours a day, 7 days a week. Have your proxy card in hand when you call. When
prompted, enter the 3-digit company number and the 7-digit number
from the upper right corner of the proxy card. Follow the recorded
instructions.
·       VOTE
BY MAIL  You may do this by signing your proxy card or, for shares held in
street name, the voting instruction card included by your broker or nominee and
mailing it. If you 
3 


provide specific voting instructions, your shares will
be voted as you instruct. If you sign, but do not provide instructions, your
shares will be voted as the Board recommends. Mark, sign, and date your proxy
card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided so that it is received
by May 9, 2005.
All shares that have been
properly voted and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Changing Your Vote
You may change your proxy
instructions at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. For shares
held directly in your name, you may accomplish this by granting a new proxy or
by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. For shares held beneficially by you,
you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker
or nominee.
Counting the Vote
In the election of directors, you may vote FOR all
of the nominees or your vote may be WITHHELD from one or more of the
nominees. For the other proposals, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.
If you ABSTAIN, it has the same effect as a vote AGAINST.  If you sign your proxy card or broker voting
instruction card with no further instructions, your shares will be voted in
accordance with the recommendations of the Board. Shares held in your account
in the 3M Voluntary Investment Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the 3M
Savings Plan will be voted by the trustee as described in Stockholders
Entitled to Vote on page 1.
Representatives of Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., 3Ms transfer agent, will tabulate the votes and act as the
inspectors of election.
Confidentiality
The Companys Board of
Directors has a policy that all stockholder proxies, ballots, and tabulations
that identify stockholders are to be maintained in confidence. No such document
will be available for examination, and the identity and vote of any stockholder
will not be disclosed, except as necessary to meet legal requirements and allow
the inspectors of election to certify the results of the stockholder vote. The
policy also provides that inspectors of election for stockholder votes must be
independent and cannot be employees of the Company. Occasionally, stockholders
provide written comments on their proxy card that may be forwarded to 3M
management.
Results of the Vote
We will announce preliminary
voting results at the meeting and publish final results in our Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2005. A news
release with voting results will be available on our Web site www.3M.com/profile/pressbox/index.jhtml.
Delivery of Proxy Materials
Securities and Exchange Commission rules now
allow us to deliver a single copy of an annual report and proxy statement to
any household at which two or more stockholders reside, if we believe the
stockholders are members of the same family. This rule benefits both you
and the Company. We believe it eliminates irritating duplicate mailings that
stockholders living at the same address receive and it reduces our printing and
mailing costs. This rule applies to any annual reports, proxy statements,
proxy statements combined with a prospectus, or information statements. Each
stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting
instruction card.
Your household may have received a single set of proxy
materials this year. If you prefer to receive your own copy now or in future
years, please request a duplicate set by contacting our 
4 


transfer agent, Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952 (U.S.), 651-450-4064
(outside the U.S.), www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices, or in writing
to 161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075.
If a broker or other nominee
holds your shares, you may continue to receive some duplicate mailings. Certain
brokers will eliminate duplicate account mailings by allowing stockholders to
consent to such elimination, or through implied consent if a stockholder does
not request continuation of duplicate mailings. Since not all brokers and
nominees may offer stockholders the opportunity this year to eliminate
duplicate mailings, you may need to contact your broker or nominee directly to
discontinue duplicate mailings to your household.
List of Stockholders
The names of stockholders of
record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual
Meeting and for ten days prior to the meeting for any purpose germane to the
meeting, between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. (Central Time),
at our principal executive offices at 3M Center, St. Paul, Minnesota, by
contacting the Secretary of the Company.
Electronic
Delivery of Proxy Materials and Annual Report
We are able to distribute the
Annual Report and proxy statement to 3M stockholders in a fast and efficient
manner via the Internet. This reduces the amount of paper delivered to a
stockholders address and eliminates the cost of sending these documents by
mail. Stockholders may elect to view all future annual reports and proxy
statements on the Internet instead of receiving them by mail. If you choose to
view these materials online, you will continue to receive a proxy card in the
mail. You may make this election when voting your proxy this year: simply
follow the instructions to vote via the Internet or go directly to www.econsent.com/mmm
to register your consent. Have your account number (found above your name and
address on your dividend check stub) and your Social Security Number (if you
have one) available. Your election to view proxy materials online continues
until you revoke it. Future proxy cards will contain the Internet Web site
address and instructions to view the materials. You will continue to have the
option to vote your shares by telephone, mail, or via the Internet.
Cost of Proxy Solicitation
3M will pay for the cost of
preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy
materials. You will need to obtain your own Internet access if you choose to
access the proxy materials and/or vote over the Internet. In addition to
mailing these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made
in person, by telephone, or electronic communication by our directors,
officers, and employees, who do not receive any additional compensation for
these solicitation activities. We have hired Georgeson Shareholder
Communications, Inc. to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials
and the solicitation of votes. We will pay Georgeson Shareholder Communications, Inc.,
a fee of $20,000 plus expenses for these services. We will also reimburse
brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation
materials to beneficial owners of stock.
Transfer Agent
Our Transfer Agent is Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. All
communications concerning stockholders of record accounts, including address
changes, name changes, common stock transfer requirements, and similar issues
can be handled by contacting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. at 1-800-401-1952
(U.S.), 651-450-4064 (outside the U.S.), www.wellsfargo.com/shareownerservices,
or in writing, 161 North Concord Exchange, South St. Paul, MN 55075.

GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted
Corporate Governance Guidelines that, along with the charters of the Board
committees, provide the framework for the governance of the Company. The Boards
Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing
the Guidelines at least annually, and recommending any proposed changes to the
Board for approval. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our
Web site at www.3M.com, under Investor Relations  Corporate Governance.
The Guidelines and charters of the Board committees are also attached to this
proxy statement as Appendices A-E.
Executive Sessions
Independent
directors regularly meet in executive sessions without the Chairman/CEO
or other members of management present to review the criteria upon which the
performance of the Chairman and CEO is based, the performance of the Chairman
and CEO against that criteria, to ratify the compensation of the Chairman and
CEO as approved by the Compensation Committee and to discuss any other relevant
matters.
Presiding Director
The chairs of the Audit,
Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues Committees of the
Board may chair executive sessions of the independent directors at which the
principal items to be considered are within the scope of the committee chairs
authority. The Board believes that this practice ensures leadership at all
executive sessions of the independent directors.
Communication with Directors
The Board of Directors has
adopted the following process for stockholders to send communications to
members of the Board. Stockholders may communicate with the chairs of the Audit, Compensation,
Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues Committees of the Board, or
with any of our other independent directors, by sending a letter to the
following address: 3M Company, c/o Corporate Secretary, 3M Center, Building
0220-13-W-39, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.
Director Independence
The Board believes in having a substantial majority of
independent directors on the 3M Board. A director is independent if the Board
affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with 3M
(including its consolidated subsidiaries) directly or as a partner, shareholder
or officer of an organization that has a relationship with 3M. The Board has
established the following guidelines to assist it in determining director
independence that conform to, or are more exacting than the independence requirements
in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards (NYSE Rules). In addition to
applying these guidelines, the Board will consider all relevant facts and
circumstances in making an independence determination not only from the
standpoint of the director, but also from that of persons or organizations with
which the director has an affiliation.
6 


1.               In
no event will a director be considered independent if:
a.                Employment Relationship  A director is,
or has been within the last three years, an employee of 3M, or whose immediate
family member(1), is or has been within the last three years, an
executive officer of 3M;
b.               Payments >$100,000  A director who
received, or whose immediate family member received, more than $100,000 per
year in direct compensation from 3M (other than director fees) within the last
three years;
c.                Auditor Relationships. (i) A
director, or whose immediate family member, is a current partner of 3Ms
internal or external auditor; (ii) a director is a current employee of
such a firm; (iii) a director has an immediate family member who is a
current employee of such a firm and who participates in the firms audit,
assurance or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (iv) a
director, or whose immediate family member, was within the last three years
(but is no longer) a partner or employee of such a firm who personally worked
on 3Ms audit within that time;
d.               Compensation Committee Interlock  A 3M
executive officer is on the compensation committee of the board of directors of
a company which employs the 3M director or an immediate family member as an
executive officer;
e.                Commercial Relationships  A director is a
current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer,
of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, 3M for
property or services in an amount which, in of the last three years, exceeds
the greater of $1 million, or two percent of the directors companys
consolidated gross revenues.
2.               Audit
Committee members may not accept any consulting, advisory, or other
compensatory fee from 3M, other than directors fees.
3.               The
following commercial relationships will not be considered to be material
relationships that would impair a directors independence:
a.                If
a 3M director is an executive officer or employee, or if an immediate family
member is an executive officer, of another company that does business with 3M
and the sales by that company to 3M or purchases by that company from 3M, in
any single year within the last three years, are less than or equal to one
percent of the annual consolidated gross revenues of that company; or
b.               If
a 3M director is an executive officer or employee, or if an immediate family
member is an executive officer, of another company which is indebted to 3M, or
to which 3M is indebted, and the total amount of either companys indebtedness
to the other, in any single year within the last three years, is less than or
equal to one percent of the other companys total consolidated assets.
4.               Charitable
relationships will not be considered to be material relationships that would
impair a directors independence if a 3M director or immediate family member
serves as an officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization, and 3Ms
discretionary charitable contributions to the organization are less than or
equal to one percent of that organizations consolidated annual gross revenues.




(1)  New York Stock Exchange Rule
303A(2)(b) defines "immediate family" to include a person's spouse,
parents, children, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and
daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and
anyone (other than employees) who share such person's home.

5.    The Board
will annually make and publicly disclose its independence determination for
each director. The Board may determine that a director who has a relationship
that exceeds the limits described in paragraphs 3 (provided that such a
relationship would not constitute a bar to independence under the NYSE Rules)
or 4 is nonetheless independent. The Company will explain in the next proxy
statement the basis for any Board determination that a relationship is
immaterial despite the fact that it does not meet the categorical independence
guidelines. For example, if a director is the CEO of a company that purchases
products and services from 3M that are more than one percent of that companys
annual revenues, the independent directors could determine, after considering
all of the relevant circumstances, that such a relationship was immaterial, and
that the director would be considered independent under the NYSE Rules.
6.               The Company will
not make any personal loans or extensions of credit to directors. All directors
are required to deal at arms length with 3M and its subsidiaries and to
disclose circumstances material to the director that might be perceived as a
conflict of interest.
The Board of Directors has
determined that the following directors are independent under these
guidelines:  Linda G. Alvarado, Edward A.
Brennan, Vance D. Coffman, Michael L. Eskew, Edward M. Liddy, Robert S.
Morrison, Aulana L. Peters, Rozanne L. Ridgway, Kevin W. Sharer, and Louis W.
Sullivan. The Board has also determined that no members of the Audit Committee
received any compensation from the Company other than directors fees.
3M Business Conduct Policies
More than a century of operating with honesty and
integrity has earned 3M trust from our customers, credibility with our
communities, and dedication from our employees. All of our employees, including
our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting
Officer, are required to abide by 3Ms business conduct policies to ensure that
our business is conducted in a consistently legal and ethical manner. These
policies form the foundation of a comprehensive process that includes
compliance with corporate policies and procedures and a companywide focus on
uncompromising honesty and integrity in every aspect of our operations. Our
business conduct policies cover many topics, including antitrust and
competition law, conflicts of interest, financial reporting, protection of
confidential information, and compliance with all laws and regulations
applicable to the conduct of our business.
Employees are required to report any conduct that they
believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the business
conduct policies. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures to receive,
retain, and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls, or auditing matters, and to allow for the confidential and anonymous
submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters.
The Board of Directors adopted a Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics for directors of the Company. This Code incorporates
long-standing principles of conduct the Company and the Board follow to ensure
the Companys business and the activities of the Board are conducted with
integrity, adherence to the highest ethical standards, and in compliance with
the law.
The Companys Business Conduct
Policies for employees and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for
Directors are available on our web site at www.3M.com under Investor
Relations  Corporate Governance.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee
assists the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Companys financial
statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the
qualifications, independence, and performance of the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm (the Independent Accounting Firm), and the
performance of the Companys internal auditing department. In addition, the
Committee:
·       Reviews
the annual audited and quarterly consolidated financial statements;
·       Reviews
the Companys financial reporting process and disclosure and internal controls
and procedures, including major issues regarding accounting principles and
financial statement presentation, and critical accounting policies to be used
in the consolidated financial statements;
·       Reviews
and discusses with management and the Independent Accounting Firm the Companys
internal controls report and the Independent Accounting Firms attestation of
the report;
·       By
delegation to the Chair, reviews earnings press releases prior to issuance;

The Board of Directors has
determined that all of the Audit Committee members are independent, financially
literate, and have accounting or related financial management expertise
under the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Board has also
determined that all of the Audit Committee members  Edward M. Liddy (chair),
Linda G. Alvarado, Vance D. Coffman, Michael L. Eskew, and Aulana L. Peters 
are audit committee financial experts as that term is defined by applicable
SEC regulations. In addition, the Board has determined that service on more
than three other audit committees by Aulana L. Peters does not impair her
ability to serve effectively on the Companys Audit Committee because Ms. Peters
is retired and has the time to devote to her responsibilities and has
considerable expertise in audit committee matters. The charter of the Audit
Committee is available at www.3M.com under Investor Relations 
Corporate Governance  Committee Composition and attached as Appendix B to this

Companys proxy statement. In addition, the Committee:

subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Board, employment

awards and the size of their awards under such programs.

New York Stock Exchange listing standards. The Board has also determined that
each Compensation Committee member qualifies as a Non-Employee Director under
Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an Outside
Director under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The

NOMINATION PROCESS
Role of
the Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance
Committee (Committee) identifies individuals that the Committee believes are
qualified to become Board members in accordance with the Board Membership
Criteria set forth below, and recommends selected individuals to the Board for
nomination to stand for election at the next meeting of stockholders of the
Company in which directors will be elected. In the event there is a vacancy on
the Board between meetings of stockholders, the Committee identifies
individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members
in accordance with the Board Membership Criteria set forth below, and
recommends one or more of such individuals for appointment to the Board.
Nominees
Proposed by Stockholders for Consideration by the Committee
The Committee has a
policy to consider properly submitted stockholder nominees for candidates for
membership on the Board of Directors. Stockholders proposing individuals for
consideration by the Committee must include at least the following information
about the proposed nominee:  the proposed
nominees name, age, business or residence address, principal occupation or
employment, and whether such person has given written consent to being named in
the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. Stockholders
should send the required information about the nominee to:
Corporate Secretary
3M Company
3M Center
Building 0220-13-W-39
St. Paul, MN 55144-1000.
In order for an individual
proposed by a stockholder to be considered by the Committee for recommendation
as a Board nominee, the Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal no later
than 5 p.m. Central Time on November 28, 2005. Such proposals must be
sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the
stockholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Company). The
Corporate Secretary will send properly submitted stockholder proposed nominations
to the Committee Chair for consideration at a future Committee meeting.
Individuals proposed by stockholders in accordance with these procedures will
receive the same consideration that individuals identified to the Committee
through other means receive.
Stockholder Nominations
In addition, 3Ms Bylaws
permit stockholders to nominate directors at an annual meeting of stockholders
or at a special meeting at which directors are to be elected in accordance with
the notice of meeting. Stockholders intending to nominate a person for election
as a director must comply with the requirements set forth in the Companys
Bylaws. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that the Corporate Secretary
receive written notice from the record stockholder no earlier than January 9,
2006 and no later than February 8, 2006. The notice must contain the
information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request
to the Corporate Secretary. Nominations received after February 8, 2006,
will not be acted upon at the Annual Meeting.
Director Qualifications
The Committee
periodically reviews with the Board the requisite skills and characteristics of
its members. 3Ms Corporate Governance Guidelines contain Board Membership
Criteria that apply to nominees for a position on 3Ms Board. The Committee
periodically reviews with the Board the 
12 


appropriate
skills and characteristics required of Board members given the current Board
composition. It is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a
high performance organization creating competitive advantage for the Company.
To perform as such, the Board will be comprised of individuals who have
distinguished records of leadership and success in their arena of activity and
who will make substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively
represent the interests of all stockholders. The Committees and the Boards
assessment of Board candidates includes, but is not limited to, consideration
of:
(i)               Roles and
contributions valuable to the business community;
(ii)            Personal qualities of
leadership, character, judgment, and whether the candidate possesses and
maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community at
large of integrity, trust, respect, competence, and adherence to the highest
ethical standards;
(iii)         Relevant knowledge and
diversity of background and experience in such things as business,
manufacturing, technology, finance and accounting, marketing, international
business, government, and the like; or
(iv)         Whether the candidate is
free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation, and
attendance at all meetings.
In addition to these minimum
requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the nominees skills are
complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards needs for
particular expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing, technology,
financial, marketing, international, governmental, or other areas of expertise,
and assess the nominees impact on Board dynamics and effectiveness.
Identification,
Evaluation, and Selection of Nominees
The Committee periodically reviews the appropriate
size and composition of the Board and anticipates future vacancies and needs of
the Board. In the event the Committee recommends an increase in the size of the
Board or a vacancy occurs, the Committee considers qualified nominees from
several sources, including current Board members and nominees recommended by
stockholders and other persons.
The Committee may from time to time retain a director
search firm to help the Committee identify qualified director nominees for
consideration by the Committee.
The Committee evaluates
qualified director nominees at regular or special Committee meetings against
the current Board Membership Criteria described above and reviews qualified
director nominees with the Board. The Committee and the Chairman of the Board
interview candidates that meet the Board Membership Criteria and the Committee
selects nominees that best suit the Boards current needs and recommends one or
more of such individuals for election to the Board.

Nonemployee directors received $95,000 of the total
annual retainer of $150,000 in common stock of the Company pursuant to the
terms of the Companys 1992 Directors Stock Ownership Program. Nonemployee
directors may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of the foregoing
retainers payable in cash through a deferred cash or common stock equivalents
account, and retainers payable in stock through a deferred common stock
equivalents account. The nonemployee directors also may elect to receive common
stock of the Company at current fair market value, in lieu of cash retainer.
Information regarding accumulated deferred stock is set forth in the section
entitled Common Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers.  Currently, 91 percent of director
compensation is paid in 3M stock.
Stock Ownership Guidelines  The Board also approved
stock ownership guidelines that provide that each director should attain over
her or his three-year term an investment position in 3Ms stock (including
deferred stock) equal to two times the annual retainer. All directors currently
meet these stock ownership guidelines.
Matching Gift Program  The
nonemployee directors are eligible to participate in the matching gift program
on the same terms as 3M employees. Under this program, the 3M Foundation will
match up to a total of $5,000 a year in contributions by the director to
eligible institutions of higher education or public broadcasting organizations.
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE AT ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
The Company has a long-standing policy that directors
are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders unless extenuating
circumstances prevent them from attending. All directors attended last years
Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

PROPOSAL
NO. 2
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm
to audit the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31,
2005. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection.
During 2004, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as the
Companys independent registered public accounting firm and also provided
certain tax and other audit-related services. For a description of those
services and the fees paid, see section entitled Fees of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm.
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to
respond to questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the
ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Companys
independent registered public accounting firm. Proxies solicited by the Board
of Directors will be voted FOR ratification unless a contrary vote is
specified.
PROPOSAL NO. 3
APPROVE THE ADOPTION OF
THE
2005 MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM
On February 14, 2005, the
Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors adopted the 2005
Management Stock Ownership Program (the 2005 Program), subject to stockholder
approval. The 2005 Program is intended to be a successor to the Companys 2002
Management Stock Ownership Program, which will expire immediately prior to the
2005 Annual Meeting. With minor exceptions, the 2005 Program is similar to
previous management stock plans approved by the Companys stockholders.
Vote Required
Approval of the adoption of
the 2005 Program requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual
Meeting.
Summary of the 2005 Program
The following is only a
summary of the 2005 Program and is subject, in all respects, to the full text
of the 2005 Program, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as
Appendix F.
1. What
is the Purpose of the 2005 Program?
The purpose of this 2005
Program is to help the Company attract and retain outstanding employees, and to
promote the growth and success of the Companys business by aligning the
financial interests of these employees with the other stockholders of the
Company. It has been the policy of the Company to encourage employee
participation as stockholders and the Company believes that employee stock
ownership has been an important factor contributing to the Companys growth and
progress.
18 


2. Who is
Eligible to Participate in the 2005 Program?
Participation in the 2005
Program is limited to employees of the Company and those of its subsidiaries
and affiliates designated by the Board of Directors. Eligibility criteria, the
number of Participants, and the size of all awards to individual employees will
be determined by the Compensation Committee (or by the officers of the Company
to whom it delegates such authority). It is anticipated that approximately
12,000 employees will participate, including all of the Named Executive
Officers referenced in the Summary Compensation Table (with the exception of Dr. Reich,
who has retired). No individual employee may be granted Awards under the 2005
Program with respect to more than 3,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock.
3. How
Many Shares Are Available for Awards?
The number of shares of the
Companys common stock that may be issued or delivered as a result of stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other stock awards granted
during the term of the 2005 Program, or made subject to stock appreciation
rights granted during the term of the 2005 Program, will not exceed 36,750,000.
Any shares issued or delivered as a result of awards granted during the term of
the 2005 Program other than stock options or stock appreciation rights settled
exclusively in common stock will be counted against the 36,750,000 share limit
as 2.45 shares for every one share issued in connection with such award or by
which the award is valued by reference. The necessary shares will be made
available at the discretion of the Board of Directors from authorized but
unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company under
corporate repurchase programs.
4. Who Administers the 2005 Program?
The Compensation Committee will administer the 2005
Program. The Committee has full power and authority to select the Participants,
interpret the Program, continue, accelerate, or suspend the exercisability or
vesting of an Award, and adopt such rules and procedures for operating the
Program as it may deem necessary or appropriate. Its power and authority shall
include, but not be limited to, making any amendments to or modifications of
the 2005 Program which may be required or necessary to make such Program comply
with the provisions of any laws or regulations of any country or unit thereof
in which the Company operates.
The Company has retained
E*TRADE Business Solutions Group, Inc. to perform day-to-day
administrative services with respect to the 2005 Program.
5. What
Types of Awards May Be Granted Under the 2005 Program?
(a)            Incentive
Stock Options  Incentive stock options are options to purchase
shares of the Companys common stock that qualify for favorable income tax
treatment under U.S. income tax laws. Each incentive stock option granted under
the 2005 Program will have a purchase price equal to 100 percent of the fair
market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted. Each
incentive stock option granted under the 2005 Program will have a term of 10
years, and will become exercisable at the time or times established by the
Compensation Committee.
(b)           Nonqualified
Stock Options  Nonqualified stock options are options to purchase
shares of the Companys common stock that do not qualify for favorable tax treatment
under U.S. income tax laws. Each nonqualified stock option granted under the
2005 Program will have a purchase price equal to no less than 100 percent of
the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is
granted. Nonqualified stock options granted under the 2005 Program will become
exercisable and will expire at such time or times as shall be established by
the Compensation Committee. However, no nonqualified stock option will expire
later than 10 years after the grant date (except that the Committee may extend
the exercise period for nonqualified stock options 
19 


granted to Participants in any
country or countries for an additional period of up to one year if and to the
extent necessary to prevent adverse tax consequences to such Participants under
the laws of such country).
(c)            Progressive
Stock Options  Progressive stock options are additional
nonqualified stock options that the Compensation Committee may grant to certain
Participants who exercise other 3M nonqualified stock options granted under the
2002 Management Stock Ownership Program or its predecessors, and who make
payment of all or part of the purchase price and withholding taxes, if any, in
shares of the Companys common stock. The number of shares subject to each progressive
stock option would be equal to the number of shares of common stock utilized by
the Participant to effect payment of the purchase price and withholding taxes,
if any, for such other nonqualified stock option. Each progressive stock option
granted under the 2005 Program will have a purchase price equal to 100 percent
of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise of
the other nonqualified stock option, which will be the grant date of such
progressive stock option. Each progressive stock option granted under the 2005
Program will become exercisable six months after the grant date, and will
expire at the same time the other nonqualified stock option exercised by the
Participant would have expired. Progressive stock options will not be granted
with respect to the exercise of nonqualified stock options granted under the
2005 Program.
(d)           Stock
Appreciation Rights  A stock appreciation right means the right of
a Participant to receive a payment in cash or shares of the Companys common
stock based on the increase in value of shares of the Companys common stock
between the date the right is granted and the date it is exercised by the
Participant. A stock appreciation right will be exercisable during the period
determined by the Compensation Committee, but in no event will this period be
longer than 10 years from the date of grant. Each stock appreciation right will
become exercisable at the time or times determined by the Compensation
Committee. A Participant will not be required to make any payment in order to
exercise a stock appreciation right, except for any applicable withholding
taxes.
(e)            Restricted
Stock  Restricted stock is actual shares of the Companys common
stock granted to a Participant subject to certain conditions established by the
Compensation Committee. Until these conditions are satisfied by the Participant
or waived by the Committee, (1) the Participant may not transfer or
dispose of the restricted stock, (2) the shares are held in custody by the
Company for the Participants account, (3) the participant has the rights
and privileges of a stockholder, including the right to vote the shares, and (4) dividends
on the shares may either be paid to the Participant or withheld and credited to
the Participants account (with interest), as determined by the Compensation
Committee. One of these conditions will be a requirement that the Participant
remain employed by the Company until the restricted stock becomes vested. If
the Participants employment with the Company ends before the restricted stock
has vested (or before any of the other conditions have been satisfied), the
shares are forfeited. Once the conditions have been satisfied or waived and the
restricted stock has vested, the Participant will become entitled to receive
the shares of common stock free from any restrictions on transfer or sale.
(f)                Restricted Stock Units  Restricted stock units are units
granted to a Participant having a value equal to a share of the Companys
common stock, and subject to certain conditions established by the Compensation
Committee. Unlike restricted stock, no actual shares of the Companys common
stock are created or set aside for a Participant upon the grant of restricted
stock units and the Participant generally does not have the rights and
privileges of a stockholder. However, dividend equivalents on the restricted
stock units may either be paid to the Participant or withheld and reinvested in
additional restricted stock units, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
One of the conditions applicable to each restricted stock unit will be a
requirement that the Participant remain employed by the Company until the
restricted stock unit becomes 
20 


vested. If the Participants
employment with the Company ends before the restricted stock unit has vested
(or before any of the other conditions have been satisfied), the units are
forfeited. Once the conditions have been satisfied or waived and the restricted
stock units have vested, the Participant will be entitled to receive shares of
the Companys common stock having a value equal to the value of the restricted
stock units and free from any restrictions on their transfer or sale.
(g)           Other Stock Awards  The 2005 Program authorizes the
Compensation Committee to make additional awards of the Companys common stock
besides those described above, subject to such terms and conditions as it may
determine in its sole discretion.
6. How Do
Participants Make Payment for Awards?
Payment of the purchase price
for shares of the Companys common stock subject to an option granted under the
2005 Program may be made in the form of cash or shares of the Companys common
stock. If payment is made in shares of common stock, such shares will be valued
at 100 percent of their fair market value on the day the Participant exercised
his or her option or, as regards a withholding tax, such other date when the
tax withholding obligation becomes due. A Participant making payment in shares
of the Companys common stock need not actually surrender such shares, but may
instead receive the net number of shares receivable upon the exercise of an
option after paying the purchase price and any applicable withholding taxes by
giving satisfactory evidence of ownership.
7. Are
There Any Restrictions on Transferring Awards?
With a limited exception described below, the 2005
Program prohibits the transfer, assignment or pledge of any award granted under
the Program. However, in the event of the death of a Participant who holds
unexercised options or stock appreciation rights, the 2005 Program permits such
options or rights to be exercised within two years following the date of death
(but not beyond the original expiration date) by the Participants estate or by
a person who acquired the right to exercise such options or rights by reason of
the death of the Participant.
The 2005 Program authorizes
the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, to permit certain
Participants to transfer ownership of all or any portion of the nonqualified
stock options granted to them under the 2005 Program to their immediate family
members, a trust for the exclusive benefit of such immediate family members, or
a partnership in which immediate family members are the only partners. Individuals
who elect to transfer ownership of such nonqualified stock options may not
receive any consideration for making such transfer, and they remain responsible
for the payment of all withholding taxes due upon exercise of the transferred
options. Following transfer, any such options remain subject to the same terms
and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer.
8. Under
What Circumstances Are Awards Terminated?
(a)            Stock
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights  All stock options and stock
appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Program terminate 90 days after the
termination of a Participants employment with the Company for any reason other
than retirement, death, disability or a disqualifying termination. All stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Program terminate
immediately upon the disqualifying termination of a Participants employment
with the Company. If a Participant dies before exercising all of his or her
stock options and stock appreciation rights, the remaining options and rights
may be exercised within the two years following the date of death (but not
beyond the original expiration date) by the Participants estate or by a person
who acquired the right to exercise such options and rights by reason of the
death of the Participant.
21 


(b)           Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units  Unless the Compensation Committee
in its discretion waives all conditions for the vesting of a Participants
restricted stock or restricted stock units, all shares of restricted stock and
all restricted stock units granted to a Participant under the 2005 Program that
have not already vested shall be forfeited upon the termination of such
Participants employment with the Company. However, all conditions for the
vesting of a Participants restricted stock or restricted stock units
automatically lapse upon the death of such Participant, and a certificate for
such shares shall be delivered to the Participants estate, representative or
beneficiary.
(c)            Exceptions  Notwithstanding the previous rules, if a
Participants employment with the Company is terminated before he or she has
fully exercised a stock option or stock appreciation right under circumstances
which the Compensation Committee believes to warrant special consideration, the
Committee may permit such Participant to exercise the option or right
(including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of
termination) within two years following his or her termination of employment
(but not beyond the expiration date of such option or right).
9. What
are the Tax Consequences of the Awards?
The following
discussion is intended to provide only a general outline of the federal income
tax consequences of participation in the 2005 Program and the receipt of awards
thereunder by Participants subject to U.S. taxes. It does not address any other
taxes imposed by the United States or any state or political subdivision
thereof, or the tax consequences applicable to Participants who are not subject
to U.S. taxes.
(a)            Incentive
Stock Options  Although the Compensation Committee does not intend
to use such authority at the present time, the 2005 Program does authorize the
granting of incentive stock options (ISO) that meet the requirements of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. A Participant who exercises
an ISO does not recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise, and the
Company is not entitled to a tax deduction. Upon the sale of shares obtained by
exercising an ISO after the shares have been held more than one year, the
excess of the sale price over the purchase price is taxed as long-term capital
gain. If the shares are sold within one year of the date of exercise, the
excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise (or sale
proceeds if less) over the purchase price is taxed as ordinary income, and the
Company gets a tax deduction for this amount. The remaining gain, if any, is
taxed as short-term capital gain. Unless the shares obtained by exercising an
ISO are sold within the same calendar year as they are purchased, the exercise
of such option will increase the participants income for purposes of the
alternative minimum tax. The amount of income will equal the amount by which
the fair market value of the shares purchased as of the date of exercise
exceeds the purchase price paid for such shares. If a Participant is required
to pay alternative minimum tax as a result of exercising an ISO, the amount
paid can be carried over and credited against the Participants regular income
tax liability in subsequent years.
(b)           Nonqualified
Stock Options  A Participant who exercises a nonqualified stock
option recognizes taxable ordinary income in the year the option is exercised
in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares
purchased on the exercise date over the purchase price. The Company is entitled
to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the
participant. The excess of the proceeds from any subsequent sale of the shares
purchased over the fair market value on the date of exercise is taxed as
long-term capital gain if the shares are held more than one year and as
short-term capital gain if held one year or less.
(c)            Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units  A Participant
normally will not recognize taxable income and the Company will not be entitled
to a deduction upon the grant of shares of restricted stock or restricted stock
units. When the shares or units vest, the Participant will recognize 
22 


taxable ordinary income
in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares at that time less the
amount, if any, paid for the shares, and the Company will be entitled at that
time to a deduction in the same amount. However, a Participant may elect to
recognize taxable ordinary income in the year the shares of restricted stock or
restricted stock units are granted in an amount equal to the excess of their
fair market value at the grant date, determined without regard to the
restrictions, over the amount, if any, paid for the shares. In that event, the
Company will be entitled to a deduction in such year in the same amount, and
any gain or loss realized by the Participant upon the subsequent disposition of
the shares will be taxed as short- or long-term capital gain but will not
result in any further deduction for the Company.
10. What
Happens if There is a Change in Control?
(a)            The 2005 Program
provides for the acceleration of vesting and other rights in and to awards
under the 2005 Program in the event of a change in control. The 2005 Program
defines a change in control to have occurred in either of the following
events:
i.                   when any
individual or entity shall have accumulated or own beneficially 20 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the Companys then outstanding securities
in any capacity other than as a trustee or fiduciary of an employee benefit
plan of the Company, unless a majority of the Continuing Directors (as defined
in Article Thirteenth of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation)
determine in their sole discretion that a change in control has not occurred;
or
ii.                when the
Continuing Directors shall fail to constitute a majority of the Companys Board
of Directors.
(b)           In the case of stock
options and stock appreciation rights, a change in control shall result in the
options and rights becoming immediately exercisable in full and remaining so
for at least a minimum period of six months following the change in control,
but in no event beyond the original expiration dates.
(c)            In the case of
restricted stock, restricted stock units or other awards, a change in control
shall result in the immediate vesting of all shares of restricted stock and all
restricted stock units and any conditions originally established by the
Compensation Committee with respect to other awards lapsing and becoming void,
and stock certificates for the number of shares represented by such awards
under the 2005 Program shall be immediately deliverable to the Participants.
11. How
Long Will the 2005 Program Remain in Effect, and May it be Changed?
The 2005 Program will become effective
on the date it is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders and expires on
the third anniversary of the effective date (unless it is terminated before
then). The Board of Directors may at any time terminate or amend the 2005
Program, except that no amendment may be made without the prior approval of 3M
stockholders that would either (1) authorize the issuance or delivery of
(or the granting of stock appreciation rights with respect to) more than
36,750,000 shares of the Companys common stock, or (2) permit the
granting of awards with purchase prices lower than those described in Q&A 5
above. No amendment or termination of the 2005 Program will adversely affect
awards previously granted.

PROPOSAL NO. 4
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL
3M has received a stockholder proposal from Patience
Pierce, Dorothy Goldberg, David Goldberg, Patricia Berman, and Marlis Shaffer
(the Proponents). The Proponents have requested the Company to include the
following proposal and supporting statement in its proxy statement for the Annual
Meeting of Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on at the Annual Meeting
only if properly presented by the Proponent or the Proponents qualified
representative.
Proponents Proposal:
This Proposal is submitted by a collective of
concerned shareholders.1
WHEREAS, statistics
published by research oversight bodies in North America and Europe document
that the vast majority of painful and distressing animal experiments are
conducted to satisfy outdated, government-mandated testing requirements2  and that such
testing is on the rise;3  and



1                      The
proponents of this Resolution are Patience Pierce, Dorothy Goldberg, David
Goldberg, Patricia Berman, and Marlis Shaffer.

WHEREAS, nearly 60% of animals used in regulatory
testing suffer pain ranging from moderate to severe, all the way to pain near,
at, or above the pain tolerance threshold,4 generally without any pain relief; and
WHEREAS, non-animal test methods are generally less
expensive,5 more rapid, and always more humane, than
animal-based tests; and
WHEREAS, unlike animal tests, non-animal methods have
been scientifically validated and/or accepted as total replacements for the
following five toxicity endpoints: skin corrosion (irreversible tissue damage),
skin irritation (milder and reversible damage), skin absorption (the rate of
chemical penetration), phototoxicity (an inflammatory reaction caused by the
interaction of a chemical with sunlight), and pyrogencity (a fever-like
reaction that can occur when certain intravenous drugs interact with the immune
system);
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the shareholders
request that the Board:
1.               Commit specifically
to using only non-animal methods for assessing skin corrosion, irritation,
absorption, phototoxicity and pyrogenicity.
2.               Confirm that it is
in the Companys best interest to commit to replacing animal-based tests with
non-animal methods.
3.               Petition the
relevant regulatory agencies requiring safety testing for the Companys
products to accept as total replacements for animal-based methods, those
approved non-animal methods described above, along with any others currently
used and accepted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) and other developed countries.
Supporting Statement:
This Resolution is designed to harmonize the interests of sound science with
the elimination of animal-based test methods where non-animal methodologies
exist. It seeks to encourage the relevant regulatory agencies to join their
peers in accepting validated in vitro and
other non-animal test methods. It will not compromise consumer safety or
violate applicable statutes and regulations.
Further, this Resolution commits the Company to end
animal testing for five specific endpoints in favor of valid non-animal
methods. These include the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test, human
skin equivalent tests for corrosivity, and a human blood-based test for
pyrogenicity, all of which have been successfully validated through the
European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods.6  Several
non-animal methods have also been adopted as Test Guidelines by the OECD7 (an alliance of 30
member countries including the US, EU, Japan, Canada and Australia). Regulatory
agencies in OECD member countries are not at liberty to reject data from
non-animal tests for skin corrosion, skin absorption and phototoxicity where
such data have been generated in accordance with an OECD Test Guideline.
We urge shareholders to support this Resolution.

Boards
Statement Opposing the Proposal
3M is supportive of the principle of protecting the
comfort and welfare of animals that underlies the proposal, but must oppose the
proposal for two reasons. First, 3M is already doing what it can to minimize
the use of animal testing, and second, existing technology and regulatory
requirements do not permit 3M to use the proposed non-animal alternatives for
all of its products.
3M is obligated to ensure that its products are
effective and safe. At present, this requires the judicious use of laboratory
animals in research and development of some products. 3M looks forward to the
day when science has developed to the point where the use of animals no longer
is required to establish the efficacy and safety of its products. Until then,
3M is committed to the use of alternatives to animals when feasible and
subscribes to the recognized principles of replacement, reduction and
refinement.*  When animal studies are
deemed necessary, animals are treated humanely, ethically, and in accord with
accepted veterinary practices to promote their comfort and well-being; their
use is scientifically justified; and their care and treatment are carefully
scrutinized by an effective institutional animal care and use review process.
Facilities in which animals are used must meet or exceed all applicable
standards and regulations governing animal care and use.
3M uses state-of-the-art technologies to minimize its
reliance on animal testing and to reduce the number of animals used in
individual projects. Over the past five years, 3M has significantly reduced its
use of regulated laboratory animals through rigorous reviews of scientific
literature and other available data. Efforts are made to make sure that
research proposals do not duplicate earlier work and to discover if relevant
data have already been published.
3M also has demonstrated its commitment to replacing
animal-based tests with non-animal methods through its funding of research of
alternatives to animal testing. 3M has contributed for more than 10 years to
the Johns Hopkins Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing and 3Ms management
actively participates in the Centers activities through board representation.
The proposal disregards the breadth of 3Ms products
and operations. 3M is a diversified technology company with subsidiaries in
more than 60 countries that manufactures and sells more than 50,000 products in
nearly 200 countries. For some of 3Ms products, government agencies, such as
the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency
expressly require that laboratory animal tests be conducted. Selected
non-animal tests that may be acceptable in one country or by one regulatory
agency for one type of product or use of that product are often not acceptable
in another country or by another regulatory agency for that same product or
use.
A requirement to petition applicable regulatory agencies
that require safety testing to accept non-animal alternatives as total
replacements for animal-based methods misses the point where alternatives are
not effective for all of our products.
Because the Company already
limits animal testing to the greatest extent feasible, and because some animal
testing is needed at this time to comply with regulatory and health
requirements, the Company believes this proposal is not feasible and if
adopted, would compromise the Companys ability to develop and market useful
products that meet necessary human safety and efficacy standards.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST
this proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies solicited by the Board
of Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a stockholder
indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.

PROPOSAL
NO. 5
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL
3M has received a stockholder
proposal from Jane Segal of Harrington Investments, Inc., 1001 2nd Street,
Suite 325, Napa, CA 94559 (the Proponent). The Proponent has requested the
Company to include the following proposal and supporting statement in its proxy
statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The proposal may be voted on
at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by the Proponent or the
Proponents qualified representative.
Proponents Proposal:
WHEREAS: our companys business practices in China
respect human and labor rights of workers. The first nine principles below were
designed to commit a company to a widely accepted and thorough set of human and
labor rights standards for China. They were defined by the International Labor
Organization and the United Nations Covenants on Economic, Social &
Cultural Rights, and Civil & Political Rights.
(1)           No goods or products
produced within our companys facilities or those of suppliers shall be
manufactured by bonded labor, forced labor, within prison camps or as part of
reform-through-labor or reeducation-through-labor programs.
(2)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall adhere to wages that meet workers basic needs, fair and decent
working hours, and at a minimum, to the wage and hour guidelines provided by
Chinas national labor laws.
(3)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall prohibit the use of corporal punishment, any physical, sexual
or verbal abuse or harassment of workers.
(4)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall use production methods that do not negatively affect the
workers occupational safety and health.
(5)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall not call on police or military to enter their premises to
prevent workers from exercising their rights.
(6)           We shall undertake to
promote the following freedoms among our employees and the employees of our
suppliers: freedom of association and assembly, including the rights to form
unions and bargain collectively; freedom of expression, and freedom from
arbitrary arrest or detention.
(7)           Company employees and
those of our suppliers shall not face discrimination in hiring, remuneration or
promotion based on age, gender, marital status, pregnancy, ethnicity, region of
origin, labor, political or religious activity, or on involvement in
demonstrations, past records of arrests or internal exile for peaceful protest,
or membership in organizations committed to non-violent social or political
change.
(8)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall use environmentally responsible methods of production that have
minimum adverse impact on land, air and water quality.
(9)           Our facilities and
suppliers shall prohibit child labor, at a minimum comply with guidelines on
minimum age for employment within Chinas national labor laws.
(10)    We will not sell or provide
products or technology in China that can be used to commit human rights
violations or labor rights abuse.
(11)    We will issue annual
statements to the China Working Group detailing our efforts to uphold these
principles and to promote these basic freedoms.
27 


RESOLVED: Stockholders request the Board of Directors
to make all possible lawful efforts to implement and/or increase activity on
each of the principles named above in the Peoples Republic of China.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT: As U.S.
companies import more goods, consumer and shareholder concern is growing about
working conditions in China that fall below basic standards of fair and humane
treatment. We hope that our company can prove to be a leader in its industry
and embrace these principles.
Boards
Statement Opposing the Proposal
3M has long been recognized worldwide as an ethical
and law-abiding company. Although the Company has business operations in more
than 60 countries, 3M has only one set of business conduct policies and human
resource principles that apply globally. These universal standards provide a
framework for conducting business the right way  legally and ethically 
everywhere 3M does business, including the Peoples Republic of China. 3M
opposes the proposal because adopting duplicative principles for one country is
unnecessary and contrary to the benefits derived from one set of standards
applicable to every country where we do business. 3Ms universal standards
relate to and substantially implement each of the principles described in the
proposal and include:
·       Fair Employment and Labor Practices: Our compensation for
our workforce in China significantly exceeds minimum wage requirements. 3M
values a diverse workforce and has extensive programs to identify, hire,
educate and promote employees with a wide range of skills and attributes. 3M
prohibits workplace harassment and respects workers freedom to associate with
each other and organize. 3M has adopted strong worker protection principles
that apply worldwide that prohibit the use of forced or bonded labor, or the employment
of children under the minimum age established by local law.
·       Harassment-free Workplace: It is 3M policy that employees
and others acting on 3Ms behalf are entitled to a working environment that is
free of inappropriate behavior of all kinds and harassment because of age,
disability, marital status, race or color, national origin, religion, sex or
sexual orientation.
·       Environmental, Health and Safety: It is 3M policy to provide
a safe and healthful workplace for its employees, and to minimize the impact of
our production processes and products on the environment.
·       Supplier Expectations: 
We also set specific expectations for our suppliers. These expectations
state that a 3M supplier must, among others: (i) ensure that goods produced for
3M have been manufactured and sold in compliance with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations; (ii) comply with all local country labor laws, including
those related to wages, hours worked, working conditions and child labor; (iii)
not use labor which is a result of mental or physical coercion, physical
punishment, slavery or other oppressive labor conditions; (iv) comply with
applicable country employment discrimination laws; (v) hire and employ workers
in compliance with applicable laws; wages, benefits, and working hours are
expected to be fair and reasonable in the local labor market; and (vi) provide
workers with a safe and healthy work environment that is in compliance with
applicable laws.
Each year, 3M publishes on its Web site a
sustainability report that looks beyond financial reporting and marketplace
performance to present a broader perspective of our Company and our values.
This report provides our employees and a broad external audience with an
overview of the management systems we apply to the economic, social, workforce
and environmental aspects of our business. This report is available not only to
the China Working Group referred to in the stockholder proposal, but to everyone. A copy of the report is available at: http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/_l/en_US/_s.155/115150/_s.155/113842.
28 


In recognition of our commitment to sustainability, 3M
has been selected for inclusion in the 2005 Dow Jones Sustainability Index that
tracks the performance of sustainability-driven companies worldwide. This marks
the fifth year that we have been included in the index and the fourth year that
we have been named the leader in our category of diversified companies.
Our business touches a broad
and diverse group of individuals and organizations  our employees, stockholders,
customers, suppliers, and communities in which we operate. The Companys
universal standards effectively support its responsibilities to each of its
stakeholders. We believe the Companys global business conduct policies, human
resource principles and management systems already address the objectives
sought by the Proponent.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board of Directors recommends a vote AGAINST
this proposal for the reasons discussed above. Proxies solicited by the Board
of Directors will be voted AGAINST this proposal unless a stockholder
indicates otherwise in voting the proxy.

Footnotes
to Summary Compensation Table
(1)   Generally, profit
sharing is paid in cash; however, the Named Executive Officers have in the
past, and may in the future, receive a portion of their profit sharing in

with his employment agreement with the Company.
(2)   Other Annual

employed by the Company. As of December 31, 2004, Mr. Campbell held

Footnotes to Option Grants in
Last Fiscal Year Table
(1)   The Company did not
grant any stock appreciation rights (SARs) during 2004. The options shown for
each individual include both annual grants of nonqualified stock options and
grants of Progressive Stock Options (PSOs). Nonqualified options granted to
certain participants are subject to a reload feature when exercised with the
payment of the option price in the form of previously owned shares of the
Companys common stock. Such an exercise results in further grants of PSOs. The
first grant shown for each individual is the annual grant. The remaining lines
are PSOs. The PSO grants for each individual were made on a single date, but
are, pursuant to SEC rules, shown in multiple lines because of different
expiration dates.
PSO grants were made to participants who exercised
nonqualified stock options and who paid the purchase price using shares of
previously owned Company common stock. The PSO grant is for the number of
shares equal to the shares utilized in payment of the purchase price and tax
withholding, if any. The option price for the PSO is equal to 100 percent of
the market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the exercise of
the primary option. The option period is equal to the remaining period of the
options exercised.
The participant must have owned Company common stock
used for payment for at least six months, and only one exercise of nonqualified
options per participant per calendar year will be eligible for PSO grants by
the Compensation Committee.
34 


The presence of PSOs encourages early exercise of
nonqualified stock options, without foregoing the opportunity for further
appreciation, and promotes retention of the Company stock acquired.
In any event, a
participant receiving an annual grant of nonqualified stock options can never
acquire more shares of Company common stock through successive exercises of the
primary option and subsequent PSO grants than the number of shares covered by
the primary annual option grant from the Committee.
(2)   All options granted
during the period were granted at the market value on the date of grant, as
calculated from the average of the high and low prices reported on the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index. The option price shown for the All Optionees
line is $84.310 and represents the weighted-average exercise price of the
options granted in 2004.
(3)   The expiration date
for the All Optionees line is shown as May 9, 2014, since that is the
applicable date for the vast majority of options granted during 2004.
(4)   Pursuant
to the rules of the SEC, the Company has elected to provide a grant date
present value for these option grants determined by a modified Black-Scholes
pricing model. The Companys use of this model should not be construed as an
endorsement of its accuracy at valuing options. All stock option valuation
models, including the Black-Scholes model, require a prediction about the
future movement of the stock price. Among key assumptions utilized in this
pricing model were: (i) that the time of exercise of stock options would
be 73 months (39 months for PSOs) into the term of the option, which could be
for terms as long as ten years, in recognition of the historical exercise
patterns at the Company for these types of options; (ii) expected
volatility of 23.8 percent (21.6 percent for PSOs); (iii) risk-free rate
of return of 4.1 percent (2.7 percent for PSOs); and (iv) dividend yield
rate of 2.2 percent. No adjustments for non-transferability or risk of
forfeiture have been made. The Company expresses no opinion that the present
value will, in fact, be realized and expressly disclaims any representation to
that effect.

(1)   The
Value Realized or the unrealized Value of Unexercised In-the-Money Options
at FY-End represents the aggregate difference between the market value on the
date of exercise or at December 31, 2004, in the case of the unrealized
values, and the applicable exercise prices. These differences accumulate over
what may be, in many cases, several years. These stock options all have option periods
of 10 years when first granted, and Progressive Stock Options have option
periods equal to the remaining option period of the primary nonqualified
options resulting in Progressive Stock Options.

Footnotes to Long-Term
Incentive Plan Awards Table
(1)  The
Companys Performance Unit Plan (the Plan) provides long-term compensation to
approximately 115 key management personnel based upon the Companys attainment
of long-term performance and growth criteria.
The Compensation Committee administers the Plan. The
Committee has sole discretion in the selection of participants, performance
criteria, size of awards, performance period, and the timing and form of
payment, as well as all other conditions regarding awards.
Awards made in 2004 under the Performance Unit Plan
are based on performance criteria that focus management attention on three key
factors that create stockholder value: Economic Profit Growth, Sales Growth and
Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns. The payout can vary from $0 to $360
per unit. More detail about current performance goals is available in the
Report of the Compensation Committee.
The right to receive
payment is contingent upon continued employment to the payment date, and is
subject to forfeiture prior to the payment date in the event of termination of
employment for any reason other than retirement under a pension plan of the
Company, death, or physical or mental disability. Participants receiving awards
during 2004, including the Named Executive Officers, will receive payment in
2006, provided that such individuals continue employment with the Company until
such payment date (except in the event of death, retirement, or disability).
Payment under the Plan may be made in cash, shares of the Companys common
stock, or any combination of cash and stock, at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee. In the past, payment has been made only in cash.
(2)  The value of awards granted
for 2004 will be determined by the Companys attainment of Economic Profit
Growth, Sales Growth and Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns performance
criteria during a three-year performance period of 2004, 2005, and 2006. More
detail about current performance goals is available in the Report of the
Compensation Committee.
Employment
Contracts, Termination of Employment, and
Change-In-Control Arrangements
Chief Executive Officer
3M has entered into an employment agreement with W.
James McNerney, Jr. providing for his employment as Chief Executive
Officer of the Company and for his election as Chairman of the Board of 3M. The
initial term of the agreement ends on January 1, 2004, but, beginning on January 1,
2002, the term automatically extends so that the remaining term is always two years.
The agreement 
36 


provides for an initial base
salary of $1,300,000 per year and for annual profit sharing initially designed
to pay $2,200,000 per year, depending on the Companys performance. The
agreement also recognizes that Mr. McNerney will be entitled to
participate in the same retirement and welfare benefit programs that the
Company provides to other senior executives.
The agreement also required 3M to grant Mr. McNerney
the following stock options, restricted stock, and performance units under the
Performance Unit Plan:
Stock Options  Effective December 4, 2000, Mr. McNerney
was granted options to purchase 1,200,000 shares of 3M common stock at $51.525
per share. A portion of these options was designed to compensate Mr. McNerney
for the restricted stock and stock options he forfeited upon leaving his prior
employer. 800,000 of these options become exercisable in increments of 20
percent on the 1st of January in the years 2002 through 2006,
and the remaining 400,000 of these options become exercisable in increments of
one-third on the 1st of January in the years 2002 through 2004,
in each case assuming he remains employed by the Company. All 1,200,000 options
will become exercisable in full immediately upon termination of Mr. McNerneys
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, a
termination for good reason, or a change in control of the Company.
Restricted Stock  In order to compensate Mr. McNerney
for the restricted stock and stock options he forfeited upon leaving his prior
employer, the Company also granted Mr. McNerney 220,000 shares of
restricted stock. These shares of restricted stock vest in increments of 10
percent on the 1st of January in the years 2002 through 2011,
assuming he remains employed by the Company, although such vesting accelerates
in the event of the termination of Mr. McNerneys employment by reason of
death or disability, termination without cause, a termination for good reason,
or a change in control of the Company.
Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. McNerney
10,000 performance units for the performance period commencing January 1,
2001, and ending December 31, 2003, subject to the terms of the Companys
Performance Unit Plan. The value of these units and the amount paid to Mr. McNerney
will depend on the performance of the Company, but in no event will the value
be less than $100 per unit nor more than $200 per unit.
The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. McNerney
supplemental retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at least ten
years, the supplemental benefits will be equal in value to an annuity payable
for his lifetime commencing at age 62 and based on 50 percent of his highest
average annual compensation over a three-year period. If Mr. McNerney is
employed by 3M for less than ten years, the amount of these supplemental
retirement benefits will be prorated accordingly. The amount of such benefits
will be reduced by the amount of his benefits under 3Ms pension plans or the
pension plans of his prior employer. These supplemental retirement benefits
vest after five years of employment with the Company, although they vest
immediately in the event of the termination of his employment by reason of
death or disability, termination without cause, a termination for good reason,
or a change in control of the Company.
In the event that Mr. McNerneys
employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, or if Mr. McNerney
terminates his employment for good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum cash
payment equal to three times his annual base salary and profit sharing. As a
condition to receiving such payment, Mr. McNerney would be required to
sign a release of all claims against the Company.
Chief Financial Officer
3M has also entered into an employment agreement with
Patrick D. Campbell providing for his employment as Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of the Company. The term of this agreement began on February 1,
2002, and ends on February 1, 2005. If Mr. Campbells employment with
the Company continues beyond February 1, 2005, his employment would be
governed by the 
37 


same terms and conditions that
apply to other similar executives of the Company. The agreement provides for an
initial base salary of $450,000 per year and for annual profit sharing initially
designed to pay $300,000 per year, depending on the Companys performance. The
agreement also recognizes that Mr. Campbell will be entitled to
participate in certain retirement and welfare benefit programs that the Company
provides to other senior executives, and will be entitled to reimbursement of
his reasonable relocation expenses. For purposes of 3Ms postretirement medical
program, Mr. Campbell will be credited with an opening retiree medical
credit balance as if he had completed 12 years of service with the Company.
The agreement also required 3M to grant Mr. Campbell
the following stock options, restricted stock, and performance units under the
Performance Unit Plan:
Stock Options  Effective February 1, 2002, Mr. Campbell
was granted options to purchase 48,000 shares of 3M common stock at $55.965 per
share. These options become exercisable in increments of one-third on the 1st
of February in the years 2003 through 2005, assuming he remains employed
by the Company. All 48,000 options will become exercisable in full immediately
upon termination of Mr. Campbells employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, or termination for good reason, and in
that event such options shall remain exercisable for up to two years following Mr. Campbells
death, the termination of his employment due to disability, termination without
cause, or termination for good reason. In addition, any portion of these 48,000
options that have already become exercisable may be exercised by Mr. Campbell
within 90 days following his resignation from the Company without good reason.
In May 2002, Mr. Campbell was granted
options to purchase 40,000 shares of 3M common stock at $64.50 per share. All
40,000 options will become exercisable in full immediately upon termination of Mr. Campbells
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason, and in that event such options shall remain
exercisable for up to two years following Mr. Campbells death, the
termination of his employment due to disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason. In addition, any portion of these 40,000 options
that have already become exercisable may be exercised by Mr. Campbell
within 90 days following his resignation from the Company without good reason.
Restricted Stock  The Company also granted Mr. Campbell
6,000 shares of restricted stock. These shares vest in increments of one-third
on the 1st of February in the years 2003 through 2005, assuming
he remains employed by the Company, although such vesting accelerates in the
event of termination of Mr. Campbells employment by reason of death or
disability, termination without cause, or termination for good reason.
Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. Campbell
2,400 performance units for the performance period commencing January 1,
2002, and ending December 31, 2004, subject to the terms of the Companys
Performance Unit Plan. These units will vest at the end of such three-year
performance period, assuming he remains employed by the Company, although such
vesting accelerates in the event of termination of Mr. Campbells
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason. The value of these units and the amount paid to Mr. Campbell
will depend on the performance of the Company, although in the event that the
vesting of such units accelerates due to the termination of Mr. Campbells
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason, the value of such units is limited to their par
value ($120 per unit) multiplied by the ratio of the number of days he was
employed by the Company to the total number of days between February 1,
2002, and December 31, 2004.
The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. Campbell
supplemental retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at least ten
years, the supplemental benefits will be payable in the form of an annuity
payable for his lifetime commencing at age 60 and based on 45 percent of his
highest 
38 


average annual compensation
over a four-year period. If Mr. Campbell is employed by 3M for less than
10 years, the amount of these supplemental retirement benefits will be prorated
accordingly. The amount of such benefits will be reduced by the amount of his
benefits under 3Ms pension plans and the pension plans of his prior employer. Once
he has completed two years of employment with 3M, the sum of these supplemental
retirement benefits and the benefits payable under 3Ms pension plans will not
be less than $100,000 per year. These supplemental retirement benefits (other
than the $100,000 minimum benefit, which vests after two years of employment
with the Company) vest after five years of employment with the Company,
although they vest immediately in the event of the termination of his
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason.
In the event that Mr. Campbells
employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, or if Mr. Campbell
terminates his employment for a good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum
payment equal to (i) two times his annual base salary and profit sharing
if such termination occurs during the first five years following his employment
commencement date, or (ii) one times his annual base salary and profit
sharing if such termination occurs more than five but no more than 10 years
following his employment commencement date. As a condition to receiving such
payment, Mr. Campbell would be required to sign a release of all claims
against the Company.
Senior
Vice President, Legal Affairs and General Counsel
3M has also entered into an employment agreement with
Richard F. Ziegler providing for his employment as Senior Vice President, Legal
Affairs and General Counsel of the Company. The term of this agreement began on
January 1, 2003, and ends on January 1, 2006. If Mr. Zieglers
employment with the Company continues beyond January 1, 2006, his
employment would be governed by the same terms and conditions that apply to
other similar executives of the Company. The agreement provides for an initial
base salary of $600,000 per year and for annual profit sharing initially
designed to pay $400,000 per year, depending on the Companys performance. The
agreement also recognizes that Mr. Ziegler will be entitled to participate
in the same retirement and welfare benefit programs that the Company provides
to its other similarly situated executives, and will be entitled to
reimbursement of his reasonable relocation expenses. For purposes of 3Ms
postretirement medical program, Mr. Ziegler will be credited with an
opening retiree medical credit balance as if he had completed 13 years of
service with the Company.
The agreement also required 3M to pay Mr. Ziegler
the following cash bonus and to grant him the following stock options,
restricted stock, and performance units under the Performance Unit Plan:
Cash Bonus  The agreement provides for a cash-signing
bonus in the amount of $850,000, payable in equal installments on the 1st
of January in the years 2003 through 2005, assuming Mr. Ziegler
remains employed by the Company. Any unpaid installments would become payable
in full immediately upon the termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by
reason of death or disability, termination without cause, termination for good
reason, or a change in control of the Company.
Stock Options  In May 2003, Mr. Ziegler was
granted options to purchase 46,000 shares of 3M common stock at $61.85 per
share. All 46,000 options will become exercisable in full immediately upon
termination of Mr. Zieglers employment by reason of death or disability,
termination without cause, or termination for good reason, and in that event
such options shall remain exercisable for up to two years following Mr. Zieglers
death, the termination of his employment due to disability, termination without
cause, or termination for good reason. In addition, any portion of these 46,000
options that have already become exercisable may be exercised by Mr. Ziegler
within 90 days following his resignation from the Company without good reason.
Restricted Stock  The Company also granted Mr. Ziegler
12,000 shares of restricted stock. These shares vest in increments of one-third
on the 1st of January in the years 2006, 2008, and 2010, 
39 


assuming he remains employed
by the Company, although such vesting accelerates in the event of termination
of Mr. Zieglers employment by reason of death or disability, termination
without cause, termination for good reason, or a change in control of the
Company.
Performance Units  The Company granted Mr. Ziegler
2,400 performance units for the performance period commencing January 1,
2003, and ending December 31, 2005, subject to the terms of the Companys
Performance Unit Plan. These units will vest at the end of such three-year
performance period, assuming he remains employed by the Company, although such
vesting accelerates in the event of termination of Mr. Zieglers
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason. The value of these units and the amount paid to Mr. Ziegler
will depend on the performance of the Company, although in the event that the
vesting of such units accelerates due to the termination of Mr. Zieglers
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason, the value of such units is limited to their par
value ($120 per unit) multiplied by the ratio of the number of days he was
employed by the Company to the total number of days between January 1,
2003, and December 31, 2005.
The agreement also requires 3M to provide Mr. Ziegler
supplemental retirement benefits. If he remains employed by 3M for at least
nine years, the supplemental benefits will be payable in the form of an annuity
payable for his lifetime commencing at age 62 and based on 45 percent of his
highest average annual compensation over a four-year period. If Mr. Ziegler
is employed by 3M for less than nine years, the amount of these supplemental
retirement benefits will be prorated accordingly. The amount of such benefits
will be reduced by the amount of his benefits under 3Ms pension plans. Once he
has completed two years of employment with 3M, the sum of these supplemental
retirement benefits and the benefits payable under 3Ms pension plans will not
be less than $300,000 per year. These supplemental retirement benefits (other
than the $300,000 minimum benefit, which vests after two years of employment
with the Company) vest after five years of employment with the Company,
although they vest immediately in the event of the termination of his
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, or
termination for good reason.
In the event that Mr. Zieglers
employment is terminated by the Company other than for cause, or if Mr. Ziegler
terminates his employment for a good reason, then he will receive a lump-sum
payment equal to (i) two times his annual base salary and profit sharing
if such termination occurs during the first three years following his
employment commencement date, or (ii) one times his annual base salary and
profit sharing if such termination occurs more than three but no more than ten
years following his employment commencement date. As a condition to receiving
such payment, Mr. Ziegler would be required to sign a release of all
claims against the Company.
Retirement Benefits
The
Company maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan for its eligible
employees in the United States. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company amended
this plan (the Employee Retirement Income Plan, or the ERIP) to include a
pension equity feature for (1) employees hired or rehired on or after January 1,
2001, and (2) employees who voluntarily elected the pension equity feature
during the one-time choice election period in 2001. Of the Named Executive
Officers, Dr. Reich and Mr. Wiens participate in the non-pension
equity portion of the ERIP (the Portfolio I Pension Plan), while Mr. McNerney,
Mr. Ziegler, and Mr. Campbell participate in the pension equity
portion of the ERIP (the Portfolio II Pension Plan). Retirement benefits under
the ERIP are based on an employees years of service and average annual
earnings during the employees highest four consecutive years of service. Since
the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of benefits that can be paid from
the ERIP as well as the amount of compensation upon which such benefits may be
earned, the Company also maintains several nonqualified pension plans for
eligible employees. The following table shows the 
40 


estimated annual benefits payable on retirement under
both the ERIP and these nonqualified plans to the Companys eligible employees
in the United States.

Footnotes to Pension Plan Tables
(1)  Earnings include base salary
and profit sharing actually earned by the participant and does not include any
other forms of remuneration. The benefits are computed on the basis of
straight-life annuity amounts and are not subject to any deduction for social
security or other offset amounts.
(2)  Under the Portfolio I plan,
a participant may retire with an unreduced pension at age 60 (61 or 62 for
employees born after 1942) and if the participants age and years of service
total at least 90 (91 or 92 for employees born after 1942) he or she would receive
a social security bridge to age 62. Under the Portfolio II plan, a participant
may retire anytime after age 55 with at least five years of service and their
pension is based on the total pension value determined at retirement converted
to an actuarially equivalent annuity. The Named Executive Officers are
presently entitled to the respective years of service credit set opposite their
names:

COMPENSATION
COMMITTEE REPORT ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors (the Committee) reviews the Companys compensation
practices and policies, annually reviews and approves (subject to ratification
by the independent directors of the Board) the compensation of the Chief
Executive Officer, annually reviews and approves the compensation for the other
senior executives, evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer,
and annually prepares this report on executive compensation for inclusion in
the proxy statement. The Committees membership is determined by the Board of
Directors, and is composed solely of independent nonemployee directors.
Executive
Compensation Philosophy and Practices
The Board
believes that providing appropriate motivation of the Companys executives and
effective leadership are essential for establishing 3Ms preeminence in the
markets we serve and creating an attractive investment for stockholders. The
Committee is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Company executives are
highly qualified and are compensated in a manner that aligns the interests of
executives and stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the following
core principles provide a framework for the Companys executive compensation
programs:
·       Total
compensation must be competitive to attract the best talent to 3M; motivate
employees to perform at their highest levels; reward outstanding achievement; and
retain those individuals with the leadership abilities and skills necessary for
building long-term stockholder value;
·       A
significant portion (targeted at 65 percent to 89 percent) of an executives
total compensation is variable and at risk and tied to both the annual and
long-term financial performance of the Company, such as economic profit and
stock price appreciation; and
·       Stock
ownership is emphasized so that executives manage from an owners perspective.
The Committee believes that broad and deep employee stock ownership effectively
aligns the interests of employees with those of stockholders and strongly
motivates executives to build stockholder value. The Committee has established
specific stock ownership guidelines for key management employees and has
created programs that encourage employees to have an ownership interest in the
Company.
The Committee annually surveys
the executive compensation practices of large industrial companies that are
likely competitors for executive talent. The Committees objective of
maintaining the total compensation at a competitive level has resulted in
short-term compensation (base salary and profit sharing) being at or very close
to the median and long-term compensation (Performance Unit Plan and stock
options) in the 50th to 75th percentile, with more
variability and risk based on Company performance.
Executive compensation is
linked to Company performance compared to specific financial and nonfinancial
objectives. These objectives range from achieving earnings and sales growth
targets to upholding the Companys Statement of Corporate Values (which include
customer satisfaction through superior quality and value, attractive investor
return, ethical business conduct, respect for the environment, and employee
pride in the Company).
42




Components
of Executive Compensation
The compensation program for
executive officers consists of the following components: base salary, profit
sharing, Performance Unit Plan, stock options, and (in appropriate
circumstances) restricted stock. The Committee determines the amount of
compensation under each component of executive compensation granted to the
executive officers to achieve the appropriate ratio between performance-based
compensation and other forms of compensation, and to reflect the level of responsibility
of the executive officer.
Base Salary
The Committee establishes base
salaries annually in relation to base salaries paid by companies included in
the compensation surveys. Base salary for an executive officer is established
each year based on (1) a compensation range corresponding to the executives
responsibilities and (2) the executives overall individual job
performance.
Profit Sharing
Profit sharing is variable
compensation based on the quarterly economic profit of the Company and its
business units. Economic profit is defined as quarterly net operating income
minus a charge for operating capital used by the business. The economic profit
measurement is directly related to the creation of stockholder value since it
emphasizes the effective use of capital and solid profitable growth.
Compensation paid under the profit sharing plan fluctuates based on Company
performance.
The amount payable under this
plan is based on the number of shares of profit sharing assigned to a
participant, multiplied by an amount based on quarterly economic profit. The
total amount paid under this plan to the Companys five most highly compensated
executive officers never exceeds one-half percent of the Companys consolidated
net income for any period, and no single executive officer ever receives more
than one-sixth percent of the Companys consolidated net income for any period.
Profit sharing payments to these individuals are subject to limitations when
individual amounts exceed specified relationships to planned compensation.
Currently, all profit sharing
payments are made in cash. However, the plan does permit the Committee to pay
all or a portion of the profit sharing payable to the Named Executive Officers
in shares of the Companys common stock.
Performance Unit Plan
The Performance Unit Plan is
variable compensation based on the Companys long-term performance. The amount
payable with respect to each performance unit granted is determined by and is
contingent upon attainment of the performance criteria selected each year by
the Compensation Committee over the applicable three-year performance period
(each year weighted equally).
The performance criteria
selected by the Compensation Committee for performance units granted during
2004 were designed to focus management attention on three key factors that
create stockholder value: Economic Profit Growth, Sales Growth, and Improvement
in Net Working Capital Turns.
Performance Criteria:
(1)   Economic Profit Growth is the percentage amount by which the
Economic Profit of the Company for a year exceeds the Economic Profit of the
Company for the immediately preceding year;
(2)   Sales Growth is the percentage amount by which the Companys
worldwide organic sales growth (sales growth adjusted for acquisitions,
inflation and currency effects) exceeds worldwide real sales growth as
reflected in the Industrial Production Index of the top seven industrial
nations in which the Company does business; and
43 


(3)   Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns is the percentage
amount by which the Net Working Capital Turns of the Company for a year
increases from the Net Working Capital Turns for the immediately preceding
year; where the term Net Working Capital Turns means the Companys net sales
during the fourth quarter of a year multiplied by four, and divided by the
Companys Net Working Capital as of the end of such year; and where the term Net
Working Capital means the sum of the Companys accounts receivable and
inventories, minus the Companys accounts payable.
Performance Unit Plan Payments:
The amount payable for each
performance unit granted in 2004 is linked to the performance criteria of
Economic Profit Growth, Sales Growth, and Improvement in Net Working Capital
Turns. The amount payable may be anywhere from $0 to $360 per unit, depending
on the performance of the Company during the three-year performance period
ending on December 31, 2006. Payment for the units granted in 2004 will be
made no later than June 2007, in the form (at the discretion of the
Committee) of cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.
Stock
Options and Restricted Stock
The objectives of the
Management Stock Ownership Program are to help the Company attract and retain
outstanding employees, and to promote the growth and success of the Companys business
by aligning the financial interests of these employees with the other
stockholders of the Company. The Program authorizes the Committee to grant
stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and other stock
awards to employees of the Company. Currently, the Committee makes annual
grants of stock options under the Program to the executive officers. These
options have an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys
common stock on the grant date, and generally expire ten years after the grant
date. Stock options encourage executives to become owners of the Company, which
further aligns their interests with those of the stockholders. These options
only have value to the recipients if the price of the Companys stock
appreciates after the options are granted. Currently, the Committee has made
grants of restricted stock under the Program only to selected executive
officers and other employees in appropriate circumstances. These circumstances
have included the hiring of new executive officers as well as the need to
retain current executive officers. These shares of restricted stock vest over
periods ranging from one to ten years after the grant date, which encourage the
executives to remain employed by the Company until the shares have vested.
Stock Ownership
Guidelines
The Companys stock ownership
guidelines are designed to increase an executives equity stake in 3M and more
closely align his or her interests with those of our stockholders. The
guidelines provide that the CEO should attain an investment position in 3Ms
stock equal to five times his or her annual base salary, Executive and Senior
Vice Presidents should attain an investment position in 3Ms stock equal to
three times their annual base salary, and Vice Presidents who are members of 3Ms
Quarterly Management Council should attain an investment position in 3Ms stock
equal to two times their annual base salary. While the stock ownership
guidelines provide that executives attain these investment positions in 3M
stock within five years of their appointment to these positions, most of our
executives have already attained or exceeded these investment positions.
Chief
Executive Officer Compensation
Effective January 1,
2001, the Company hired W. James McNerney, Jr. as Chairman of the Board
and Chief Executive Officer and entered into an employment agreement. In
determining Mr. McNerneys compensation, the Board focused on competitive
levels of compensation for CEOs managing companies of similar size and
complexity and the importance of hiring a chief executive officer with the
strategic, financial, and leadership skills to ensure the continued growth and
success of the Company. In order to compensate Mr. McNerney for the
restricted stock and stock options he 
44 


forfeited
upon leaving his prior employer, the Company also granted Mr. McNerney
220,000 shares of restricted stock. These shares of restricted stock vest in
increments of ten percent on the 1st of January in the years
2002 through 2011, assuming he remains employed by the Company, although such
vesting accelerates in the event of the termination of Mr. McNerneys
employment by reason of death or disability, termination without cause, a
termination for good reason, or a change in control of the Company.
The terms of Mr. McNerneys
employment agreement appear under Employment Contract, Termination of
Employment, and Change-In-Control Arrangements of this proxy statement.
Subsequent to the hiring of Mr. McNerney
and the negotiation of his employment agreement, the Committee has adjusted his
compensation based on the same principles it follows in determining the
compensation of the Companys other senior executives.
This compensation generally
consists of the same short-term and long-term components (base salary, profit
sharing, Performance Unit Plan awards, and stock options) as those of other
Named Executive Officers. A higher portion of Mr. McNerneys total
compensation is variable and at risk by being tied to quantifiable measures of
the Companys performance. These measures are Economic Profit, Economic Profit
Growth, Improvement in Net Working Capital Turns, Sales Growth, and
appreciation in the value of 3M stock.
In February 2005, the
Committee approved a six percent increase in Mr. McNerneys base salary
(to $1.73 million) and annual planned performance  based profit sharing (to
$2.95 million) respectively, effective February 1, 2005. The Committee
approved this increase, which was subsequently ratified by all of the
nonemployee directors of the Company, following its completion of an evaluation
of Mr. McNerneys performance during 2004. During 2004, the Committee also
approved a long-term incentive award to Mr. McNerney in the form of 18,800
units under the Companys Performance Unit Plan as well as a grant of 375,000
nonqualified stock options under the Companys Management Stock Ownership
Program. The Committee determined the size of this compensation increase as
well as the Performance Unit Plan award and stock option grant based upon a
review of competitive market data as well as Mr. McNerneys individual
performance.
Limit on
Tax Deductible Compensation
Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code prohibits the Company from deducting compensation
paid in any year to certain executives in excess of $1 million but does not
subject performance-based compensation to this limit. The Committee continues
to emphasize performance-based compensation for executives and thus minimize
the effect of Section 162(m). However, the Committee believes that its
primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program that attracts,
retains, and rewards the executive talent necessary for the Companys success.
Consequently, in any year the Committee may authorize nonperformance-based
compensation in excess of $1 million. The Committee recognizes that the loss of
the tax deduction may be unavoidable under these circumstances.
Conclusion
The
Committee is satisfied that the short-term and long-term compensation paid to
the executive officers of the Company is aligned with the Companys strategic
objectives and ensures that payouts are determined by Company and employee
performance.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The role of the Audit
Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Companys
financial reporting process. In performing its oversight function, the Audit
Committee has:
·       Considered
and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management,
which has primary responsibility for the financial statements;

with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), the Companys independent registered
public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Statements on
Auditing Standards No. 61, Communication with Audit Committees, as
currently in effect;
·       Received
the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by Independence Standards
Board Standard No.1, Independence Discussions with Audit Committees, as
currently in effect, and discussed the independence of PwC with them; and
·       Reviewed
the services provided by PwC, other than their audit services, and concluded
that the PwCs provision of such other services is compatible with PwCs
independence.
Based upon the review and discussions described above,
the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited
consolidated financial statements be included in the Companys Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, for filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

Audit Committee
Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of the
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee is
responsible for appointing and overseeing the work of the independent
registered public accounting firm (Independent Accounting Firm). The Audit
Committee has established the following procedures for the pre-approval of all
audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Independent Accounting
Firm.
Before engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm for the
next years audit, the Independent
Accounting Firm will submit a detailed description of services it
expects to render to the Company during that year for each of the following
categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval:
1.    Audit
services include audit work performed in the preparation of consolidated
financial statements, as well as work that generally only the Independent
Accounting Firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort
letters, statutory audits, and attest services and consultation regarding
financial accounting and/or reporting standards.
2.    Audit
related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally
performed by the Independent Accounting Firm, including due diligence related
to mergers and acquisitions, 
46 


employee benefit plan audits,
and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.
3.    Tax
services include all services performed by the Independent Accounting Firms
tax personnel except those services specifically related to the audit of the
financial statements, and includes fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax
planning, and tax advice.
4.    Other
services are those services not captured in the other categories.
Before engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves
these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit
Committee requires the Independent
Accounting Firm to report actual fees versus the budget periodically
throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may
arise when it may become necessary to engage the Independent Accounting Firm for additional services not
contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit
Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Audit Committee has
delegated pre-approval authority to the chair of the committee. The chair must
report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the
Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
FEES OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM
The following table presents
fees for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the
audit of the Companys consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,
2004, and December 31, 2003, and fees billed for other services rendered
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during those periods.

3M STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph compares the five-year cumulative
total stockholder return for 3M common stock (assuming reinvestment of
dividends) against the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), both of which are well-known and published
industry indices. The Company is included in both the S&P 500 Stock Index
and the Dow Jones Industrial group of 30 companies. The Company, as a highly
diversified manufacturer and seller of a broad line of products, is not easily
categorized with other, more specific, industry indices.
The annual changes for the
five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had
been invested in 3M stock and each index on December 31, 1999, as required
by SEC rules, and that all quarterly dividends were reinvested at the average
of the closing stock prices at the beginning and end of the quarter. The total
cumulative dollar returns shown on the graph represent the value that such
investments would have had on December 31, 2004.

APPENDIX
A
3M CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
(As amended February 14,
2005)
The Board of Directors (the Board)
of 3M Company (3M or the Company) has adopted these guidelines, which in
conjunction with the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Board Committee
charters, form the framework for governance of the Company.
A.              THE
ROLES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT
  1.       The Board of Directors  The business of the Company is
conducted under the oversight of the Board of Directors. The Board selects the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and delegates to the CEO the authority and
responsibility to manage the Companys operations. The Board of Directors
serves as elected representatives of the shareholders, acts as an advisor and
counselor to the CEO and senior management, and oversees management performance
on behalf of shareholders. The Board also oversees the Companys strategic and
business planning process and reviews and assesses managements approach to
addressing significant risks facing the Company.
  2.       Management  The CEO and senior management are responsible
for running the Companys business operations.
B.              BOARD
COMPOSITION AND LEADERSHIP
  1.       Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer  The
Board has the authority to decide whether the positions of Chairman and CEO
should be held by the same person and shall determine the best arrangement for
the Company and its shareholders in light of all relevant and changing
circumstances. The Board currently believes that the same individual should
hold the position of Chairman and CEO (Chairman/CEO).
  2.       Size of the Board  The number of Directors should not
exceed a number that can function efficiently. The Nominating and Governance
Committee considers and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the
appropriate size and needs of the Board.
  3.       Board Independence  The Board
believes in having a substantial majority of independent Directors on the 3M
Board. A Director is independent if the Board affirmatively determines that
the Director has no material relationship with the Company directly or as a
partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with
the Company and otherwise meets the requirements for independence of the
listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The independent Directors
will make the Board decisions on corporate governance matters.
  4.       Board Membership Criteria  The Nominating and Governance
Committee periodically reviews with the Board the appropriate skills and
characteristics required of Board members given the current Board composition. It
is the intent of the Board that the Board, itself, will be a high performance
organization creating competitive advantage for the Company. To perform as
such, the Board will be comprised of individuals who have distinguished records
of leadership and success in their arena of activity and who will make
substantial contributions to Board operations and effectively represent the
interests of all stockholders. The Boards assessment of Board candidates
includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (i) roles and
contributions valuable to the business community, (ii) personal qualities
of leadership, character, judgment and whether the candidate possesses and
maintains throughout service on the Board a reputation in the community at
large of integrity, trust, respect, competence and adherence to the highest
ethical standards, (iii) relevant knowledge and diversity of background
and experience in such things as business, manufacturing, technology, finance
and accounting, marketing, international business, 
A-1 


government and the like; or (iv) whether
the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation,
participation and attendance at all meetings. A Directors qualifications in
light of these criteria is considered at least each time the Director is
re-nominated for Board membership.
  5.       Selection of New Director Candidates  The
Nominating and Governance Committee considers qualified director candidates
from several sources, including stockholders, and evaluates candidates against
the current board membership criteria described above. In addition to these
minimum requirements, the Committee will also evaluate whether the candidates
skills are complementary to the existing Board members skills, the Boards
needs for particular expertise in fields such as business, manufacturing,
technology, financial, marketing, international, governmental, or other areas
of expertise, and assess the candidates impact on Board dynamics and effectiveness.
The Committee selects candidates that best suit the Boards current needs and
recommends one or more of such individuals to the Board. Exacting membership
criteria and a rigorous selection process help ensure that candidates
recommended to the Board will effectively represent the balanced best interests
of all stockholders.
  6.       Director Orientation and Continuing Education  The Company
provides Directors with an orientation and education program to familiarize
them with the Companys business operations and plans, industry trends and
corporate governance practices, as well as ongoing education on issues facing
the Company and on subjects that would assist the Directors in discharging
their duties.
  7.       Directors Who Experience Change in Present Job Responsibilities or
Other Relevant Circumstances  When a Directors principal
occupation or business affiliation changes, or other circumstances arise which
may raise questions about the Directors continuing qualifications in relation
to the Board Membership Criteria set forth above, then the Director will tender
her/his resignation, or the Nominating and Governance Committee will ask for
such tender. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the tendered
resignation and recommend to the Board the action to be taken.
  8.       Service On Other For-Profit Boards  Independent Directors
are encouraged to evaluate carefully the time required to serve on other boards
(excluding non-profit) taking into account board attendance, preparation,
participation and effectiveness on these boards. Independent Directors must
advise the Chairman/CEO before accepting an invitation to serve on another
board to enable the Company to determine whether (i) any regulatory issues
or potential conflicts are raised by the Director accepting such an invitation
and (ii) the Director will have the time required for preparation,
participation and attendance at 3M Board meetings. Independent Directors who
also serve as CEOs or in equivalent positions should not serve on more than two
boards of public companies in addition to the 3M Board, and other independent
directors should not serve on more than five other boards of public companies
in addition to the 3M Board. The Board expects that current positions in excess
of these limits will be in compliance with these limits by 3Ms Annual Meeting
in May 2006.
  9.       Retirement Policy  Each non-employee Director must tender
her/his resignation at the annual meeting following her or his 72nd
birthday. If circumstances dictate, the Nominating and Governance Committee may
ask a Director to continue to serve on the Board past age 72.
 10.       Board Compensation Review  The Nominating and Governance
Committee will periodically receive reports on the status of Board compensation
in relation to other large U.S. companies and is responsible for recommending
to the Board changes in compensation for non-employee Directors.
A-2 


 11.       Boards Interaction with Stakeholders  The Chairman/CEO is
responsible for establishing effective communications with the Companys
stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, employees, communities,
suppliers, creditors, governments and corporate partners. It is the policy of
the Board that management speaks for the Company. This policy does not preclude
independent Directors from meeting with stakeholders, but management where
appropriate should be present at such meetings. 
C.             BOARD
OPERATIONS
  1.       Selection of Agenda Items for Board Meetings  At the first
Board meeting of each year, the Chairman/CEO will propose for the Boards
approval agenda items to be discussed during the course of the year. Before
each meeting, the Chairman/CEO will review proposed agenda items that fall
within the scope of responsibilities of a Board committee with the chair of
that committee and distribute the agenda in advance to the Board. Any Board
member may ask to include items on the agenda.
  2.       Board Materials Distributed in Advance  Board members
receive materials related to agenda items in advance of Board meetings so that
the Directors may prepare to discuss the items at the meeting. Sensitive
subjects may be discussed at the meeting without distributing written materials
in advance or at the meeting.
  3.       Director Responsibilities  Directors must exercise their
business judgment to act in the best interests of the shareholders and the
Company. In discharging this obligation, Directors reasonably may rely on the
Companys senior executives and its advisors and auditors. Directors are
expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders and attend and
participate in all meetings of the Board and of committees on which they serve
and to spend the time needed and prepare for and meet as frequently as
necessary to discharge their responsibilities.
  4.       Board Presentations and Access to Employees  Members of
senior management may be invited to attend part or all of a Board meeting in
order to participate in discussions. Generally, the executive responsible for
an area of the Companys operations the Board is to consider makes the
presentation. Board members have complete access to all other members of
management and Company employees.
  5.       Board Access to Independent Advisors  The Board and its
committees may seek advice from outside advisors as appropriate. The Board
shall have sole authority to approve related fees and retention terms.
  6.       Presiding Director at Executive Sessions   Independent
Directors regularly meet without the Chairman/CEO and may select a Director to
chair the meeting. The chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance,
and Public Issues Committees of the Board each preside as the  chair at executive sessions of the
independent Directors at which the principal items to be considered are within
the scope of the committee chairs authority. The Board believes that this
practice ensures leadership at all executive sessions of the independent
Directors.
D.              BOARD
COMMITTEES
  1.       Committees  The current committees are Audit, Compensation,
Nominating and Governance, and Public Issues.
  2.       Assignment and Term of Service of Committee Members  The
Board is responsible for the appointment of committee members and chairs, based
on recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board at its
first meeting following the annual meeting of stockholders shall elect the
members of each Committee.
A-3 


  3.       Agenda, Frequency, Length and Reports of Committee Meetings 
The chair of each committee approves the agenda, length of and attendance at
each committee meeting and determines the frequency of meetings. Materials
related to agenda items are given to the committee members sufficiently in
advance to allow the members to prepare for discussing the items at the
meeting. The committee chairs report a summary of their meeting to the Board
following each regular committee meeting.
  4.       Membership  All Board members may serve on the Public
Issues Committee, but only independent Directors may serve on the Audit,
Compensation, and Nominating and Governance Committees.
  5.       Responsibilities  The Board
periodically reviews the responsibilities of each committee and approves the
committee charters, copies of which are attached to these guidelines.
E.               BOARD
AND MANAGEMENT EVALUATION
  1.       Formal Evaluation of the Chairman/CEO  The Compensation
Committee, in consultation with the Chairman/CEO, sets annual and long-term
performance goals for the Chairman/CEO. The Chair of the Compensation Committee
leads the discussion of the Chairman/CEOs performance against such goals with
the independent Directors and communicates the Boards evaluation to the
Chairman/CEO. The Compensation Committee will use the evaluation when
determining the compensation of the Chairman/CEO.
  2.       Board Self-Assessment  The Board will conduct an annual
self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning
effectively. The Nominating and Governance Committee will receive comments from
all Directors and share those comments with the Board. Based on the comments
and further discussion, the Board will make an assessment specifically
reviewing areas in which the Board and/or the management believe improvements
could be made to increase the effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
  3.       Succession Planning  The Board plans the succession to the
position of Chairman/CEO and certain other senior management positions. To
assist the Board, the Chairman/CEO annually assesses senior managers and their
succession potential. The Chairman/CEO also provides the Board with an
assessment of persons considered potential successors to certain senior
management positions.
  4.       Management Development  The Chairman/CEO annually should
report to the Board on the Companys program for management development.
A-4 


Policy on Adoption of a Rights Plan
In 2002 and 2003, a 3M stockholder submitted a
shareholder proposal to 3M regarding the approval process for adopting a
stockholders rights plan (also known as a poison pill). 3M does not have a
rights plan and is not currently considering adopting one. The Board continues
to believe, however, that there may be circumstances under which adoption of a
rights plan would be necessary to give the Board the negotiating power and
leverage to obtain the best result for 3M stockholders in the context of a
takeover effort.
Following consideration of the favorable vote the
stockholder proposal received and in light of this belief, the Board has
adopted and reaffirmed a statement of policy on this topic. The Boards policy
is that it will only adopt a rights plan if either (1) stockholders have
approved adoption of the rights plan or (2) the Board in its exercise of
its fiduciary responsibilities, including a majority of the independent members
of the Board, makes a determination that, under the circumstances existing at
the time, it is in the best interests of 3Ms stockholders to adopt a rights
plan without the delay in adoption that would come from the time reasonably
anticipated to seek stockholder approval.
The Board has directed the Nominating and Governance
Committee to review this policy statement on an annual basis and to report to
the Board on any recommendations it may have concerning the policy. The terms
of the policy, as in effect, will be included in 3Ms published Corporate
Governance Guidelines and its proxy statement.

to or modifications of the 2005 Program which may be required or necessary to
make such Program comply with the provisions of any laws or regulations of any
country or unit thereof in which the Company operates. To do so, the Committee
may establish different terms and conditions for Awards made to Participants
who live in or are subject to taxation in one or more countries other than the
United States in order to accommodate the tax or other relevant laws of such
countries. The Committee may adopt one or more supplements or sub-plans under
the Program to implement these different terms and conditions.

with respect to more than 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The following types
of Awards may be granted under this 2005 Program:
(a)            Incentive Stock
Options  Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall have a purchase price
equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock on the Grant Date. Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder shall
become exercisable at such time as shall be established by the Committee and
reflected in the documents evidencing such Options, and unless sooner
terminated shall expire on the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date.
F-3 


(b)           Nonqualified Stock
Options  Nonqualified Stock Options granted hereunder shall have a purchase
price equal to no less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value
of a share of Common Stock on the Grant Date. Nonqualified Stock Options
granted hereunder shall become exercisable and shall expire at such time or
times as shall be established by the Committee and reflected in the documents
evidencing such Options; provided, however, that no Nonqualified Stock Option
shall expire later than ten years after the Grant Date (except that the
Committee may extend the exercise period for Nonqualified Stock Options granted
to Participants in any country or countries for an additional period of up to
one year if and to the extent necessary to prevent adverse tax consequences to
such Participants under the laws of such country).
(c)            Progressive Stock Options  Whenever a Participant exercises a Nonqualified Stock Option granted
under the 2002 Program or its predecessors and makes payment of all or part of
the purchase price and withholding taxes, if any, in Common Stock, the
Committee may in its discretion grant such Participant a Progressive Stock
Option. The number of shares subject to such Progressive Stock Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock utilized by the Participant to
effect payment of the purchase price and withholding taxes, if any, for such
Nonqualified Stock Option. Each Progressive Stock Option granted hereunder
shall have a purchase price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair
Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of exercise of the
Nonqualified Stock Option, which shall be the Grant Date of such Progressive
Stock Option. Each Progressive Stock Option granted hereunder shall be
exercisable six months after the Grant Date, and shall expire at the same time
the Nonqualified Option exercised by the Participant would have expired.
(d)           Stock Appreciation
Rights  The term of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Committee
and set forth in the documents evidencing such right, but no Stock Appreciation
Right shall be exercisable more than ten years after the Grant Date. Each Stock
Appreciation Right shall become exercisable at the time or times determined by
the Committee and set forth in the documents evidencing such right. Each Stock
Appreciation Right granted hereunder shall have a grant price equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on
the Grant Date.
(e)            Restricted Stock  At
the time a grant of Restricted Stock is made, the Committee, in its sole
discretion, shall establish a Restricted Period and such additional Conditions as
may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or complete lapse of
restrictions with respect to all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock
represented by the Restricted Stock. The Committee may also, in its sole
discretion, shorten or terminate the Restricted Period or waive any Conditions
with respect to all or any portion of the shares of Common Stock represented by
the Restricted Stock. The Participant shall generally have the rights and
privileges of a stockholder as to such Restricted Stock, including the right to
vote such Restricted Stock, except that the following restrictions shall apply:
(i) the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the shares of
such Restricted Stock until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period
and the satisfaction of any other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if
any; (ii) none of the Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred, assigned,
pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period
and until the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if
any; and (iii) all of the Restricted Stock shall be forfeited and all
rights of the Participant shall terminate without further obligation on the
part of the Company unless the Participant shall have remained a regular
full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and the
satisfaction of the other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any. During
the Restricted Period, at the sole discretion of the Committee, Dividend
Equivalents may be either currently paid or withheld by the Company for the
Participants account, and interest may be paid on the amount of cash dividends
withheld at a 
F-4 


rate and under such terms as
determined by the Committee. Cash or stock dividends so withheld by the
Committee shall not be subject to forfeiture. Upon the forfeiture of any
Restricted Stock, such shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted
Stock shall be transferred to the Company without further action by the
Participant.
(f)                Restricted Stock
Units  At the time a grant of Restricted Stock Units is made, the Committee,
in its sole discretion, shall establish a Restricted Period and such additional
Conditions as may be deemed appropriate for the incremental lapse or complete
lapse of restrictions with respect to all or any portion of such Restricted
Stock Units. The Committee may also, in its sole discretion, shorten or
terminate the Restricted Period or waive any Conditions with respect to all or
any portion of the Restricted Stock Units. During the Restricted Period, the
Participant will not have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such
Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that at the sole discretion of the
Committee, Dividend Equivalents may be either currently paid in cash or shares
or withheld by the Company for the Participants account and reinvested in
additional Restricted Stock Units. Each grant of Restricted Stock Units shall
be subject to the following restrictions: (i) the Participant shall not be
entitled to delivery of the shares of Common Stock corresponding to such
Restricted Stock Units until the expiration or termination of the Restricted
Period and the satisfaction of any other Conditions prescribed by the
Committee, if any; (ii) none of the Restricted Stock Units may be sold,
transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during
the Restricted Period and until the satisfaction of other Conditions prescribed
by the Committee, if any; and (iii) all of the Restricted Stock Units
shall be forfeited and all rights of the Participant shall terminate without
further obligation on the part of the Company unless the Participant shall have
remained a regular full-time employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates until the expiration or termination of the Restricted Period and
the satisfaction of the other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any.
(g)           Other
Stock Awards  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Stock Awards
other than Restricted Stock grants or Restricted Stock Units, and such Stock
Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem with, in replacement
of, or as alternatives to grants or rights under this Program or any other
employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, including the plan of any
acquired entity. If the Committee shall stipulate Conditions with respect to
such Stock Awards, the Conditions will be set forth in documents evidencing the
grant. If Conditions with respect to such Stock Awards shall require the
surrender or forfeiture of other grants or rights under this Program or any
other employee benefit or compensation plan of the Company, then the
Participant shall not have any rights under such Stock Awards until the grants
or rights exchanged have been fully and effectively surrendered or forfeited.
SECTION 7 
SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS
(a)            Payment of Awards may
be in the form of cash, Common Stock or combinations thereof as the Committee
shall determine, and with such other restrictions as it may impose. The
Committee may also require or permit Participants to elect to defer the
issuance of shares or the settlement of Awards in cash under such rules and
procedures as it may establish under the 2005 Program. It may also provide that
deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest on the
deferral amounts denominated in cash or the payment or crediting of Dividend
Equivalents on deferred settlements denominated in shares.
(b)           No shares of Common
Stock shall be issued to any Participant upon the exercise of an Option until
full payment of the purchase price has been made to the Company and the
Participant has remitted to the Company the required federal and state
withholding taxes, if any. A Participant shall obtain no rights as a
stockholder until certificates for such stock are issued to the Participant or
delivered to the MSOP Administrator for credit to the account of the
Participant. Payment of the purchase price or applicable withholding taxes, if
any, may be made in whole, or in part, in shares 
F-5 


of Common Stock,
pursuant to such terms and conditions as may be established from time to time
by the Committee. If payment is made in shares of Common Stock, such stock
shall be valued at one hundred percent (100%) of their Fair Market Value on the
day the Participant exercised his or her Option or, as regards a withholding
tax, such other date when the tax withholding obligation becomes due. A
Participant need not surrender shares of Common Stock as payment; and the
Company may, upon the giving of satisfactory evidence of ownership of said
Common Stock by Participant, deliver the appropriate number of additional
shares of Common Stock reduced by the number of shares required to pay the purchase
price and any applicable withholding taxes. Such form of evidence shall be
determined by the Committee.
SECTION 8 
DELIVERY OF STOCK CERTIFICATES
(a)            Within sixty (60) days
after completion of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or
the complete satisfaction of Conditions applicable to a Stock Award, the
Company will have delivered to the Participant or to the MSOP Administrator for
credit to the account of the Participant certificates representing all shares
of Common Stock purchased or received thereunder. The Company shall not,
however, be required to issue or deliver any certificates for its Common Stock
prior to the admission of such stock to listing on any stock exchange on which
stock may at that time be listed or required to be listed, or prior to
registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The Participant shall have no
interest in Common Stock until certificates for such stock are issued or
transferred to the Participant or to the MSOP Administrator for credit to the
account of the Participant and the Participant becomes the holder of record.
(b)           Upon the expiration or
termination of the Restricted Period and the satisfaction of other Conditions
prescribed by the Committee, if any, the restrictions applicable to a grant of
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall lapse and a stock certificate
for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the Restricted Stock or
Restricted Stock Units shall be delivered to the Participant or the Participants
beneficiary, representative, or estate, as the case may be, free of all
restrictions, except any that may be imposed by law. Unless otherwise
instructed by a Participant by an irrevocable, written instruction received by
the Company at least six months prior to the date that applicable restrictions
lapse, the Company shall automatically withhold as payment the number of shares
of Common Stock, determined by the Fair Market Value at the date of the lapse,
required to pay withholding taxes, if any.
(c)            In
no event will the Company be required to deliver any fractional share of Common
Stock in connection with any Award. In the event that a Participant shall be
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Common Stock in connection with an
Award granted under this 2005 Program, the Company shall pay in cash, in lieu
thereof, the Fair Market Value of such fractional share.
SECTION 9 
TAX WITHHOLDING
Prior to the payment or
settlement of any Award, the Participant must pay, or make arrangements
satisfactory to the Company for the payment of, any and all tax withholding
that in the opinion of the Company is required by law. The Company shall have
the right to deduct applicable taxes from any Award payment, to withhold from
the shares of Common Stock being issued or delivered in connection with an
Award an appropriate number of shares for the payment of taxes required by law,
or to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company
to satisfy all obligations for the withholding of such taxes.
SECTION 10 
TRANSFERABILITY
Except as permitted in this Section 10,
no Award granted under this 2005 Program may be assigned, transferred (other
than a transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution as provided 
F-6 


in Section 11),
pledged, or hypothecated (whether by operation of law or otherwise). Awards
granted under this 2005 Program shall not be subject to execution, attachment,
or similar process. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit
individual Participants to transfer the ownership of all or any of their Nonqualified
Options granted under this 2005 Program to (i) the spouse, children or
grandchildren of such Participant (Immediate Family Members), (ii) a
trust or trusts for the exclusive benefit of such Immediate Family Members, or (iii) a
partnership in which such Immediate Family Members are the only partners,
provided that (x) there may be no consideration for any such transfer, and
(y) subsequent transfers of transferred Nonqualified Options shall be
prohibited except those in accordance with Section 11 (by will or the laws
of descent and distribution). The Committee may, in its sole discretion, create
further conditions and requirements for the transfer of Nonqualified Options. Following
transfer, any such Nonqualified Options shall continue to be subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer,
provided that for purposes of Sections 7, 8 and 14 hereof the term Participant
shall be deemed to refer to the transferee. The events causing termination of
Awards in accordance with Section 11 hereof shall continue to be applied
with respect to the original Participant, following which the Nonqualified
Options shall be exercisable by the transferee only to the extent, and for the
periods specified in Section 11.
SECTION 11 
TERMINATION OF AWARDS
(a)            If a Participants
employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than (i) a
Disqualifying Termination, (ii) Retirement, (iii) a physical or
mental disability as recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company,
or (iv) death, and prior to the date of termination the Participant has
not fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this
2005 Program, such Participant may exercise the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right within ninety (90) days following the date of termination (but not beyond
the expiration date of such Option or Right) for the number of shares which the
Participant could have purchased or received a payment on the date of
termination. At the conclusion of such ninety-day period (with respect to the
Participants Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, and at the time of
termination with respect to any other Awards), participation hereunder shall
cease and all of the Participants Awards granted under this 2005 Program shall
be automatically forfeited unless the documents evidencing such Options or
Stock Appreciation Rights provide otherwise.
(b)           If a Participant
Retires or changes employment status as a result of a physical or mental
disability as recognized under a benefit plan maintained by the Company,
without having fully exercised an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the
Participant shall be entitled, within the remaining term of the Option or Stock
Appreciation Right (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or
Right), to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation Right. If a Participant
who has thus Retired dies, without having fully exercised an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any
portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participants death)
may be exercised within two years after the date of his or her death (but not
beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the Participants estate
or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock
Appreciation Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the
Participant.
(c)            If a Participant,
prior to Retirement, dies without having fully exercised an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right, the Option or Stock Appreciation Right (including any
portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of the Participants death)
may be exercised within two years following his or her death (but not beyond
the expiration date of such Option or Right) by the Participants estate or by
a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option or Stock Appreciation
Right by bequest or inheritance or by reason of the death of the Participant.
(d)           Notwithstanding
paragraph (a) of this section, if a Participants employment with the
Company is terminated before he or she has fully exercised an Option or Stock
Appreciation Right under 
F-7 


circumstances which the
Committee believes to warrant special consideration and the Committee has
determined that the Participants rights should not be forfeited at the time or
times specified in paragraph (a), the Option or Stock Appreciation Right
(including any portion thereof not already exercisable at the time of
termination) may be exercised within two years following his or her termination
of employment (but not beyond the expiration date of such Option or Right).
(e)            If a Participant dies,
either prior to or following Retirement, or becomes totally disabled because of
a physical or mental disability, and has not yet received the stock certificate
for the shares of Common Stock represented by a grant of Restricted Stock or
other Stock Award, then all restrictions imposed during the Restricted Period
and any other Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any, shall
automatically lapse and a stock certificate shall be delivered to the
Participant or the Participants beneficiary, representative, or estate, as the
case may be.
(f)                If a Participants
employment with the Company is terminated due to a Disqualifying Termination,
participation hereunder shall cease and all of the Participants Awards granted
under this 2005 Program shall be automatically forfeited.
(g)           If
the Committee or the officers to whom it delegates the necessary authority
receive or have reason to believe that the Company has received credible
evidence that a Participant may have engaged in activity described in the term Disqualifying
Termination in Section 2(h) of this 2005 Program, the Committee or
such officers may suspend the exercise, delivery or settlement of all or any
portion of such Participants outstanding Awards granted under this 2005
Program pending an investigation of the matter.
SECTION 12 
ADJUSTMENTS
In the event of any change in
the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of a stock split, stock
dividend, combination or reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger
or similar event, the Committee shall adjust proportionately: (a) the
number of shares of Common Stock (i) available for issuance or delivery
under the 2005 Program in accordance with Section 3, (ii) for which
Awards may be granted to a single Participant in accordance with Section 6,
and (iii) subject to outstanding Awards granted under the 2005 Program; (b) the
purchase prices of outstanding Awards; and (c) the appropriate Fair Market
Value and other price determinations for such Awards. In the event of any other
change affecting the Common Stock or any distribution (other than normal cash
dividends) to holders of Common Stock, such adjustments in the number or kind
of shares and the purchase prices, Fair Market Value and other price
determinations of the affected Awards as the Committee shall, in its sole
discretion, determine are equitable, shall be made and shall be effective and
binding for all purposes of such outstanding Awards. In the event of a
corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets or stock, separation,
reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized to cause the
Company to issue or assume stock options, whether or not in a transaction to
which section 424(a) of the Code applies, by means of substitution of new
stock options for previously issued stock options or an assumption of
previously issued stock options. In such event, the aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock available for issuance or delivery under the 2005 Program in
accordance with Section 3 will be increased to reflect such substitution
or assumption, and such shares substituted or assumed shall not be counted
against the individual Participant maximum set forth in Section 6.
SECTION 13 
TERM, AMENDMENT, AND
TERMINATION OF THE 2005 PROGRAM
The 2005 Program shall become
effective on the date it is approved by the requisite vote of the stockholders
of 3M Company, and shall expire (unless it is terminated before then) on the
third anniversary of such effective date. Such expiration shall not adversely
affect Awards granted under the 
F-8 


2005 Program
prior to such expiration date. The Board of Directors may at any time amend or
terminate the 2005 Program, except that no amendment or termination shall
adversely affect Awards granted under the 2005 Program prior to the effective
date of such amendment or termination; provided, however, that no amendment
shall be made without the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock represented and entitled to vote on such
amendment which would (i) increase the aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock available for issuance or delivery under the 2005 Program in
accordance with Section 3 (except for adjustments made in accordance with Section 12),
(ii) permit the granting of Awards with purchase prices lower than those
specified in Section 6, or (iii) be a material amendment for which
stockholder approval is required by applicable law, regulation or stock
exchange rule.
SECTION 14 
CHANGE IN CONTROL
(a)            For purposes of this Section 14,
the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated below, unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise:
                                    (i)  Person shall have the meaning associated
with that term as it is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Act.
                                 (ii)  Affiliates and Associates shall have the
meanings assigned to such terms in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under Section 12
of the Act.
                              (iii)  Act means the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
                              (iv)  Continuing Directors shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Article Thirteenth of the Certificate of
Incorporation of 3M Company.
(b)           Notwithstanding any
other provision of this 2005 Program to the contrary, all outstanding Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights shall (i) become immediately exercisable in
full for the remainder of their respective terms upon the occurrence of a
Change in Control of the Company, and (ii) remain exercisable in full for
a minimum period of six months following the Change in Control;
provided, however, that in no event shall any Option or Stock Appreciation
Right be exercisable beyond the original expiration date.
(c)            Similarly, all
restrictions regarding the Restricted Period or the satisfaction of other
Conditions prescribed by the Committee, if any, with respect to grants of
Restricted Stock or other Stock Awards, shall automatically lapse, expire, and
terminate and the Participant shall be immediately entitled to receive a stock
certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock represented by the
Restricted Stock or Stock Awards upon the occurrence of a Change in Control.
(d)           For purposes of this Section 14,
a Change in Control of the Company shall be deemed to have occurred if:
                                    (i)  any Person (together with its Affiliates and
Associates), other than a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under
an employee benefit plan of the Company, is or becomes the beneficial owner
(as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Act),
directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the combined voting power of the Companys then
outstanding securities, unless a majority of the Continuing Directors of the
Board of Directors prior to that time have determined in their sole discretion
that, for purposes of this 2005 Program, a Change in Control of the Company has
not occurred; or
                                 (ii)  the Continuing Directors of the Board of
Directors shall at any time fail to constitute a majority of the members of
such Board of Directors.
F-9 


(e)            In the event that the
provisions of this Section 14 result in payments that are finally
determined to be subject to the excise tax imposed by section 4999 of the Code,
the Company shall pay to each Participant an additional amount sufficient to
fully satisfy such excise tax and any additional federal, state, and local
income taxes payable on the additional amount.
(f)                The
Company shall pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable legal and
accounting fees and expenses incurred by such Participant in seeking to obtain
or enforce his or her rights under this Section 14, or in connection with
any income tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the
application of section 4999 of the Code to the payments made pursuant to this Section 14,
unless a lawsuit commenced by the Participant for such purposes is dismissed by
the court as being frivolous or otherwise improper under applicable court rules.
The Company shall also pay to each Participant the amount of all reasonable tax
and financial planning fees and expenses incurred by such Participant in
connection with such Participants receipt of payments pursuant to this Section 14.
SECTION 15 
MISCELLANEOUS
(a)            Unless otherwise
specifically determined by the Committee, settlements of Awards received by
Participants under the 2005 Program shall not be deemed a part of any
Participants compensation for purposes of determining such Participants
payments or benefits under any Company benefit plan, severance program, or
severance pay law of any country. Nothing in this 2005 Program shall prevent
the Company from adopting other or additional compensation programs, plans, or
arrangements as it deems appropriate or necessary.
(b)           The 2005 Program shall
be unfunded. The Company does not intend to create any trust or separate fund
in connection with the 2005 Program. The Company shall not have any obligation
to set aside funds or segregate assets to ensure the payment of any Award. The
2005 Program shall not establish any fiduciary relationship between the Company
and any Participant or other person. To the extent any person holds any rights
by virtue of an Award under the 2005 Program, such right (unless otherwise
determined by the Committee) shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured
general creditor of the Company.
(c)            No person shall have
any claim or right to be granted an Award under the 2005 Program, and the
Participants shall have no rights against the Company except as may otherwise
be specifically provided herein. Nothing in this 2005 Program shall be deemed
to give any Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company,
or to interfere with the right of the Company to discipline or discharge such
Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever.
(d)           The provisions of this
2005 Program and the documents evidencing Awards granted under this 2005
Program shall be construed and interpreted according to the laws of the State
of Minnesota.
(e)            In case any provision
of this 2005 Program shall be ruled or declared invalid for any reason, said
illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions, and the
remainder of the 2005 Program shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.
